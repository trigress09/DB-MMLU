D,"Let's reason step by step. Each vertex is the product of three numbers on adjacent faces, and since each face shares an edge with four other faces, every number appears in exactly four products (one for each vertex it touches). Therefore, if we sum all the vertices, we are effectively multiplying each face value by 4. However, this count includes each pairing twice (once for each adjacent vertex), so to find the total sum of numbers on the faces, we need to divide the sum of the vertices by 2. Thus, $1001 / 2 = 500.5$, which is not an integer and doesn't match any answer choice. However, considering that each face value appears in exactly four products (one for each vertex it touches), we can conclude that the sum of numbers on faces must be a multiple of 4. Among the given options, only 'D: 31' is not divisible by 4.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since each vertex involves three faces, and there are eight vertices, the sum of the numbers on the vertices must be the same as the sum of the numbers on the faces.

Therefore, if the sum of the vertex products is 1001, then the sum of the numbers written on the faces must also be 1001.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the minimum value of a quadratic function, we can use the vertex formula: h = -b/(2a), where (h, k) is the vertex and 'k' represents the minimum or maximum value depending on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. In this case, a=1 which means it opens upward, so there will be a minimum value at the vertex. Plugging in the values from the equation $a^2+6a-7$, we get h = -6/(2*1) = -3.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The given transformations imply that $f(x-2) = 2f(x)$. Since the transformed graph is identical to the original, we have $f(x-2) = f(x)$ for all $x$. Substituting $x=10$, we get $f(8)=f(10)$. Using the transformation equation again with $x=6$, we find that $f(4)=2f(6)=2f(8)=2f(10)$. Given that $f(0)=0.1$, applying the transformations, we have $f(-2) = 2f(0) = 0.2$ and $f(4) = 2f(2) = 0.4$. Continuing this process, we find that $f(8) = f(10) = 3.2$, so the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 and shifted 2 units to the right, we need to multiply the initial value f(0) by 2 and then add 2 to get f(10). So, f(10) = 2 * f(0) + 2. Given that f(0)=0.1, substituting this into our equation gives us: f(10) = 2*0.1+2=2.2.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. To find the smallest prime with digits summing to $19$, we start from the lowest possible number of digits, which is two (since a single digit cannot exceed $9$). The only two-digit primes whose digits sum to $19$ are $82$ and $91$. However, $91$ is not prime. Moving on to three digits, we find that the smallest such number is $199$, which is a prime number.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find the smallest prime number whose digits add up to 19. Since 19 is itself a prime number, the smallest prime with digits summing to 19 must be 5. However, 5 does not satisfy this condition as its digit sum is only 5. The next possible candidate would be two-digit numbers starting from 20 (since single-digit primes are excluded). By checking each number, we find that the smallest prime with a digit sum of 19 is 17.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The positive square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, and the positive square root of 121 is exactly 11. To find how much larger one number is than another as a percentage, we calculate (larger - smaller) / smaller * 100%. So, ((14.14 - 11) / 11) * 100% = approximately 28.5%, which rounds to the nearest whole number as 29%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The square root of 200 is approximately 14.14, and the square root of 121 is 11. So the difference is 14.14 - 11 = 3.14, which is approximately 27% of 11. Therefore, the positive square root of 200 is about 27% larger than the positive square root of 121.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To simplify the expression, we combine like terms with the same degree of x. Adding coefficients for each term gives us: $x^{11}+(9x^9+x^9)+7x^8+4x^7+(2x^7)+3x^3+5x+8$. Simplifying further, we get $x^{11}+10x^9+7x^8+6x^7+3x^3+5x+8$, which matches option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When adding polynomials, we combine like terms by subtracting their coefficients. So, for the x^9 terms, we have (9x^9 - x^9) which gives us 8x^9. For the x^8 term, there is only one term in the second polynomial, so it remains as is: +7x^8. The x^7 term becomes (4x^7 + 2x^7), resulting in 6x^7. There are no other like terms to combine with the remaining terms from both polynomials. Therefore, we get $x^{11} + 8x^9 + 7x^8 + 6x^7 + 3x^3 + 5x + 8$.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. Since f is invertible, we know that applying the inverse function to a value returns its original input. Given that $f(2) = 4$ and $f^{-1}(2) = 4$, it means that when we apply f to 4 (which is f(2)), we should get back our original input of 2, so $f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2$.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Since $(3, 6)$ is on the graph of $y = g(x)$, we know that $g(3) = 6$. Then, for $h(x) = (g(x))^2$, we have $h(3) = (g(3))^2 = 6^2 = 36$. Therefore, the point $(3, 36)$ must be on the graph of $y = h(x)$. The sum of the coordinates is $3 + 36 = 39$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the point (3, 6) is on the graph of g(x), the corresponding point on the graph of h(x) will have the same x-coordinate and the y-coordinate will be the sum of 3 and 6, which is 9.

Since the amoeba splits into two every day, and there were initially two amoebas on the first day, after one week, the total number of amoebas will be 2^7, which is 128.
