B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson, a prominent emotivist philosopher, argued that ethical judgments are expressions of personal attitudes and feelings rather than statements of fact or objective truths. They primarily serve to express one's own approval or disapproval towards certain actions or behaviors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical judgments are personal and subjective, reflecting an individual's approval or disapproval of certain actions or behaviors. They express one's own moral perspective rather than stating objective facts or directly influencing others' interests.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The veil of ignorance is a concept introduced by philosopher John Rawls, which suggests that when designing principles of justice for society, one should do so without knowing their own position in that society. This ensures impartiality and fairness as individuals would not want to create disadvantages for themselves. Therefore, the purpose of the veil of ignorance is to prevent contractors from adopting principles of justice that unfairly advantage themselves.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The veil of ignorance is designed to streamline the selection of just principles, ensuring they are clear and accessible to everyone. It aims to eliminate bias by preventing individuals from knowing their place in society when choosing these principles. This approach helps ensure fairness as it prevents contractors from adopting principles that unfairly advantage themselves or others based on social position.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasized the importance of self-reflection and critical examination in leading a meaningful life. His statement suggests that without introspection and understanding one's actions and beliefs, life lacks value. The option that best aligns with this interpretation is C: simply doing whatever everyone else does without thinking about why we should do what we do can hardly be thought of as worthwhile, noble, or admirable.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that while introspection is enriching, life's true meaning resides in the unanalyzed moments and experiences we encounter. He emphasized the importance of self-reflection to understand one's purpose and values. The statement suggests that without examining our lives, they lack depth and significance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's idealism, if Forms changed, it would undermine their role as the perfect and immutable standards for all things in the sensible realm. This means that objects in the sensible world could not be identified or known consistently because they wouldn't have a stable form to compare against. The correct answer is that nothing in the experienced world could be or be identified as one determinate thing or another.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Forms were mutable, our sensory experiences would be limited to abstract concepts, devoid of any connection to the physical world. This is because changing Forms would prevent us from recognizing and identifying objects in the sensible realm as distinct entities.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Kant, laws of nature govern events as they actually occur without any moral considerations, while laws of freedom are concerned with how things should or ought to be based on rationality and morality.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both laws of nature and laws of freedom govern the inevitable course of events, determining what will transpire in the world. However, while laws of nature dictate how things naturally occur without human intervention or moral considerations, laws of freedom encompass ethical principles that guide actions towards desired outcomes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The view that art is defined primarily by its form, structure, and composition rather than content or context aligns with the principles of formalism. Formalism emphasizes the visual elements of a work of art such as color, line, shape, and texture.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Informalism prioritizes the lack of formal structures and rules in art, allowing for greater freedom and expression. Expressionism focuses on representing emotional experiences rather than physical reality. Structuralism analyzes cultural phenomena within a broader system or structure. Formalism emphasizes the importance of form over content in defining art.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that the pursuit of social status, wealth, power, and pleasure were indicative of a person being misguided in their priorities, focusing on materialistic and superficial aspects rather than cultivating virtue and wisdom. This imbalance was seen as detrimental to one's soul. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that such pursuits are signs of an unhealthy soul.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that a single-minded focus on achieving social status and wealth signifies a deep philosophical ambition and a desire for knowledge. However, he also warned against the dangers of such pursuits when they become exclusive and neglect other aspects of life. In this context, the most appropriate answer is an unhealthy soul.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In the dialogue 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion', Cleanthes uses an analogy comparing the universe to a man-made machine, arguing for the existence of a designer (God). Philo criticizes this argument as flawed because it assumes that order and design necessarily imply a divine creator. Therefore, Philo would likely say that the analogy is not based on a legitimate method of reasoning.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cleanthes employs a compelling analogy that effectively strengthens his argument and persuades the audience of his viewpoint. The analogy is well-structured, relevant to the topic at hand, and supports the overall case being made.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, in his philosophical writings, emphasized the importance of understanding moral truths for achieving happiness. He believed that knowing the causes of good and evil is essential to live a virtuous life, which leads to true happiness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that true happiness is attainable without delving into the complexities of good and evil or the causes of natural events. Instead, he emphasized the importance of God's grace for achieving happiness.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, an 18th-century philosopher, defined virtue in terms of moral sentiments rather than consequentialist outcomes. He believed that virtues are qualities or actions that elicit a positive response from observers, leading to feelings of approval and admiration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Virtue, as defined by Hume, is primarily concerned with the pursuit of justice and the establishment of a fair and equitable society. While happiness may be an outcome of virtuous actions, it is not the defining characteristic according to Hume's philosophy.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, emphasized virtues in his works. He believed that justice is fundamental to society, generosity strengthens social bonds, and kindness promotes harmony among people. Therefore, according to Cicero, it would be expedient to embody all these qualities.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero argued that expediency is primarily linked to acts of kindness and compassion, as they foster positive social interactions and benefit individuals. However, he also emphasized justice and generosity in his works, considering them essential virtues for a well-functioning society.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. G.E.M. Anscombe, in her work 'Modern Moral Philosophy', argues that the concept of moral obligation is not derived from preference or utility but rather from a recognition of law and duty. She emphasizes the importance of divine law as the foundation for understanding moral obligations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of moral obligation arises from our personal preferences and the things we deem important or desirable in life. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher, argued that morality is not derived from divine law, positive law, or maximizing utility but rather from individual preference.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle, in his ethical philosophy, categorizes virtues into two main types based on their nature and the aspects of human life they pertain to. Moral virtues are related to character and behavior, while intellectual virtues concern knowledge and wisdom.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle classified virtues into two distinct categories: natural virtues, which are innate and inherent, and artificial virtues, which are acquired through learning and practice. However, in his ethical works, he specifically divides them into moral virtues (related to character) and intellectual virtues (related to the mind). Therefore, the correct answer is that Aristotle divides the virtues into moral virtues and intellectual virtues.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Aquinas, a medieval philosopher and theologian, argued that all human actions are directed towards some end or purpose (telos). He believed that pleasure is not an ultimate goal but rather a consequence of performing activities well. Thus, according to Aquinas, operations exist for their own sake, and any resulting pleasure is secondary.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas posits that the purpose of operation or action is to ultimately attain pleasure and satisfaction. He argues that actions are directed towards achieving a good end, which is often associated with pleasure. Therefore, operations exist for the sake of obtaining pleasure.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Plato, the highest form of knowledge is understanding the essence or 'logos' of things rather than just categorizing them based on experiences. This means that knowing why something exists in its particular way (its rationale) is superior to simply recognizing it as a certain kind of thing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Knowledge of pure reason surpasses conceptual understanding because it sheds light on the variations and discrepancies in human knowledge and perspectives. It allows us to understand why different individuals may have differing opinions about what they claim to know, which is a key aspect of Plato's philosophy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a prominent theologian and philosopher, believed that all things strive for their own perfection according to their nature. For humans, this ultimate perfection is found in Godliness or union with God, as it fulfills our highest purpose and potential.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that the pinnacle of operational perfection lies in the attainment of pleasure and the gratification of desires. This is because, for him, all actions are directed towards achieving some form of good or end result which brings about satisfaction.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The systematic use of critical reasoning to explore fundamental questions about reality, morality, and knowledge is a hallmark of philosophy. This method involves questioning assumptions, analyzing concepts, and constructing logical arguments. Among the given options, 'the philosophical method' best describes this process.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The philosophical method relies heavily on argumentation and debate, aiming to persuade others and emerge victorious in intellectual discussions. It involves critical thinking and logical analysis of fundamental questions about reality, morality, and knowledge.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is a famous portrait that depicts a woman with realistic features and details, representing her likeness in a recognizable form. This style aligns with representational art rather than abstract or nonrepresentational styles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa falls under the category of nonrepresentational art, as it does not depict any identifiable figures or objects from the real world. Instead, it focuses on capturing emotions and expressions through subtle details and techniques.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter Singer argues for a principle of equal consideration of interests that extends beyond humans, requiring us to prevent suffering when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. This implies significant changes in both personal habits and societal structures to address issues like animal welfare and global poverty.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's principle advocates for moderate changes in our personal habits, without necessitating significant societal transformations. His argument focuses on individual responsibility rather than systemic change.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's theory, known as 'effective altruism', emphasizes the importance of reducing suffering and helping others regardless of proximity or personal relationships. One objection he considers is that his approach might not adequately address the moral significance of our closer relationships with loved ones compared to strangers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A major flaw in Singer's theory is its failure to acknowledge the greater moral obligations we have towards our family and friends compared to strangers. While his utilitarian approach emphasizes reducing suffering globally, it overlooks the inherent importance of personal relationships and duties.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's ideal utilitarianism is a form of consequentialist ethics that focuses on the consequences of actions in terms of promoting overall good or value, rather than just pleasure or happiness. The right action according to this theory would be one that maximizes the amount of 'good', which can encompass various aspects beyond mere pleasure or happiness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ideal utilitarianism, like other forms of utilitarianism, aims to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people. However, Moore's ideal utilitarianism specifically focuses on promoting 'good', which encompasses more than just pleasure or happiness but also includes virtues and overall well-being.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Paley argues that the complexity of a watch implies an intelligent designer, just as the intricate design found in nature suggests a divine creator. The key difference he points out is not simplicity or age but rather the scale and grandeur of natural systems compared to human-made objects like a watch.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nature, unlike a watch, has existed for a much longer period, allowing for the development of intricate and complex systems. Paley argues that nature's design is more grandiose than human-made contrivances due to its vastness and complexity.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that understanding the essence or underlying principles of justice and virtue is crucial for applying them in various situations. Knowledge of individual examples alone would be insufficient, as it wouldn't equip someone to handle new scenarios where those specific examples don't apply directly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since justice and virtue are universal aspirations shared by all humans, understanding individual examples is sufficient to grasp their essence. Knowledge of specific instances does not necessarily require comprehension of the underlying principles that define them as just or virtuous actions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that deliberative justification, which is based on rationality and self-interest, can be reconciled with moral requirements through a social contract approach. This means that once we acknowledge the importance of morality in our interactions, it doesn't refute or replace deliberative justification but rather complements it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that deliberative justification directly contradicts and undermines the principles of morality. He believes that moral requirements cannot be overridden or ignored in favor of self-interest, which is what deliberative justification often entails.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Paley's argument is based on the watchmaker analogy, where he argues that just as a watch with its complex and purposeful design implies an intelligent designer, so too does nature imply a divine creator. The key aspect of this analogy is not merely having structure or running well but showing purposefulness in design.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A well-functioning watch, with its ability to keep accurate time, clearly demonstrates the need for a skilled designer. Paley argues that just as we infer an intelligent creator from observing complex and purposeful objects like a watch, so too should we conclude there is a divine designer when looking at the complexity of nature.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' theory consists of two main principles: the principle of equal basic liberties and the difference principle, which states that social and economic inequalities should benefit the least advantaged members of society. These parts are interdependent as they work together to form a just society according to Rawls.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' theory, like other philosophical frameworks, is built upon fundamental principles that are inherently true and can be rationally deduced. His two main parts of the theory - 'Justice as Fairness' and the 'Original Position', along with its veil of ignorance concept - form a coherent system where one part supports and justifies the other, making them interdependent.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel introduces the problem of moral luck to highlight how factors beyond an individual's control can influence their moral responsibility, despite our intuition that morality should only depend on actions within one's control. The issue arises because our theories of human action and moral judgment do not align with this intuition, leading to situations where individuals are held responsible for outcomes influenced by luck.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The problem of moral luck arises from the limitations of our current theories on human actions and their consequences. Nagel argues that despite our best efforts, we cannot fully account for all factors influencing an individual's actions when assigning moral responsibility.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hare, a moral philosopher, argues that making positive moral judgments is essential for coherent invocation of morality to protect one's own interests. Without such judgments, it would be difficult to justify actions or decisions based on moral grounds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Refusing to make positive moral judgments is inherently immoral as it implies a disregard for ethical principles. However, the question specifically asks about Hare's claim regarding such an individual. According to R.M. Hare's prescriptivism in meta-ethics, making no positive moral judgments would lead to inconsistency when invoking morality to protect one's own interests.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Derek Parfit, in his work on personal identity and ethics, argues that the well-being of individuals can be affected differently depending on various factors such as psychological continuity and connectedness. He suggests that an outcome could indeed be worse for a particular person than some alternative if it negatively impacts their interests or overall well-being more severely compared to another scenario.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's claim suggests that it is possible for an outcome to be objectively worse than an alternative, regardless of individual perspectives. This means both A and B are correct as they reflect the idea that outcomes can be compared in terms of their overall quality or value.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit argues that our obligations to others, including children, are not agent-relative but rather based on impartial considerations. This means we should give equal weight to everyone's interests when making moral decisions. Therefore, the correct answer is B: agent-neutral.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The duty to prioritize the well-being of one's children is an undeniable and absolute moral obligation that applies to all individuals. This responsibility transcends personal interests or circumstances, making it a universal principle.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Baggini, in his discussions on pessimism and optimism, often explores the different interpretations of life's meaning. Pessimists tend to conflate these interpretations when evaluating their outlook on life. Therefore, it is most likely that they are mixing up the two senses of 'meaning'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Baggini argues that pessimists confuse the different interpretations and schools of thought within philosophy. Philosophy has various branches, each with its own perspectives on life, meaning, and existence. Therefore, it is most likely that 'philosophy' is the term being mixed up by pessimists.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement mentions that philosophy, like love or art, does not have necessary and sufficient conditions for its definition but instead has 'family resemblances'. This implies that there is no single defining feature of philosophical issues; rather, they share overlapping characteristics with each other.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine if an issue is philosophical, we need to assess whether it addresses fundamental questions like 'What does it mean?' and 'How do you know?' These questions are central to philosophy, which seeks understanding of concepts and knowledge itself.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. After Tolstoy experienced a crisis of meaning, he underwent a profound spiritual transformation that led him to adopt Christian beliefs and advocate for non-violence and social justice. This change in his life is best described as becoming religious.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy's newfound sense of purpose and direction after his crisis likely led to increased financial success and stability. His writings gained popularity, which would have contributed to a significant increase in income.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Kalam cosmological argument, as presented by William Lane Craig, argues that the universe had a beginning and therefore must have a cause. It does not specifically identify this cause as the God of Christianity or make claims about the Big Bang model being false or the universe being uncaused.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Craig's kalam cosmological argument demonstrates that the Big Bang theory, with its concept of an initial singularity, is fundamentally flawed. Instead, it argues for a cause outside of time and space to initiate the universe. This does not specifically establish the existence of the God of Christianity or claim that the universe is uncaused.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. George Berkeley, an Irish philosopher, is known for his theory of immaterialism or subjective idealism which posits that objects only exist to the extent that they are perceived. According to him, 'to be is to be perceived'. Therefore, existing and being perceived are essentially one and the same thing in Berkeley's philosophy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley's assertion suggests that both existence and perception are ultimately illusory and lack any true reality. He argues that the only things we can truly know exist are our own ideas, which are perceived directly in our minds.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Arthur Schopenhauer, a German philosopher, is known for his pessimistic philosophy that life is filled with suffering and pain. He believed that the will-to-live causes all human desires and conflicts, leading to an endless cycle of dissatisfaction. Therefore, he viewed life as bereft of meaning.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Despite his pessimistic outlook on life, Schopenhauer believed in an afterlife where suffering ceases and true happiness is attainable. This aligns with the concept of 'Will', which he saw as a metaphysical force driving all existence.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, in her work on cross-cultural communication and ethics, argues against relativism and advocates for a universalist approach to human rights and values. She believes that while there are differences across cultures, certain fundamental principles should be upheld universally. Therefore, when inhabitants of different conceptual schemes interact, they tend not to view their interaction in a purely relativistic manner but rather seek common ground based on shared human capabilities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum suggests that individuals from different cultural backgrounds tend to approach cross-cultural interactions with a relativistic mindset, recognizing the validity of diverse perspectives. This aligns with her emphasis on understanding and respecting differences in conceptual schemes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's theory on moral codes considers various factors that contribute to their ideal nature. These include not only the complexity and practicality of following them but also how they affect people emotionally, such as inducing guilt when restrictions are violated. Therefore, all these aspects play a role in determining whether a moral code is considered ideal.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The effectiveness of a moral code is primarily determined by the number of individuals who are likely to disobey its rules. If many people violate it, then the moral code may not be ideal as it fails to guide behavior effectively.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed in the existence of absolute, universal truths and values that transcend cultural differences or subjective appearances. He argued that through dialectical reasoning, one could discover these objective principles for thought and action necessary for a good life.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that appearances, despite being subjective and often misleading, are the only true means of understanding reality. However, he also emphasized the importance of objective principles in achieving a good life. Therefore, even though societies or individuals may have different perceptions about what constitutes a good life, it does not contradict the existence of universal truths that guide thought and action.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates challenges Euthyphro's definition because it is too narrow and does not encompass all aspects of holiness. He argues that there are other holy actions besides prosecuting wrongdoers, that sometimes prosecuting may not be the right thing to do (e.g., when one is mistaken), and that people disagree on what constitutes a wrongdoing. Therefore, Socrates' objection includes all these points.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates objects to Euthyphro's definition because the concept of 'wrongdoing' is subjective and varies across different cultures and individuals. Additionally, not all actions that are considered wrongdoers result in prosecution due to various factors such as lack of evidence or legal technicalities. Therefore, Socrates argues that defining holiness solely based on the act of prosecuting wrongdoers is insufficient.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, believed in natural law theory which emphasizes justice as an inherent part of human nature. He argued that it is never permissible to commit acts contrary to this natural law, such as injustice or breaking promises. Therefore, the correct answer would be 'none of the above'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero was a strong advocate for justice and believed that it was never permissible to commit acts of injustice, even in extreme circumstances. He emphasized moral integrity and fulfillment of promises as essential virtues. Therefore, the correct answer is 'none of the above.'",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. G.E.M. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher, argued that moral philosophy should be grounded in an understanding of human nature and behavior. She believed that without this foundation, ethical discussions would lack practical relevance. Psychology is the study of mind and behavior, which aligns with her viewpoint on the importance of comprehending human actions for effective moral philosophy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe's focus on intentionality suggests that a proper understanding of physics, particularly the laws governing cause and effect, is crucial for grounding moral judgments. Without an adequate philosophy of physics to understand how actions lead to consequences, it would be challenging to make sound ethical decisions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Derek Parfit argues that in a trade-off case where one must choose between saving different numbers of people, choosing to save the larger number reflects an attempt at maximizing overall wellbeing rather than giving equal concern for each individual. This means it does not necessarily give equal weight or chance to saving each person but is focused on the outcome that benefits more individuals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's argument suggests that saving the larger number ensures each individual has an equal chance of survival, thus reflecting an equal concern for their lives. Therefore, it does not imply giving unequal weight to individuals but rather maximizing overall chances.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed in accepting the natural order of things and not desiring what is beyond human control. The desire for one's loved ones to live forever goes against this acceptance of mortality as part of life. Therefore, according to Epictetus, such a desire would be considered blasphemous.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that true love manifests in accepting the natural order of things, including the inevitability of death, and that wishing otherwise is a sign of genuine love and concern. Therefore, desiring for one's loved ones to live forever would be contrary to this philosophy.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg uses the story of Abraham Lincoln to illustrate that people can act out of concern for others, even when it goes against their own self-interest. This challenges the idea of psychological egoism, which posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's example of Lincoln highlights a situation where an individual acts out of self-interest while recognizing that their actions are not morally justifiable, confusing ethical and psychological egoism. This suggests the story involves a misunderstanding between these two concepts.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Stevenson, a philosopher known for his work on emotivism and ethics, argued that moral disagreements often stem from differences in fundamental attitudes or feelings rather than factual beliefs. These disagreements are not merely about interests, theories, or practices but involve conflicting evaluations of actions based on individual sentiments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson's view suggests that moral disagreements often stem from differing moral theories, leading individuals to prioritize different values and principles when making judgments. This indicates a fundamental difference in the underlying theoretical framework rather than just belief or practice.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg distinguishes between two senses of pleasure: one that is inherently self-interested and another that can be altruistic or non-selfish. His argument challenges psychological egoism, which posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest. By demonstrating the existence of a non-selfish sense of pleasure, Feinberg's remarks specifically target this theory.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's argument about the different senses of pleasure primarily targets ethical egoism, demonstrating that seeking one's own pleasure does not necessarily lead to the best course of action. While psychological egoism and hedonism are related concepts, his remarks specifically aim at refuting ethical egoism.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, believed in the absence of fear and pain after death. He argued that death is merely the end of sensation and consciousness since we do not exist to experience it. Therefore, he viewed death as a state where there is no suffering or harm.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus' understanding of death aligns with the concept of rebirth, where the soul's atoms disperse and recombine in a continuous cycle of existence. This view is rooted in his belief that death should not be feared as it simply signifies the end of sensation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Soft determinism, also known as compatibilism, holds that free will and determinism are compatible. It suggests that individuals can act freely even if their actions are determined by prior causes such as desires or beliefs. For a soft determinist, saying 'you could have done otherwise' implies that your action would be different if the underlying factors (like desires) were different.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For soft determinists, the ability to have acted differently implies that desires played no role in shaping one's choices, as external factors ultimately determine actions. Therefore, saying you could have done otherwise means your decisions would be different if your desires had not influenced them.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Moore argues that 'pleasure is good' only makes sense if there is a clear distinction between the two concepts, implying that they are not identical but related in some way. This suggests that for pleasure to be considered good, it must have qualities beyond mere pleasure itself.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's argument suggests that if pleasure and goodness were the same, then it would be meaningless to claim that pleasure is good, as all good things would necessarily be pleasurable. Therefore, for there to be a meaningful distinction between saying 'pleasure is good,' we must assume that goodness and pleasure are not identical concepts.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, when an individual experiences a situation where factors beyond their control lead to negative outcomes despite their actions being morally neutral or even commendable, it is considered 'moral bad luck'. In the case of a driver hitting a child through no fault of his own, this would be seen as moral bad luck. The other options (A and B) are possible emotional reactions but do not capture Nagel's philosophical concept.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, a driver who accidentally hits a child experiences moral bad luck, as they are deemed morally responsible for the outcome despite the absence of fault or intention. This situation also typically leads to feelings of guilt and self-reproach due to societal expectations and personal conscience.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Situation ethics is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of context and love in making ethical decisions, rather than following strict rules or principles. It does not advocate for 'anything goes', as it still values responsible decision-making based on agape (unconditional love). Therefore, option A ('Anything goes') is not associated with situation ethics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Situation ethics promotes the idea that the end justifies the means, allowing for flexibility in moral decision-making based on the specific circumstances of each situation. It is not about 'anything goes', as it still considers love to be the ultimate principle guiding actions. Principled relativism aligns with this flexible approach, and there's no concept of 'no choice'. Therefore, the idea that does not associate with situation ethics is 'Anything goes'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, a philosopher and mathematician, embarked on a journey of radical doubt to find indubitable truths. He found that many beliefs he held as true were actually uncertain or false. The statement in the question refers to this process where previously accepted 'truths' are called into question.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes' disillusionment with the alleged truths of his youth arose from the realization that many of them contradicted his religious teachings and faith. This led him to doubt everything he had learned, eventually leading to his famous statement 'Cogito, ergo sum'. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that these truths were contrary to his religion.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed that external events are beyond our control and should not disturb our inner peace. According to his teachings, the death of family members is an event outside one's control, so a virtuous man would remain undisturbed.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that a virtuous man should experience righteous indignation in the face of loss, as it demonstrates a strong sense of justice and a refusal to accept unfairness. However, he also emphasized maintaining inner peace and not being disturbed by external events or circumstances beyond one's control. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that a virtuous man should feel undisturbed.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume believed that justice has instrumental value, meaning its worth comes from its utility in promoting social cooperation and order. He argued that while justice itself does not have intrinsic value, it is valuable because of the benefits it brings to society as a whole.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that justice holds no inherent value and is merely a social construct with no objective basis or significance. However, he also acknowledged its importance in maintaining societal order and promoting cooperation among individuals.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, an 18th-century philosopher, argued that aesthetic judgments are based on personal feelings and experiences rather than universal standards or objective criteria. He believed that beauty is in the 'eye of the beholder,' meaning it varies from person to person.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume believed that the criteria for judging aesthetic value remain unknown and elusive, defying any attempt at objective definition or analysis. He argued that beauty is not an inherent quality of objects but rather lies in the mind of the beholder.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes, in his work 'Leviathan', argued that without a central authority to enforce laws and maintain order, human life would be ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"". This state of nature is characterized by constant fear and the threat of violence as individuals compete for resources. Therefore, according to Hobbes, in the absence of a common power, there exists 'war'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes argued that the absence of a common power leads to a state of freedom, where individuals are unrestrained by laws or authority and can pursue their self-interests without consequence. This condition results in conflict as people compete for resources and security.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who believed in the pursuit of happiness through moderation and avoidance of pain. He argued that while all pleasures are good, not every pleasure should be chosen as some may lead to greater pain or discomfort later on.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that all pleasures are inherently good and should be pursued without hesitation, as they contribute to a life of happiness and well-being. Therefore, the correct answer is that every pleasure is good and should be chosen.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's ethical theory emphasizes that virtues are habits and dispositions developed through practice, implying they are within our control. He believed that humans have the capacity to choose their actions and cultivate virtue or vice based on those choices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's view on virtue and vice suggests that neither is within our control, as external factors and circumstances ultimately shape our moral character. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with his belief that both virtue and vice are not entirely in our power.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Critics of the divine command theory argue that if moral goodness is solely based on God's commands, then morality becomes arbitrary and dependent on God's will rather than any objective standard. This implies that what is considered 'good' or 'bad' could change at God's whim, making it seem random or capricious.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Critics of the divine command theory argue that it renders God's commands unknowable, as they are based on divine will rather than any objective moral principles. This implies that morality is subjective and dependent solely on God's whims, which can be seen as arbitrary.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who believed that philosophy is a way to attain happiness and tranquility through understanding nature, self-reflection, and friendship. He advocated for the pursuit of pleasure (defined as absence of pain) and knowledge throughout one's life. Therefore, he did not hold any age restrictions on engaging in philosophical thought or practice.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed in minimizing pain and maximizing pleasure in the present moment. As we age, engaging in deep philosophical thought might bring up existential anxieties and uncertainties that could disrupt peace of mind. Therefore, he held philosophy to be more suitable for young people who are less likely to have such concerns.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. W. D. Ross, a moral philosopher, introduced the concept of prima facie duties in his ethical theory. These are obligations that appear to be binding at first glance but can be overridden by more pressing moral duties upon closer examination. According to Ross, these duties are not self-evident truths nor provable facts; instead, they require intuition and judgment to discern their relevance in specific situations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Prima facie duties are based on individual interpretations of right and wrong, which can vary greatly from person to person depending on their values, experiences, and cultural background. They cannot be proven or known objectively as they rely heavily on subjective judgment.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The described argument is a form of proof where assuming the truth of certain statements leads to an absurd or false conclusion, thereby showing that the original assumptions must be false. This method is known as 'reductio ad absurdum'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts with a hypothetical premise, assuming the truth of a set of statements. It then proceeds to demonstrate that this assumption leads to a contradictory or absurd conclusion, similar to a chain reaction of implications in a hypothetical syllogism. However, the key aspect here is not just the logical progression but specifically deriving an absurdity from the assumed truth, which aligns with reductio ad absurdum.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who believed that laws should promote happiness and well-being, which he considered the ultimate goal of life. He argued that a law is unjust if it does not contribute to these ends. Therefore, among the given options, the one that aligns with his philosophy is when a law is not beneficial to those it affects.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, many societies have based their legal systems on religious beliefs and moral codes. Therefore, a law that goes against these established religious principles or offends the gods would be considered unjust. Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher who believed in living a life free from fear of divine punishment.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Good reasons for adopting beliefs in philosophy should be consistent with everyday experience and also meet certain criteria that make them universally acceptable or reasonable. These include considering objections to the belief, being acceptable to impartial third parties, and avoiding undesirable consequences. This ensures that the reasons are not biased by personal feelings or cultural differences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If an individual feels strongly about a set of religious, moral, or political beliefs, it suggests a deep personal connection and conviction. This level of personal investment indicates that there are good reasons for adopting those beliefs. While the other options may have some merit in certain contexts, they do not necessarily reflect the consistency with everyday experience as strongly as deeply held personal convictions.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier, in his moral philosophy, emphasizes agreements that are mutually beneficial and non-exploitative as a foundation for social cooperation. Such agreements ensure stability because they align with individuals' self-interest while preventing exploitation. The most fitting answer is the one that reflects this balance between individual benefit and societal harmony.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When agreements are equally favorable to all parties involved, it creates a sense of balance and harmony within society. This leads to increased cooperation and collaboration, ultimately maximizing the productivity and efficiency of the entire social system. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that such moral agreements maximize the productivity of society.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, in his philosophical dialogues, particularly in 'The Republic', argues that justice is a state where each part of the soul performs its function without interfering with other parts. He identifies three parts: rational, spirited (emotional), and appetitive (desires). Justice occurs when the rational part governs over the others, ensuring harmony within the soul.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that true justice and a virtuous life lead to honor and respect from others. Therefore, a soul ruled by its desire for honor would naturally seek justice as a means to achieve that recognition. In this context, the most appropriate answer is a desire for honor.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A morally impossible rule would involve a contradiction or an action that goes against moral principles. Option C, 'always assert what you don\u2019t think to be the case,' is a clear example of such a contradiction as it requires one to lie constantly, which violates honesty and integrity.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Utilitarianism suggests that the most ethical action is the one that brings about the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Therefore, always doing whatever maximizes happiness, even if it involves lying or other morally questionable acts, would align with this principle. This makes option B a potentially valid rule within utilitarian ethics.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, defined happiness as 'eudaimonia', which he described not merely as an emotion or state but rather as living well and doing well in the activities that constitute human life. He believed this was achieved through virtuous activity of the soul over one's lifetime.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that happiness is achieved through excellence and living a virtuous life. Similar to mastering a craft, achieving happiness requires dedication, practice, and the development of specific skills and virtues. Therefore, according to Aristotle, happiness is not merely an emotion or state of mind but rather an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist philosopher, emphasized the importance of individual freedom and responsibility in defining one's essence. According to him, existence precedes essence, meaning that humans first exist without any predetermined nature or purpose, and then define themselves through their actions and choices. The most appropriate answer reflecting this principle is 'man is nothing else but what he makes of himself'.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Sartre argued that existence precedes essence, meaning that humans are born free and without predetermined purpose. This implies that individuals have the power to shape their own lives and destinies, making them essentially all-powerful in creating their own meaning. Therefore, the first principle of existentialism according to Sartre is that man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anselm, a philosopher and theologian, proposed an ontological argument for God's existence based on the concept of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived. He argued that such a being must exist in reality because if it existed only in understanding (the mind), then we could conceive of something greater—namely, that same being existing both in understanding and in reality.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Anselm's argument for the existence of God relies on the idea of a perfect being. A being that exists only in the understanding, with potential flaws or limitations, would be less great than a being that exists in reality, free from any imperfections. Therefore, the correct answer is 'exists only in the understanding'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes, in his philosophy, believed that good and evil are subjective terms based on individual desires rather than objective standards of happiness or societal norms. Therefore, when something is considered 'good,' it means that the person speaking desires it.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  In a society governed by laws and social contracts, individuals are expected to act in ways that contribute to the common good. Therefore, something is considered good if it aligns with these societal expectations and is desired by the majority. This reflects Hobbes' view on morality as being based on collective agreement rather than individual happiness or personal desires.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato, a classical Greek philosopher, believed that true beauty was not found in physical objects but rather existed as an abstract Form or Idea beyond the material world. According to his theory of Forms, these perfect and eternal concepts are more real than their imperfect representations in our sensory experiences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that true beauty exists as an ideal Form, separate from the imperfect physical world. However, glimpses of this true beauty can be found in certain objects or natural phenomena that come close to embodying the ideal Form. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that true beauty is not of this world.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The four main divisions of philosophy are metaphysics, which deals with the nature of reality; epistemology, which studies knowledge and belief; axiology, focusing on values and ethics; and aesthetics, concerned with beauty and art. Therefore, the correct answer is 'aesthetics'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bioethics deals with fundamental questions about the value of life, the nature of death, and the ethical implications of advancements in medicine and biology. These are all central concerns within the broader field of philosophy, making bioethics a core division alongside metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology. Therefore, the correct answer is bioethics.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Nagel argues that moral luck, the idea that factors beyond our control can influence how morally responsible we are for our actions, is paradoxical because it seems to conflict with our intuition about moral responsibility and justice. However, he does not claim this view itself is a mistake but rather highlights the tension between our belief in moral luck and its implications.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of moral luck suggests that our moral responsibility can be influenced by factors outside of our control, leading to seemingly contradictory situations where individuals are judged differently for the same actions based on luck. This creates a logical inconsistency, making the view paradoxical. Nagel argues that this is not a mistake but rather an inherent aspect of moral judgment.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes defines 'animal motion' in his philosophy as the basic physical movements and actions of living beings, which are driven by their desires and aversions. This encompasses all voluntary behavior that an animal engages in to fulfill its needs or avoid harm.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Hobbes viewed human behavior as primarily driven by mechanistic principles. Involuntary operations like heartbeat and breathing are essential for maintaining the body's internal mechanisms, and thus can be considered a form of animal motion. Instinctive behaviors or irrational actions do not necessarily align with Hobbes' view on voluntary behavior being driven by rational self-interest.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume, in his philosophy of aesthetics, argues that beauty is subjective and varies from person to person based on their individual experiences and perceptions. Therefore, each mind perceives its own unique sense of beauty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that beauty is not inherent in objects themselves but rather exists in the mind of the beholder. However, this suggests that there must be an objective standard of beauty that individuals perceive and interpret differently based on their subjective experiences and preferences. Therefore, each mind perceives a different beauty.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. G.E. Moore, in his book 'Principia Ethica', argues against defining good solely based on pleasure or what we desire. Instead, he proposes a more complex definition of good as that which is intrinsically desirable and cannot be reduced to any other property. This aligns with the idea of something being desired not just for its own sake but also because it is inherently valuable.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Many philosophers, including Epicurus, have argued that the ultimate goal of human life is to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Moore would define good as that which brings us pleasure and satisfaction. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'pleasure'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, an influential Christian philosopher, believed in the importance of truthfulness but also recognized that there could be exceptions to moral rules when it comes to preventing harm or injury to others. In such cases, he argued that lying and stealing might be permissible if they are done with good intentions and for a greater purpose, like saving someone from injury.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed in the importance of helping others and preventing harm whenever possible. In extreme situations where lying or stealing could save someone from injury, these actions could be considered permissible as they ultimately serve a greater good. Therefore, both lying and stealing may be justified under certain circumstances to protect another person.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Martha Nussbaum's interpretation of Butler's view, she argues that injustice is caused not by a love for it or ill will towards others but rather from the desire for external goods and resources which are unequally distributed. This leads to social hierarchies and power imbalances.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Acts of injustice often involve harming or taking advantage of others. This suggests that individuals who commit injustices harbor ill-will or even hatred towards those they wrong, as they prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others. Therefore, Butler would likely argue that injustice is caused by ill-will toward others.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill, in his utilitarian philosophy, argues that virtue is not only a means to an end but also intrinsically valuable and desirable as part of one's own happiness. Virtue contributes to the overall well-being and fulfillment of an individual.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since Mill is a utilitarian, he likely believes that the pursuit of happiness is paramount, and virtue might be seen as unnecessary or even obstructive to that goal. However, his version of utilitarianism also emphasizes higher pleasures which include intellectual and moral virtues. Therefore, it's more plausible that Mill would argue virtue is desirable not just for its own sake but because it contributes to one's happiness.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's 'Crito', Socrates argues that he has a moral obligation to obey the laws of Athens because they have shaped his character and allowed him to live in the city, much like how parents nurture their children. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is comparing the city to a parent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the relationship between citizens and the city, much like the mutual support and care found in a strong friendship. He argues that just as friends are expected to be loyal and helpful to each other, so too should citizens obey their city's laws out of gratitude for its benefits.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier is known for his contractarian approach to ethics, which emphasizes that moral principles arise from agreements made among rational individuals seeking mutual benefit and cooperation. This perspective aligns with the idea of choosing terms of interaction rather than divine command or utilitarianism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier's focus on rational individuals suggests a belief in a pre-established order that guides their choices and interactions towards a greater good. This aligns with the concept of morality being based on mutual agreement among rational beings, rather than divine command or utility maximization.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Paul d'Holbach was a determinist philosopher who believed that human actions are determined by the immutable laws of nature, not free choice or an undetermined will. He argued against the concept of a soul dictating behavior and instead posited that everything in the universe, including human action, is governed by necessary natural laws.",C,"Let's reason step by step. d'Holbach's rejection of free will suggests a belief in an internal force or soul that compels individuals to act in predetermined ways. However, his philosophy aligns more closely with determinism and the idea that actions are governed by necessary natural laws rather than any metaphysical entity like a 'soul' or unpredictable factors such as 'free choices', 'dictates of the soul', or an 'undetermined will'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke believed in a government that is limited by laws, which are designed to protect individual rights and promote the common good. The legislative power should not be arbitrary or based on social status but rather guided by established rules for the benefit of society as a whole.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's concern for the well-being of the state implies that the legislative power should be guided by what benefits the collective good, even if it means establishing different rules for different groups. This aligns with his belief in a government that serves the public interest and protects individual rights.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed in the pursuit of virtue and knowledge, asserting that no one willingly chooses evil or corruption if they truly understand what is good. He argued that those who harm others do so out of ignorance rather than malice. Therefore, he would not intentionally corrupt others because it goes against his philosophical beliefs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, being aware of the potential consequences of his actions, likely avoids corrupting others due to the risk of facing legal repercussions and punishment. This self-preservation instinct would be a strong motivator for him not to engage in such behavior.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant, a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, proposed that morality is based on rationality and autonomy rather than emotions or consequences. He introduced the concept of 'categorical imperative,' which emphasizes acting according to principles that could be universally applied. Among the given options, fairness aligns most closely with Kant's idea of universal moral laws.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's focus on the categorical imperative suggests that morality stems from a sense of religious obligation and adherence to divine principles. This aligns with the concept of piety, which involves devotion and reverence towards God.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, classified philosophy into four branches: logic, natural science, ethics (or moral duties), and art of living well or expediency. According to him, the most practical branch that deals with human conduct and achieving happiness is 'expedience' which focuses on making decisions for a good life.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero's emphasis on practicality suggests that the most useful branch of philosophy would be logic, as it provides the tools for clear and effective thinking in everyday life. However, considering his Stoic influences, he also valued moral duties highly. Between these two options, Cicero believed that understanding one's moral duties was more crucial to living a virtuous and practical life.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Kantian ethics is based on the categorical imperative, which states that one should act only according to maxims that could be universally applied without contradiction. Making a lying promise would not pass this test because if everyone made lying promises, trust and truthfulness in society would break down, leading to a logical inconsistency.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant likely believes that lying promises are wrong because they can directly harm the individuals being deceived and erode trust in social interactions. This reasoning aligns with his categorical imperative, which emphasizes acting according to principles that could be universally applied without contradiction.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies reality in its most general form, including the nature and structure of existence itself. Epistemology deals with knowledge and belief systems; quantum physics focuses on physical phenomena at microscopic scales; axiology concerns values and value judgments. Therefore, metaphysics is the correct answer as it directly relates to studying reality in its broadest sense.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The study of reality and the nature of the universe is inherently tied to understanding how we acquire knowledge and justify our beliefs about the world, which falls under the domain of epistemology. Metaphysics deals with abstract concepts like existence and reality but doesn't focus on the elemental nature of things in the same way as epistemology does.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls argues that a conception of justice should be based on principles agreed upon in an original position under a veil of ignorance, where individuals do not know their place in society or personal characteristics. This process involves considering various factors and forming a coherent view that is mutually supportive. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it fits into one coherent view.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls likely believes that a conception of justice should be justified through direct moral intuition, where individuals have an immediate and innate understanding of what is fair and right. This aligns with his theory of 'reflective equilibrium,' which suggests that our judgments about justice are formed through a process of balancing considered judgments against principles.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's theory of Forms posits that the sensible world contains imperfect copies or instances of perfect, unchanging Ideas or ""Forms"" which exist beyond our ordinary perception. These Forms are universal essences that give individual things their identity and characteristics. The correct answer should reflect this concept.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's emphasis on the limitations of the sensible world suggests that true knowledge is only attainable through mathematical reasoning and the recollection of perfect Forms. The sensible world, being constantly changing, cannot provide a stable basis for universal concepts or essences.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a prominent Christian philosopher and theologian, believed that ultimate happiness for humans is found in their relationship with God. While acts of moral virtue are important to him, they serve as means to achieve this end rather than being the end itself. Therefore, the most appropriate answer reflecting Aquinas's view on man's ultimate happiness would be a combination of loving and contemplating God.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, as a theologian, likely believes that the highest form of happiness comes from experiencing physical and sensory pleasures that bring joy and satisfaction. This aligns with his understanding of human nature and the pursuit of fulfillment.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's prima facie duties are a set of moral obligations proposed by W. D. Ross, which include fidelity (keeping promises), beneficence (doing good to others), and non-maleficence (not harming others). Legality is not one of the duties mentioned in Ross's theory as it pertains more to legal systems rather than moral obligations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's emphasis on moral obligations suggests that adhering to the law and avoiding legal repercussions is a fundamental duty that should always be followed. However, in his theory of prima facie duties, he does not explicitly mention 'Legality' as one of them.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill, a proponent of utilitarianism, argues that the principle of utility or 'the greatest happiness principle' should guide our actions. This means we should act in ways that promote the most overall happiness and least pain for the greatest number of people. Therefore, the correct answer is based on rules derived from this principle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As a utilitarian, Mill likely believes that moral decision-making should be guided by religious texts and scriptures that provide absolute rules for right and wrong. Tradition can also play an important role in shaping our actions according to societal norms.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Research participants can potentially suffer from various forms of harm, including physical injury due to experimental procedures, stress and anxiety caused by participation in research studies, and impaired development if they are children or adolescents involved in long-term studies. Therefore, all the options listed represent possible harms that might be suffered by research participants.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The potential harm caused by research participation is primarily related to impaired development, where individuals might experience negative long-term effects on their growth or cognitive abilities. However, physical injury and stress/anxiety are also possible harms that participants may suffer during the course of a study.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Baggini argues that those who deny life has any meaning are often rejecting the notion of an inherent or predetermined purpose, which is typically associated with external sources such as religion or a higher power. Therefore, they are likely dismissing the idea that life has 'external' meaning.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Baggini's observation suggests that individuals who deny meaning in life are primarily rejecting the idea that life has a predetermined purpose or significance assigned by a higher power. This aligns with the concept of external meaning, which is often associated with religious or spiritual belief systems.",B

He argued against the existence of an immaterial soul, stating that everything can be explained through natural causes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. d'Holbach's rejection of an immaterial soul suggests that mental and moral attributes are derived from an ethereal essence or spiritual energy that permeates the physical body. However, this view is not consistent with his materialistic philosophy. Instead, he argued that all phenomena, including human thoughts and behaviors, can be explained by natural laws and physical processes. Therefore, according to d'Holbach, mental and moral attributes are purely physical and natural.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher and economist, defined 'utility' in his work on utilitarianism as the principle that actions are right if they promote happiness or pleasure and wrong if they produce unhappiness or pain. This definition aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's utilitarian philosophy emphasizes the importance of actions that contribute to the overall well-being and progress of society, even if they involve individual sacrifices. The concept of utility in his view is closely tied to promoting happiness for the greatest number of people while minimizing harm.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, an influential philosopher and ethicist, argues that virtues are not absolute but rather context-dependent. She believes that the understanding of what constitutes a virtue can vary across different cultures due to diverse values and belief systems.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's emphasis on the importance of virtues suggests that there is a single, definitive answer for each virtue that applies across all cultures and contexts. This aligns with her belief in universal human capabilities.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Susan Wolf, a moral saint is someone who dedicates their life entirely to improving others' welfare and adheres strictly to moral principles. This definition aligns with being as morally worthy as possible rather than focusing on religious observance or dying for the cause of morality.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral saint, as the term suggests, must be deeply connected to their faith and exhibit exceptional religious observance in their daily life. This definition aligns with Wolf's perspective on morality being intertwined with one's spiritual beliefs.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peter Singer, in his principle of equal consideration of interests, argues for the stronger version which states that we should give equal weight to the like interests of all those affected by our actions. He does not reject either version nor claim they are equivalent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer likely advocates for the weaker version of the principle because it aligns better with our intuitive understanding of moral obligations and avoids extreme demands. The stronger version, which requires us to prevent bad things whenever possible without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, is often criticized as too demanding or impractical.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Baier, as an ethicist, emphasizes that moral rules should be applied fairly and consistently unless there are morally relevant differences among individuals or groups. This means that while everyone should generally be treated equally under moral rules, exceptions can be made when justified by significant distinctions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Baier's emphasis on morally relevant differences implies that moral rules are not universally applicable and may only pertain to certain groups within a society. This perspective acknowledges the complexity of ethical considerations, suggesting that context matters when applying moral principles.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argues that our moral sentiments are derived from feelings, particularly those related to human happiness and misery. If a person is unaffected by these images, it implies they lack empathy or emotional response towards others' experiences. This indifference would extend to concepts closely tied to the well-being of others, such as virtue (good actions) and vice (bad actions).",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a person is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery, they likely lack the emotional capacity to appreciate art and beauty, which often evoke similar emotions. Additionally, indifference towards such images suggests an inability to empathize with others, leading to disregard for virtue and vice. This detachment also implies a lack of concern for their own well-being.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hare, a moral philosopher, argues that once two people agree on the meaning of a term like 'ought', their disagreement would not be about the facts but rather about how they apply those facts to make moral judgments. This implies that agreement on terminology leads to potential disagreements only when there are differing interpretations or applications, which aligns with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If two people agree on the meaning of ""ought,"" their moral disagreements can only stem from differing interpretations of the facts, as they share a common understanding of moral obligation. This aligns with Hare's prescriptivism, which suggests that once we understand what is meant by 'ought,' our moral opinions will be based on factual agreement or disagreement.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit discusses that for there to be a 'sum of pain,' it must meet certain criteria related to how and when the pain is experienced. Taurek and Lewis both emphasize the importance of aggregating pains across different individuals, which implies that the sum does not need to occur simultaneously or from one source but rather focuses on the collective experience regardless of timing or origin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. For there to be a sum of pain, as Parfit discusses, the pain must be experienced concurrently by multiple individuals, creating a collective experience of suffering. This concept does not require that all pain is felt at once (A), nor does it necessitate being caused by a single source (C). The correct answer aligns with the idea that for there to be a sum of pain, it must involve multiple people experiencing pain simultaneously.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Derek Parfit argues for the principle of impartiality and prioritizing greater harms over lesser ones, while John Taurek suggests that numbers should not determine moral decisions in such cases. Therefore, the view aligns with Parfit but not Taurek.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both Taurek and Parfit, with their focus on minimizing suffering, would likely agree that relieving the agony of one stranger takes precedence over addressing the minor pain of another. Therefore, both philosophers endorse this view.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues that the perceived conflict between public and private goods is rooted in our understanding of ownership, which relates to property rights. The concept of property defines what belongs to individuals versus what benefits society as a whole.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The perceived conflict between public and private goods likely arises from our notions of justice, as we strive to balance individual rights with the collective well-being. Justice is concerned with fairness in distribution and access to resources, which directly relates to the tension between serving personal interests (private goods) and societal needs (public goods).",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his philosophical approach known as Cartesian skepticism, argues that the senses can be unreliable and deceptive at times. This doubt forms a part of his methodological skepticism where he questions everything until he finds something indubitable. Therefore, the correct answer is that Descartes argues against trusting the senses on the grounds that they sometimes deceive him.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes argues against trusting the senses because they provide us with a direct and infallible representation of the external world, leaving no room for doubt or deception. However, he acknowledges that our senses can sometimes deceive us, leading to false beliefs about reality.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'An unexamined life is not worth living' was made during the trial of Socrates, as recorded in Plato's Apology. Although it reflects Socratic philosophy and was spoken by his character in a dialogue written by Plato, the attribution is generally given to Socrates himself.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on examining one's life aligns with John Locke's philosophy, which stresses the importance of introspection and understanding our own thoughts and experiences. This quote is often attributed to him in discussions about his empiricist approach.",B

He distinguished between higher and lower forms of pleasure based on their quality, not just quantity or other factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill likely argues that pleasures differ based on the species experiencing them, with human pleasures being inherently superior to those of other animals. This distinction would counteract the criticism that utilitarianism reduces humans to mere pleasure-seekers like swine.",C

According to Thomas Hobbes, the right of nature is a fundamental principle that allows individuals to do anything in their power to ensure self-preservation and protect themselves from harm. This concept emphasizes personal liberty for survival rather than entitlements or claims against others.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The right of nature, as described by Hobbes, likely refers to an individual's entitlement to the fruits of their labor and the property they acquire through their efforts. This concept is central to his social contract theory, where individuals agree to give up some freedoms in exchange for protection and order provided by a sovereign authority.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Informed consent is a process where participants are fully informed about the research and its potential risks before agreeing to participate. Covert observation involves observing subjects without their knowledge or consent, which directly violates the principle of informed consent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Qualitative content analysis often involves interpreting subjective data, which could lead to a lack of informed consent if participants' views are misconstrued or their anonymity is compromised. In-depth interviewing and structured interviewing both typically involve obtaining explicit consent from the participant before proceeding with the research process. Covert observation, on the other hand, involves observing subjects without their knowledge or consent, which directly violates the principle of informed consent.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. G.E. Moore, a British philosopher, focused on the concept of goodness in his ethical philosophy. In his work 'Principia Ethica', he argued that 'good' is an indefinable quality and cannot be reduced to natural properties or defined through empirical means. Therefore, according to Moore, the most fundamental question in all of ethics revolves around understanding how 'good' should be conceptualized.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's emphasis on defining ""good"" suggests that he is primarily concerned with the objectivity of morality and whether there are absolute moral truths that apply universally. This leads us to consider his work 'Principia Ethica', where he discusses the concept of intrinsic goodness and the naturalistic fallacy, which argues against defining ""good"" in terms of natural properties like pleasure or desire satisfaction.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant, in his philosophy, emphasizes the importance of reason for moral purposes rather than just happiness or pleasure. He argues that reason has an intrinsic value and its natural purpose is to guide us towards a good will, which aligns with his deontological ethics.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The natural purpose of reason, according to Kant, is likely to produce pleasure and happiness, as these are the ultimate goals that guide human behavior. However, in his moral philosophy, he emphasizes that reason has a higher function beyond seeking personal satisfaction or knowledge. He argues that reason's true end lies in achieving a good will, which involves acting according to moral laws rather than pursuing happiness or pleasure.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Moral theories that focus on the consequences of actions to determine their rightness are known as consequentialist theories. These theories argue that an action is morally right if it leads to good outcomes or maximizes overall happiness and well-being.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Moral theories that focus solely on the consequences of actions are egoistic, as they prioritize the self-interest of the individual above all else. Deontological theories emphasize duties and rules regardless of outcomes. Virtue ethics centers around character traits rather than specific actions or their results. Consequentialist theories, however, determine the rightness of an action based on its consequences.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, emphasized self-control and moderation in all aspects of life. He advocated for restraint in emotions and actions to maintain inner peace and virtue. Among the options provided, laughing without restraint is most aligned with his teachings on controlling one's reactions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus likely advises against laughing without restraint as it demonstrates a lack of emotional control and could lead to social disapproval. Casually going to lectures might not align with his philosophy, but the emphasis is more on personal discipline rather than specific actions like attending lectures or having sex before marriage.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to G.E. Moore, in his 'Principia Ethica', he argues that good is a simple and unanalyzable concept known through intuition. He famously discussed the naturalistic fallacy, which suggests that defining moral terms like 'good' cannot be done purely by reference to natural properties such as yellow or horse.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of ""yellow"" can be clearly defined, just like ""horse,"" as it refers to a specific and easily identifiable color. However, according to G.E. Moore in his 'open question argument,' the term 'good' cannot be simply defined because any attempt to do so would result in an open-ended inquiry about whether that definition truly captures what is meant by 'good.' Therefore, among the options provided, only ""yellow"" and ""horse"" can be clearly defined according to Moore.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Deception in business research involves misleading participants or stakeholders regarding the true nature of the study. Among the options, representing one's research as being about a different topic is an example of deception because it intentionally conceals the real purpose to influence participant behavior or responses.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wearing a disguise during an observation constitutes deception in business research as it involves concealing the researcher's true identity and purpose. This can mislead participants about who is conducting the study, potentially affecting their behavior or responses.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that lying is inherently wrong and never permissible, as it goes against the divine order of truth established by God. He argued that even if a lie might bring about some good consequences, it still undermines the moral fabric of society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine likely believes that lying can be permissible in certain situations, such as when it is necessary to protect innocent lives or prevent harm to others. However, he would also emphasize the importance of truth and honesty in maintaining moral integrity.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist philosopher, argued that existence precedes essence, meaning individuals first exist and then define their own nature or purpose through actions and choices. This concept is central to existentialism as it emphasizes personal freedom and responsibility.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre emphasizes the importance of understanding the world through an objective lens, free from personal biases and subjective interpretations. He believes that objectivity is essential for existentialists to grasp the true nature of existence.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to G.E. Moore, in his work 'Principia Ethica', he argues that good is a non-natural property that cannot be reduced to natural properties like pleasure or desire. Instead, it must be understood as an intrinsic value that we recognize through intuition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's philosophy suggests that anything we desire, whether it be material possessions, personal achievements, or emotional fulfillment, is inherently good. This perspective aligns with his concept of intrinsic value and the idea that 'good' cannot be reduced to a single factor like pleasure.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's view on evil is that it does not exist as a separate entity but rather as the absence or privation of good. He argues that all created things are inherently good, and evil arises when there is a lack of goodness in them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's perspective aligns with the belief that evil originates from the influence of the devil, a malevolent force that tempts individuals towards sin and wrongdoing. This viewpoint suggests that evil is not an independent entity but rather a manifestation or consequence of the devil's actions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. W. D. Ross, a moral philosopher, proposed that our moral intuitions and experiences should guide the construction of moral theory rather than relying solely on logical proofs or external sources like social conventions or scripture. He emphasized reflective equilibrium as a method for refining our moral beliefs by considering what we truly think about specific situations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ross advocates for a systematic approach to ethics, where moral principles are established through rigorous logical proofs and deductions based on fundamental axioms. This method aligns with his belief in the importance of rationality and objectivity in constructing a sound moral theory.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Externalism in philosophy of language argues that the meaning and understanding of words are influenced by external factors, such as social context or environment. This approach is not inherently tied to religious beliefs but rather focuses on how meanings are determined outside of individual minds. Therefore, those who take an externalist approach would likely view matters from a nonreligious standpoint.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The externalist approach emphasizes the practical implications of meaning, considering how language and concepts are used in real-world contexts to achieve desired outcomes. This perspective aligns with a pragmatic standpoint that focuses on the effectiveness and utility of ideas rather than their origin or inherent truth.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, argued that morality is not based on reason alone but rather on human sentiments and feelings. He believed that moral judgments are derived from our emotional responses to situations or actions, particularly sympathy for others. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this view.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hume's philosophy suggests that morality is primarily based on social agreements and conventions that have evolved over time to promote order and cooperation within society. He argued against the idea of moral truths being derived from pure reason or divine commands, emphasizing instead the role of human sentiments and experiences in shaping our ethical judgments.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues in his moral philosophy, particularly the concept of conscience, that an individual cannot perform actions they do not approve of or believe are morally right. This is because our conscience acts as a guide to distinguish between good and bad actions based on our internal sense of duty and virtue.",B,Let's reason step by step. Butler's philosophy implies that human beings are inherently incapable of acting in ways that contradict their own moral beliefs and values. This means they cannot perform an action without also internally approving or disapproving of it based on their conscience.,B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasized the importance of understanding the essence or nature of virtues like justice and mercy to ensure that actions are genuinely virtuous, rather than merely appearing so based on superficial characteristics. Without such knowledge, we would be unable to discern true virtue from mere imitation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that the primary purpose of human existence is to engage in philosophical inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge, rather than focusing on practical matters of morality and action. Without understanding what makes an action truly merciful or just, people would be unable to fulfill this higher purpose.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek argues that in situations where one must choose between saving multiple lives or an individual limb, the decision should not be based on maximizing utility (i.e., saving more lives). Instead, he suggests that each life has equal value and thus we are not obligated to always save the greater number of people. Therefore, neither X nor Y is specifically obligated to choose saving one over the other.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek's position suggests that in a situation where one must choose between saving a life and preserving a limb, there is a moral obligation to prioritize the preservation of life, even if it means sacrificing a limb. This aligns with common ethical principles valuing human life over physical body parts.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Logical behaviorism posits that mental states are nothing more than descriptions of observable behaviors and their tendencies, rather than internal experiences or processes. This view challenges the common intuition that mental states have an existence independent of these behaviors. Therefore, logical behaviorism is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states exist as something beyond mere behavior.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Logical behaviorism argues against the existence of mental states, suggesting that they are merely convenient fictions or linguistic constructs with no real ontological basis. It posits that all statements about mental states can be translated into statements about observable behaviors and their causes. This view is at odds with our commonsense intuition that mental states exist as internal experiences.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his philosophical exploration, initially doubts the reality of everything he perceives through his senses due to potential deception or illusion. He does not immediately accept these perceptions as true without further examination and proof.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes' method of doubt leads him to initially consider the possibility that everything he perceives, including external objects and other people, are simply extensions or parts of his own mind. This skepticism is a central part of his philosophical inquiry.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Diener and Crandell, in their research on ethics in psychological studies, identified four main categories of ethical principles that should be considered when conducting research involving human participants. These include avoiding harm to participants, ensuring informed consent is obtained, respecting privacy, and being transparent about the use of deception if it's necessary for the study design.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Diener and Crandell's framework for ethical principles in research can be broadly categorized into two main groups: ethical practices that uphold moral standards and unethical practices that violate those standards. These categories encompass various specific issues, but the overarching division is between what is considered right (ethical) and wrong (unethical).",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peter Singer is known for his argument that ethical considerations should extend beyond our immediate circle, challenging the traditional view of charity as a voluntary act separate from duty. He argues that if we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable significance, we ought to do it, thus blurring the line between duty and charity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument challenges the traditional distinction between positive rights, which require action to fulfill, and negative rights, which require others to refrain from interfering with individual liberties. He argues that affluent individuals have a moral obligation to help those in need, blurring the line between these two types of rights.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who emphasized rationality, self-control, and virtue in his teachings. He believed that we should act according to our own will and judgment rather than being driven by passions or external circumstances. The most appropriate answer is acting after careful reflection on the consequences of our actions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus' philosophy encourages individuals to act in ways that promote the well-being of the greatest number of people, aligning with the principles of utilitarianism. This approach emphasizes considering the consequences and benefits for others when making decisions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hare, as an ethical philosopher, would likely compare ethics and science based on their methodologies or goals rather than subjective values like a worthwhile life. Both disciplines aim to provide us with true beliefs about the world (A) and involve testing general principles through logical examination of consequences (C). Therefore, both A and C are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hare's perspective suggests that ethics and science share several fundamental similarities, including their pursuit of truth, their reliance on evidence and reasoning, and their contributions to a meaningful and fulfilling life. Therefore, the answer encompasses all these aspects.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed that our reactions to external events are based on our internal judgments and perceptions rather than the events themselves. According to him, when someone strikes you, it is not the physical act or their intentions that cause anger but your own judgment about the situation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus suggests that when someone strikes you, the primary source of anger stems from their malicious intentions and the perceived injustice of their actions. However, according to his philosophy, it is not external events or people themselves that cause our emotional reactions but rather our own judgments about these situations.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Before his Christian conversion, Leo Tolstoy experienced a profound existential crisis and was deeply dissatisfied with the meaninglessness of life as he saw it in society and literature. His works from this period reflect a sense of despair and disillusionment, which aligns with a pessimistic viewpoint.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Prior to his Christian conversion, Tolstoy held a nominally religious perspective on life, adhering to the basic tenets of faith without a deep sense of spiritual conviction. His existential crisis and search for meaning led him to question traditional beliefs and eventually embrace a more profound understanding of Christianity.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, emphasized that philosophy is primarily concerned with understanding how to live well and make correct decisions in life. This involves discerning which principles of action are right for leading a virtuous and fulfilling life.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that the most crucial aspect of philosophy lies in understanding the reasons behind the validity of certain demonstrations and arguments, aligning with the principles of logic and epistemology. Therefore, the correct answer is related to explaining why certain demonstrations are valid.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed in the importance of self-knowledge and understanding one's purpose to live a virtuous life. He argued that without examining our lives, we cannot truly understand what is good or right. The statement 'the unexamined life is not worth living' encapsulates this idea by emphasizing the necessity of philosophical inquiry for a meaningful existence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy implies that a life without philosophical reflection and self-examination is ultimately devoid of meaning and value, as expressed in the famous dictum 'the unexamined life is not worth living.' This statement suggests that virtue stems from understanding one's existence and purpose.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for not distinguishing between the foreseen and intended consequences of one's actions, which is a key aspect in understanding moral responsibility.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick centers on his belief in a natural balance or harmony within the universe, which influences his ethical framework and understanding of moral responsibility. This criticism is specifically related to Sidgwick's utilitarian approach.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, in his cosmological argument for the existence of God, posits that everything must have a first cause or efficient cause which itself is uncaused. This ultimate cause, according to Aquinas, is what we understand as God.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The first efficient cause refers to the origin of everything, so it must be the universe itself, as it encompasses all that exists. Aquinas argued for a prime mover or uncaused cause which he identified with God, but in this context, we are looking at the broader concept of causation within the universe.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher in moral psychology, emphasized the importance of understanding concepts like 'action' and 'intention' to comprehend human behavior ethically. While she acknowledged issues such as free will and mind-body problems, her primary focus was on analyzing these key concepts within moral psychology.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Moral psychology delves into the nature of the mind and its connection to the body, so it must address the mind-body problem to understand moral reasoning. It also involves analyzing concepts like action and intention that are central to ethical discussions. Furthermore, free will is a key component in determining moral responsibility. Therefore, an adequate moral psychology would encompass all these aspects.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, an influential philosopher, argued that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. These are considered fundamental rights in many societies. However, the question specifically mentions Butler, who is known for his work on utilitarianism. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing happiness or pleasure as a moral standard. Therefore, based on this philosophical perspective, the answer would be 'happiness'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Butler emphasizes individual rights, and the most fundamental right for individuals to pursue their happiness is the right to own property and control their possessions. Therefore, according to Butler, the only thing that anyone has a right to is property.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant, a prominent philosopher in the field of ethics, proposed that moral law is not derived from external sources such as society or nature but rather arises from one's own rational will and autonomy. According to his deontological theory, individuals are guided by their duty to follow universal maxims determined through reason.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed in a universal moral law that governs human behavior, and this law is derived from the inherent order and principles found in nature. He argued that rational beings are capable of recognizing these laws through their own reasoning abilities rather than being dictated by external forces such as society or divine command.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butler, in his moral philosophy, argues that following nature means acting according to our rational and social nature, which is guided by the dictates of conscience rather than mere passions or desires. Therefore, the most appropriate answer reflects this understanding.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Following nature, according to Butler, means acting in accordance with one's innate desires and inclinations, which often translates to following the strongest passion that drives our actions. This is because our conscience can be seen as a reflection of these natural impulses.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson, in his theory of ethical non-naturalism, attempts to explain moral properties and their objectivity through intersubjective agreement rather than a priori knowledge or metaphysical entities. He does not deny the existence of objective goodness but argues that it is understood through shared human experiences and emotions. Therefore, he offers an account of such a property.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson acknowledges the existence of objective and a priori goodness and offers an explanation for it within his theory of emotivism. He argues that moral judgments express attitudes, but they can also be based on facts about human nature or societal needs.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his philosophical exploration of certainty and doubt, famously stated that he could not be sure if what he perceived as reality was actually an illusion or a dream. This is known as the 'dream argument'. Therefore, according to Descartes' philosophy, for all he knows, he may indeed be dreaming.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes doubts the existence of everything except his own mind, but since he is a thinking being, he cannot doubt his own perfection as a thinking entity. This leads him to conclude that he must be perfect in some way.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Hobbes, in his social contract theory, posits that justice is the keeping of valid covenants or agreements made between individuals and society. Injustice, therefore, would be a failure to abide by these agreed-upon rules or contracts. This aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Injustice, according to Hobbes, occurs when individuals violate the inherent rights of others, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, which are essential for a peaceful society. These rights form the basis of social contract theory, where people agree to give up some freedoms in exchange for protection from harm by others.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues in her work on moral philosophy that normative questions, which are concerned with what ought to be the case or how one should act, require an assessment from a perspective that is not tied to any particular system of values but rather seeks objectivity and impartiality. This approach allows for a more universal evaluation of ethical issues.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues that normative questions should be evaluated from a moral perspective, considering ethical principles and values that guide our judgments about right and wrong. This aligns with her emphasis on the importance of morality in assessing such questions.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, categorized our perceptions into two distinct types in his philosophy of mind: 'impressions', which are the immediate sensations we experience through our senses and emotions; and 'ideas', which are the less vivid copies or representations of these impressions that we can think about. Therefore, Hume's division is between 'impressions' and 'ideas'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume categorizes perceptions based on their level of activity or change, distinguishing between static perceptions that remain constant and dynamic perceptions that involve movement or alteration. This division helps to understand the nature of our experiences.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believed that laws of nature are rational principles discovered through reason, which guide human behavior to ensure self-preservation and peaceful coexistence. These laws are not divine commands or intuitive duties but rather logical conclusions about what is necessary for survival and social order.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believes that natural laws are derived from God's commandments and represent divine principles that guide human behavior towards a just and orderly society. These laws, according to Hobbes, are not known through intuition but rather understood as rational guidelines for preserving life and avoiding conflict.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a prominent philosopher and theologian, believed that human actions are ultimately directed towards God, who is the ultimate truth. Therefore, all human operations serve those who contemplate the truth.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas suggests that human actions and endeavors ultimately aim to benefit those in positions of power and influence, as they have the capacity to shape society and guide its direction. This perspective aligns with his broader philosophical views on natural law and hierarchy.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hare is a moral philosopher known for his prescriptivism, which suggests that moral statements are not merely expressions of feelings but carry imperatives and can be subject to rational analysis. Therefore, he would likely argue against the idea that all moral arguments are useless or ad hominem attacks (which target individuals rather than addressing the argument). Between 'valid' and 'sound,' a sound argument is stronger as it requires both validity and true premises. Hare might claim that while not all moral arguments can be proven to have universally true premises, they are still meaningful in their prescriptive nature.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hare argues that all moral arguments are logically valid because they are based on universalizable principles and aim to persuade others to adopt a particular moral standpoint. Therefore, the correct answer is that he claims all moral arguments are 'valid'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier\u2019s theory, the second step in assessing whether an action is morally permissible involves examining if the moral rule that forbids the action is indeed a genuine moral rule. This means evaluating the legitimacy and applicability of the moral rule itself before considering its implications on the specific action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After identifying a moral rule that forbids an action, Baier suggests that the next step is to determine whether one can personally approve of the action and find it justifiable based on their own values. This involves reflecting on the reasons behind the moral rule and assessing its applicability in the given situation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Morality is generally understood as principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior, which guides human actions and decisions. It provides a framework for evaluating conduct and making ethical choices in various situations. Therefore, morality serves as a comprehensive guide to conduct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues that morality is not essential for living a fulfilling life and that individuals can find meaning and purpose without adhering to moral principles or values. This perspective aligns with option B, which states that morality is not really relevant to our lives.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. G.E. Moore, in his work 'Principia Ethica', criticizes past philosophers for defining good in terms of natural properties or facts, which he argues is a mistake. This error is known as the naturalistic fallacy because it attempts to derive an ethical conclusion from purely descriptive premises.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore criticizes past philosophers for engaging in circular reasoning when defining good, as they often assume the very concept they are trying to define within their explanations. This is known as the naturalistic fallacy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hard determinism is the belief that all events, including human actions, are determined by external factors and thus not free will exists. This conflicts with our sense of deliberation and the feeling that some actions are up to us, which implies a degree of freedom in decision-making.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hard determinism, according to Taylor, contradicts the established findings of science, which demonstrate that human actions are ultimately determined by physical laws and causal chains. This viewpoint conflicts with our intuitive sense of free will and moral responsibility, as it suggests that all events, including human decisions and actions, are predetermined.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, believed that the highest good is pleasure and that virtue is instrumental in achieving a pleasurable life. Among virtues, he emphasized prudence (wise decision-making) as the most important because it guides one to make choices leading to happiness and avoidance of pain.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believes that courage is the fundamental virtue from which all other virtues arise, as it provides the strength and resilience to act ethically and pursue a good life. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this foundational role of courage in his philosophy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Leo Tolstoy, a renowned Russian author and philosopher, had specific views on art that emphasized its communicative function. He believed that the purpose of art is to convey emotions from the artist to the audience through a shared experience. This process involves expression as it requires conveying feelings or ideas. Therefore, Tolstoy's view aligns most closely with 'expression'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy defines art as a form of representation that aims to depict the world as it is, capturing the essence of reality through various artistic mediums. He emphasizes the importance of conveying emotions and experiences in a way that resonates with others. Therefore, among the given options, 'representation' best aligns with Tolstoy's view on what constitutes art.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Clarence Darrow, a prominent lawyer and agnostic, believed that life had no inherent meaning or purpose beyond what individuals gave it themselves. He argued against the idea of an afterlife and divine justice, emphasizing human responsibility for creating their own values and meanings in life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While Clarence Darrow held a pessimistic view on life's meaning, he acknowledged that life could still be meaningful for most people who find purpose in their experiences and relationships. Therefore, the answer is not about life being worthless or solely uncertain but rather finding meaning despite its inherent challenges.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Butler, an 18th-century philosopher, believed that virtuous actions are guided by the highest moral principle within us, which he referred to as conscience or practical reason. This principle helps individuals discern right from wrong and act accordingly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Butler's emphasis on inward principles suggests that acting virtuously is about following our strongest internal inclinations, the ones that exert the most influence on our behavior. This aligns with his view of conscience as a guide to moral action based on these inner principles.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Thomas Hobbes, in the state of nature, there is no common authority or government to enforce laws and social contracts. In this condition, individuals act solely based on their own self-interest without regard for moral standards or justice. Therefore, notions of right and wrong or justice and injustice have no place.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While the state of nature is characterized by the absence of government, it doesn't mean that individuals lack any sense of right and wrong. These notions still serve as guiding ideals, influencing their actions. Therefore, according to Hobbes, in the state of nature, notions of right and wrong or justice and injustice 'still apply to the actions of men'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, a philosopher known for her work on ethics and human development, argues that in the first stage of ethical inquiry, terms used to describe virtues should be neutral among competing specifications. This allows for an open discussion without bias towards any particular cultural or societal norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's approach to ethical inquiry suggests that at the first stage, we should strive for comprehensive descriptions of virtues, capturing their various aspects and nuances. This allows us to understand them in a way that is not limited or biased towards any particular interpretation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral theory is primarily concerned with the principles that determine whether an action or behavior is morally right or wrong, based on ethical reasoning and values.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral theory's primary function is to elucidate the causal connections between different moral events, explaining how one moral action leads to another. It helps us understand why certain actions are considered morally right or wrong based on their consequences and underlying principles.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that suggests actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce the opposite of happiness, which includes pain. John Stuart Mill, one of its proponents, emphasized not just any pleasure but higher pleasures related to intellectual and emotional fulfillment. Therefore, the ultimate end of utilitarianism according to Mill is an existence as free from pain as possible and rich in 'enjoyments', which encompasses both physical and mental well-being.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's utilitarianism emphasizes the maximization of happiness, which includes not only pleasure but also social achievements and the fulfillment that comes from contributing to society. The ultimate end is an existence rich in both freedom from pain and positive experiences.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues that the moral saint, who is solely focused on morality to an extreme degree, can be unattractive due to their lack of personal interests and individuality. This critique does not directly target utilitarianism or Kantianism as ethical theories but rather challenges a potential consequence of adopting any single-minded moral approach. Therefore, Wolf's argument about the unattractiveness of the moral saint neither gives us reason to abandon utilitarianism nor Kantianism specifically.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf's argument about the unattractiveness of the moral saint is a direct challenge to Kantianism, as it suggests that the strict adherence to duty can lead to an undesirable and impractical way of life. This critique does not directly address utilitarianism, which focuses on maximizing overall happiness rather than following duties for their own sake.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Plato's definition of knowledge as justified true belief, for something to be considered 'knowledge', it must not only be believed but also justified and true. If a statement is false, then no matter how much we believe or justify it, it cannot meet the criteria of being true. Therefore, we can never truly know something that is false because our knowledge requires truth as an essential component.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Even if something is false, we can still provide justifications or reasons for believing it, which means that according to Plato's definition, we could potentially know something that is actually false. However, the essence of knowledge as 'justified true belief' implies that our justification must align with reality; thus, if a belief is false, its justification would not hold up in relation to truth. Therefore, it becomes impossible for us really to know something that is false because there can be no proper justification for an untrue claim.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his Meditations on First Philosophy, introduces the concept of an evil demon as a powerful being that could potentially deceive him into believing falsehoods about reality. This thought experiment is used to cast doubt on all sensory perception and knowledge derived from it.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes's argument suggests that if God exists, then the possibility of an evil demon deceiving us must also exist, as God's omnipotence would allow for such a being. This is part of his methodological skepticism to doubt everything until he reaches something indubitable.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that virtues are not innate or given by the gods, but rather they are developed through practice and habituation. According to his ethical theory, virtues arise from repeatedly performing virtuous actions until they become a part of one's character.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's understanding of virtues aligns with the idea that they are innate qualities, present in individuals from birth and shaping their character. He believed that through practice and habituation, these inherent traits could be developed into moral excellence.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier's foundational crisis in morality revolves around the tension between self-interest and cooperation, where individuals face a dilemma of whether to act out of enlightened egoism or adhere to moral constraints for mutual benefit. This concept is central to his theory of contractarian ethics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The moral system facing a crisis, as described by Gauthier, is essentially based on enlightened egoism, where individuals act in their own self-interest while considering the long-term consequences. This approach acknowledges that cooperation and mutual benefit are essential for overall well-being.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ensuring informed consent involves presenting all relevant information about a study to participants, which can be challenging due to practical limitations and potential impact on participant behavior. It may not always be feasible to provide every detail (A), there might be instances where withholding certain information is necessary for the integrity of the research (B), and revealing too much could alter participant responses (C). Therefore, all these factors contribute to making it 'easier said than done' to adhere strictly to informed consent principles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main difficulty in ensuring informed consent lies in the impracticality of presenting participants with every single detail about the study, which could be overwhelming and unnecessary. Additionally, there are instances where researchers might need to withhold certain information (like the exact duration of an interview) to avoid influencing participant behavior or responses. Therefore, all these factors contribute to why it's 'easier said than done' to adhere strictly to informed consent principles.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In his paper, Stevenson focuses on clarifying the language and concepts used in discussions about ethics to better understand and communicate ethical issues. His approach is not primarily concerned with defining right actions or establishing intrinsic goods but rather aims at making ethical questions more comprehensible through linguistic analysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson's primary goal in the paper is to establish a clear and objective account of what makes right actions right, providing a foundation for ethical decision-making. This aligns with option A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In the moral life, feelings play a significant role as they are closely tied to our values and emotional responses to situations. They can be essential in guiding us towards empathy and understanding others' perspectives, making them an integral part of ethical decision-making. However, while important, feelings alone cannot serve as the sole guide for moral actions due to their subjective nature.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Feelings play a vital role in ensuring impartiality within the moral life, as they allow us to connect with the experiences of others and understand their perspectives. This empathetic understanding is crucial for making fair judgments and decisions that consider everyone involved.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle, in his work 'Nicomachean Ethics', argues that the highest good for humans is eudaimonia, which is often translated as happiness or flourishing. He believes this to be an objective state of being well and doing well in being alive, rather than a subjective feeling. Therefore, according to Aristotle's philosophy, nearly everyone would agree that it is happiness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While there might be some individual variations, there is no general agreement on the answer to the question of the highest good of human action, as different people prioritize different values and goals. Aristotle himself believed that happiness (eudaimonia) was the ultimate goal but acknowledged that not everyone agreed.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Art is subjective, and people have different tastes, backgrounds, and perspectives that influence their opinions on its aesthetic value or social relevance. It is natural for disagreements to arise in discussions about art due to these varying viewpoints.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Disagreements about the aesthetic value or social relevance of art are relatively uncommon, as there are often established standards and criteria for judging artistic merit. However, it is not vacuous to have differing opinions on these matters, nor does it mean that such disagreements are never serious. In fact, debates about the meaning and value of art can be quite intense and significant in various contexts.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Peter Singer is a contemporary philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly utilitarianism and animal rights. His conclusions are most similar to those of Immanuel Kant, who also focused on moral philosophy and the importance of rationality and duty.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's ethical framework, with its focus on universal principles and the equal consideration of interests, aligns closely with the deontological ethics of Immanuel Kant. Both philosophers emphasize duty-based morality over consequentialist considerations.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hare, a moral philosopher, emphasized the importance of universalizability (the idea that moral judgments must apply universally) and prescriptivity (the notion that moral judgments entail obligations or recommendations for action). These two features are central to his understanding of the logic behind moral judgments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The key features of the logic of moral judgments, as described by Hare, are consistency and coherence, ensuring that our moral principles are logically sound and free from contradictions. This aligns with his prescriptivist approach to ethics.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, in his political philosophy, argued that individuals consent to form a society and government for the protection of their rights. In this social contract, they agree to abide by the decisions made collectively through majority rule. Therefore, when one consents to be part of a body politic under one government, he puts himself under an obligation to submit to the determination of the majority.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In Locke's view, individuals who consent to a government agree to submit to the decisions of judges, who interpret and enforce the laws of the society. This ensures that everyone is treated fairly under the law.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic values are concerned with the appreciation, beauty, and taste in art or nature. They do not directly relate to moral judgments about artists or critics nor pragmatic decisions regarding display. Instead, they pertain to the qualities that make works of art and other objects beautiful or pleasing. Therefore, aesthetic values are related to good and bad works of art based on their beauty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic values primarily deal with the moral dimensions of art and other objects of beauty, considering their ethical implications and impact on society. This encompasses how works of art are perceived in terms of morality rather than just their aesthetic appeal or technical quality.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt, a critic of act-utilitarianism, argues that it can lead to implausible consequences due to its focus on individual actions rather than rules or principles. This criticism is based on the idea that act-utilitarianism may justify morally questionable acts if they result in greater overall happiness. While Brandt's critique does not directly address self-contradiction, it implies potential moral dilemmas and implausible outcomes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's argument against act-utilitarianism highlights its numerous shortcomings, including self-contradictions, the creation of moral dilemmas, and implausible consequences. Therefore, his claim encompasses all these issues.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls introduces the concept of 'justice as fairness', which is based on principles agreed upon in an initial position known as the original position. In this hypothetical situation, individuals are behind a veil of ignorance and do not know their place in society or personal characteristics. This ensures that they choose principles fairly without bias towards any particular advantage. The term 'fair' best captures the essence of this initial position.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The initial position in Rawls' theory refers to the starting point of the thought experiment, where individuals would use logical reasoning to arrive at principles of justice. This is known as the 'original position', and it requires participants to be rational actors who are unaware of their own personal circumstances (the veil of ignorance). Therefore, the correct answer reflects this requirement for rationality.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill, a prominent utilitarian philosopher, distinguished between justice and other moral obligations based on the nature of the duty involved. Justice is associated with rights-based claims that others have against us, while other moral obligations are more about promoting general welfare without specific entitlements. This distinction aligns closely with Mill's differentiation between perfect (specific duties to avoid harm) and imperfect obligations (duties of beneficence).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mill distinguishes justice from other moral obligations based on whether they involve positive actions we must perform or negative duties to avoid harm. Justice typically involves positive duties, such as keeping promises or returning borrowed items, while non-justice obligations often pertain to negative duties like not causing unnecessary suffering.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Plato argues that true knowledge comes from understanding the Forms or essences beyond the world of particular objects. This means our certainty and knowledge are not derived solely from sensory experiences, which are subject to change. Instead, they come from an innate ability to grasp these ideal forms. Therefore, the correct answer is that our absolutely certain knowledge cannot be based on changing sensible experience but must be triggered by it.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believes that our souls existed before birth and had knowledge of the Forms, which is then forgotten upon entering the world and needs to be triggered by experience. The senses alone cannot provide certainty because they are subject to change; instead, it is through recollection (anamnesis) that we access innate knowledge of the unchanging Forms.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Butler, the degree to which one acts compassionately is influenced both by their inherent affection for compassion as well as other affections that might either enhance or detract from this inclination. Therefore, it depends on a combination of these factors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Butler, compassion is a powerful emotion that drives our actions, and the degree to which we act compassionately depends solely on the strength of this feeling. It does not depend on other affections besides compassion.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Book II of Plato's Republic, Glaucon argues that justice originates from a social agreement made to prevent mutual harm and maintain order in society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glaucon argues that justice is not a natural phenomenon but rather a human construct, stemming from our inherent desire for self-preservation and the need to avoid suffering harm. He suggests that people agree on rules of behavior (justice) only because they fear retaliation or punishment if they break them. Therefore, Glaucon claims that justice originates from a social agreement.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe, in her work 'Modern Moral Philosophy', criticizes the current understanding of moral obligation as being detached from its original context and meaning. She argues that modern discussions on morality have lost their connection to a divine lawgiver or objective standards, rendering the concept of moral obligation empty without these foundations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argues that the concept of moral obligation has lost its meaning in modern society, as it is now simply a reflection of the prevailing social norms and expectations. She believes that without a clear understanding of what constitutes 'good', 'bad', or 'right' actions based on objective standards, the term 'moral obligation' becomes empty.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Constitutive moral luck refers to aspects of one's character or identity that are beyond their control but still affect how they are morally judged. Option A describes a person with inherent negative traits, which is an example of bad constitutive moral luck as these traits can lead to immoral actions despite not being chosen by the individual.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bad constitutive moral luck refers to situations where individuals are born into environments or historical periods that negatively shape their moral character, such as living in Nazi Germany. Option A describes a person with inherent negative traits but doesn't necessarily involve external circumstances shaping those traits. Option C involves bad consequential luck rather than constitutive moral luck.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Meno's Paradox is about how one can inquire or learn something without already knowing it, as inquiry seems to presuppose some knowledge of what we are looking for.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Meno's Paradox questions how we can remember knowledge of the Forms after being born into this world, as the shock of birth would erase all prior knowledge. Plato suggests that knowledge is innate and recollected through experience.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that virtues are habits developed through practice, leading to a balanced character and the ultimate goal of eudaimonia (flourishing). His theory was not considered final or absolute but rather open to interpretation and application in various contexts. Therefore, his view on virtues can be seen as open-ended and revisable.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's theory of virtues is deeply rooted in the specific cultural and societal norms of ancient Greece, making it difficult to apply universally across different cultures and time periods. His ideas were shaped by his environment and experiences.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, a prominent philosopher in the field of virtue ethics, argues that turning to an approach based on virtues is often associated with relativism. This is because virtue ethics emphasizes character and moral education over universal rules or principles, which can lead to different interpretations depending on cultural contexts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that the shift towards virtue ethics represents a move towards absolute moral principles, emphasizing universal values and objective standards of right and wrong. This approach contrasts with relativistic or empirical perspectives.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's Divided Line represents the distinction between knowledge and opinion, with knowledge being higher on the line due to its connection to Forms or innate ideas. These Forms are perceived as rationally ordered and provide justification for true beliefs. Therefore, according to Plato, knowledge is attained when our sensible experience aligns with these rational concepts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's Divided Line illustrates that knowledge is ultimately based on our individual beliefs and interpretations of the world, shaped by our experiences and upbringing. However, for Plato, true knowledge goes beyond mere sensory perception or personal opinions; it involves understanding universal concepts or Forms that are perceived as rationally ordered.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, is known for his empirical approach and skepticism about rationalist philosophy. He argued that reason alone cannot be the source of morality or motivation but rather serves to guide our desires which are based on passion. Therefore, he described reason as 'cool and disengaged', not directly causing actions but helping us navigate them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume believes that reason plays a central role in guiding our moral actions, as it allows us to understand the consequences of our choices and make rational decisions. Therefore, he describes reason as 'the source of all moral actions'.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge is epistemology. Questions about what constitutes knowledge or truth are central to this field.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Questions about knowledge and truth fall under the domain of aesthetics, as they relate to our perception and understanding of beauty and artistic expression. Logic deals with reasoning and argumentation; metaphysics explores fundamental nature of reality; epistemology studies the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic value is often associated with the appreciation of beauty or artistic merit, which does not necessarily depend on utility or functionality. An object can have aesthetic value even if it serves an important function (C) or has meaning (D). However, saying that something cannot be defined (A) doesn't directly relate to its aesthetic value. The best answer is that an object with no utility (B), i.e., not serving any practical purpose, can still possess aesthetic value purely based on its beauty or artistic qualities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic value is an inherently subjective and undefinable concept, as it varies greatly based on individual preferences and cultural backgrounds. The idea that something has aesthetic value does not necessarily depend on its utility or function, nor does it require the object to be meaningless. Instead, it's about the appreciation of beauty or artistic expression which cannot be strictly defined.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Mill, the value of a pleasure is determined not just by its intensity but also by its quality and how it contributes to human well-being. He proposed that pleasures preferred by those who have experienced both 'higher' (intellectual) and 'lower' (physical) pleasures are more valuable, as they can discern the difference in quality.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill suggests that we can rely on scientific methods to objectively measure and compare the intensity and duration of different pleasures, thus determining their relative value. This approach aligns with his utilitarian philosophy which emphasizes empirical evidence.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, a Greek philosopher, believed in the pursuit of happiness through the absence of pain and fear. He argued that since we do not experience anything after death, it should not be feared or cause us distress during life. Therefore, according to Epicurus, the wise man is unconcerned with death.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that the wise person recognizes the futility of life and actively seeks its end, as death represents the ultimate release from suffering. The fear of death only serves to disturb one's peace of mind. Therefore, according to Epicurus, a wise man does not yearn for or fear the cessation of life but rather views it with indifference.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that morality can be justified through a social contract, where individuals agree to constrain their self-interest for mutual benefit (C). He also believes in deliberative justification and acknowledges the challenges faced by morality (A & B). However, he does not define rational agents solely as those who maximize preference fulfillment; instead, they are individuals who recognize the benefits of cooperation. Therefore, option D is inconsistent with Gauthier's view.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that rational agents are primarily concerned with maximizing their own preferences and self-interest, even if it comes at the expense of others. However, he also believes in mutual agreement to constrain this pursuit for collective benefit. Therefore, he would not accept option D as it contradicts his view on rational agents.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle argues that the essence of a thing is intrinsically tied to its existence in the world and cannot exist apart from it. Therefore, if all members of a species were destroyed, their essence or form would also cease to exist because there are no longer any individuals embodying that essence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle rejects the Platonic notion of Forms and argues that essences or forms do not exist independently of individual objects, suggesting that there are only particular things in the world. If all members of a species were destroyed, their specific form would no longer be instantiated; however, since for Aristotle, essence is tied to existence, without any individuals embodying it, the essence or form cannot exist.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When using visual methods in a research project, it is important to consider legal guidelines and ethical concerns such as protecting individuals from potential harm (B), any risk of invasion of privacy (C), and understanding the implications of capturing images or videos in public spaces (A). Therefore, all these factors should be taken into consideration.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When using visual methods, the primary concern should be understanding the legal boundaries of public spaces, as this determines what can be photographed or recorded. Additionally, protecting individuals from potential harm is crucial to ensure ethical research practices. Lastly, respecting privacy and avoiding any invasion of it is essential when capturing visual data. Therefore, all these factors must be considered alongside legal guidelines.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg, a philosopher known for his work on ethics and moral philosophy, argues that pursuing pleasure directly is not always conducive to long-term happiness. Instead, he suggests focusing on activities or goals that inherently lead to fulfillment and satisfaction, which in turn contribute to overall happiness.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg suggests that the best way to achieve happiness is to actively pursue pleasure and seek out enjoyable experiences. This aligns with his philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of personal fulfillment through positive emotions and gratifying activities.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine was a critic of Academic skepticism, which is the philosophical position that we can know nothing with certainty. He argued against this viewpoint, asserting that it could be refuted and therefore was false. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with his criticism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's extensive writings against Academic skepticism clearly demonstrate its validity and prove its central tenets. He argues that while it may not be possible to attain absolute certainty, we can still have reasonable beliefs based on evidence and experience.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. When people are hungry, they typically desire to eat food as it satisfies their hunger. Additionally, eating often involves pleasant gustatory sensations that contribute to the overall experience of satisfying hunger. Therefore, both options A and B describe typical desires when someone is hungry.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hunger is a physiological state that triggers a desire for specific sensory experiences, such as the taste and texture of food, rather than the food itself. When people are hungry, they typically crave pleasant gustatory sensations associated with eating.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to G.E. Moore, when he says 'pleasure is good', it means that pleasure has intrinsic value and is desirable for its own sake. This aligns with the idea that if something is considered good, then people naturally desire it because of its inherent qualities. Therefore, saying 'pleasure is desired' captures this concept accurately.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's argument implies that the concept of 'good' cannot be reduced to mere pleasure, leading to the conclusion that we desire the act of desiring pleasure itself. This is because he believes that goodness and pleasure are distinct concepts.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Annette Baier, a moral philosopher, emphasizes the importance of trust and relationships in ethical discussions. When seeking moral advice, it is not merely about receiving commands or preferences but engaging in a process that involves understanding others' perspectives and reasoning together to reach an informed decision.",C,"Let's reason step by step. When seeking moral advice, we essentially request guidance in the form of clear instructions on the appropriate course of action. This aligns more closely with Baier's concept of issuing commands rather than merely sharing preferences, engaging in deliberation, or empathizing.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Aristotle's terminology, incontinence refers to a lack of self-control or weakness of will where an individual knows what is morally correct but fails to act accordingly due to their desires overpowering their rational judgment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Incontinence, as described by Aristotle, refers to the ability to recognize and control one's emotions, preventing them from influencing actions. It is a state where an individual knows their feelings are inappropriate but manages not to act on them.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. W. D. Ross, a philosopher known for his work on ethics and morality, defined justice as fairness in the distribution of happiness or well-being among individuals. He emphasized that this should be done according to merit, meaning those who contribute more positively to society deserve greater rewards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's conception of justice aligns with the principle of upholding the law, ensuring that all rules and regulations are followed without exception. This approach emphasizes fairness in society through adherence to established legal frameworks.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Keeping personal data of research participants secure is crucial for protecting their privacy, ensuring confidentiality, and preventing potential harm that could arise from unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information. The primary concern here is the risk to individuals, places, or organizations if such data were exposed.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Maintaining confidentiality in research allows researchers to delve deeper into participants' lives and gather more comprehensive data without their explicit knowledge. This can lead to a better understanding of the subject matter, which is crucial for advancing scientific knowledge.",D

He concludes that while some of these methods may seem appealing or persuasive in the short term, they ultimately fail to provide a solid foundation for dismissing moral obligations. Therefore, none of them are successful.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hare acknowledges that certain methods of avoiding moral arguments can be effective in specific situations, allowing individuals to escape moral obligations without consequence. However, he also points out the potential drawbacks and limitations associated with these strategies. Therefore, while some may work temporarily or under particular circumstances, they are not universally successful.",B

It focuses on the potential negative consequences, such as exacerbating poverty and social inequality, that may result from incarcerating individuals for their inability to pay debts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The moral objection to imprisoning debtor A stems from the potential negative consequences, such as financial hardship and family separation, that such punishment would inflict. This aligns with a consequentialist perspective on morality.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Socratic method is a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. It was named after the classical Greek philosopher Socrates. An argument can be any discussion or debate but doesn't necessarily involve methodical scrutiny of propositions. The Socratic jest is not a recognized term in this context, and while debates involve discussions to uncover truths, they are more confrontational than the cooperative nature described here.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Socratic method, characterized by its structured question-and-answer format and pursuit of truth, can be broadly categorized as a type of debate. However, the specific mention of 'propositions are methodically scrutinized to uncover the truth' aligns more closely with the Socratic method than general debates or arguments.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Paley, in his watchmaker analogy, argues that just as a watch implies the existence of an intelligent designer (a watchmaker), so too does the complexity and design found in nature imply the existence of a divine creator. Therefore, every indication of contrivance and design that exists in the watch also exists in the works of nature.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Paley's argument implies that the intricate design found in both watches and natural phenomena is a product of time, gradually shaping and perfecting their mechanisms.

However, he later revised his theory to propose that this interaction took place in the pineal gland, which is a small endocrine gland in the vertebrate brain.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Nagel, in his discussions on skepticism, argues that most skeptical arguments are not valid because they apply overly strict criteria to what counts as knowledge or justified belief. He believes these standards are often arbitrary and do not reflect the ordinary ways we understand and interact with the world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel's analysis of skepticism reveals that most skeptical arguments ultimately contradict themselves and fail to provide a coherent basis for doubt. This self-refutation occurs because the very act of doubting presupposes some form of knowledge or certainty, which is what skepticism seeks to undermine.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, in Plato's dialogue 'Crito', argues that one should not commit an unjust act even if it is advantageous to oneself or loved ones. He believes that justice and the rule of law are paramount, so breaking out of prison would be against his principles unless it was justified by a higher moral standard.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates advises Crito that escaping prison is only justifiable if it serves his own best interests and improves his personal circumstances. This aligns with the idea of acting to one's advantage, rather than focusing on harm to enemies or pleasing gods.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre, a prominent existentialist philosopher, argued that if God doesn't exist, there is no predetermined essence or purpose for humanity. This means humans must create their own values and meanings in life. The statement 'anything is permissible' aligns with this view as it suggests the absence of inherent moral values.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, emphasized that individuals have control over their own judgments and reactions to external events but not the events themselves. According to his teachings, what one can truly call 'one's own' is how they deal with impressions or perceptions of those events.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that our bodies are the only things truly under our control, as they are not subject to external influences or the whims of fate. Everything else is outside of our direct influence and thus cannot be considered 'ours'. Therefore, according to Epictetus, one can call their own body.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher known for his work on utilitarianism, argued that human beings are motivated by the pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain. This principle is central to his ethical theory, which suggests that actions should be judged based on their ability to maximize happiness (pleasure) and minimize suffering (pain). Therefore, Bentham's claim about nature placing mankind under two sovereign masters refers to these concepts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's philosophy revolves around the idea that our actions are ultimately guided by the pursuit of good and the avoidance of evil, which serve as the fundamental motivators of human behavior. This concept is central to his utilitarian ethical theory.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's moral philosophy, known as deontological ethics or the categorical imperative, emphasizes that actions should be guided by principles that can be universally applied without contradiction. The idea is to determine if an action could become a universal law that everyone would follow consistently. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with Kant's philosophy of universalizability.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that moral actions are those that can be applied as contingent laws, meaning they are dependent on specific circumstances and contexts. However, his Categorical Imperative requires us to consider whether the maxim of our action could become a universal law, applicable in all situations without contradiction.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Mill, happiness is not just about tranquility or excitement alone but rather the presence of both higher (intellectual pleasures) and lower (sensory pleasures) forms of pleasure in life. Therefore, a happy life for Mill would involve a balance between calmness and stimulation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill argued that a truly happy life is one that avoids both excessive tranquility and excitement, as these states can lead to stagnation and instability, respectively. Instead, he believed in the principle of 'higher pleasures', which involve intellectual pursuits and personal growth. Therefore, neither extreme tranquility nor constant excitement defines a happy life according to Mill.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The control condition in moral philosophy often refers to the idea that individuals should not be held responsible or judged for actions influenced by factors beyond their control. This concept is closely related to discussions on free will and determinism, where external circumstances can limit an individual's ability to make choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The control condition emphasizes the importance of respecting individual autonomy and refraining from attempting to control the actions or choices of others. It suggests that it is morally wrong to interfere with another person's life, especially when they are an adult capable of making their own decisions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, a contemporary philosopher and scholar on Aristotle, argues that for Aristotle, virtues are not merely conventional or traditional but rather grounded in the lived experiences of individuals. This means that each virtue term is defined through practical engagement with life's challenges and moral dilemmas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that Aristotle believed the meaning of virtue terms is determined by thick descriptions, which provide rich and detailed accounts of virtuous actions and character traits. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of virtues in context.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Locke, in the state of nature, individuals enjoy natural rights and freedoms but lack security due to potential conflicts with others. By entering into a social contract and relinquishing some freedom to the state, they gain protection for their life, liberty, and property. This trade-off is made because the enjoyment of one's freedom becomes more certain and secure under the governance of a state.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke believed that individuals willingly give up their absolute freedom in the state of nature to join a society where they can continue to enjoy the same level of freedom under the protection of the state. This is because, according to Locke, life and property are better secured within an organized government than in the state of nature.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Richard Brandt's theory is a form of rule utilitarianism which suggests that an ideal moral rule should maximize overall happiness and well-being, considering both the positive and negative consequences (utilities) of actions. Therefore, it would not ignore either type of utility but rather aim to balance them for the greatest good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's ideal moral rule prioritizes actions that maximize positive outcomes and benefits for individuals and society, even if they may involve some negative consequences. However, it does not ignore the negative utilities but rather aims to balance both in order to achieve the greatest overall utility.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'hare' in this context refers to individuals who support ideals without considering the practical implications or consequences on people's interests. This behavior aligns with fanaticism, which is characterized by excessive zeal and uncritical devotion to a cause, often disregarding others' well-being.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hare uses the term 'amoralist' to describe individuals who prioritize ideals and principles without considering the impact of their actions on the well-being and interests of others. This definition aligns with option B, as fanatics are excessively enthusiastic but not necessarily disregarding people's interests; immoralists act against moral norms, which is different from just endorsing ideals without regard for consequences; maniacs imply a state of mental illness or extreme behavior that doesn't specifically relate to the concept described.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, in his philosophical discussions, often explored the concept of holiness and its relation to other virtues. He believed that true knowledge leads to a good life, which encompasses various aspects such as prudence, justice, beauty, and legality. However, when it comes to the holy specifically, Socrates is known for associating it with what is beautiful, arguing that holiness and beauty are intertwined.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that the concept of holiness is closely linked to beauty, as both represent ideals that inspire awe and reverence in individuals. He argued that what is holy or divine shares characteristics with what is beautiful, such as harmony, proportion, and goodness. Therefore, among the given options, Socrates would suggest that the holy is one part of 'what is beautiful'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls argues that behind the veil of ignorance, individuals do not know their place in society and are therefore motivated to choose principles of justice that ensure fairness for all. This process is akin to making a fair agreement or bargain without knowing one's own position.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' veil of ignorance, by removing knowledge of individual circumstances, results in principles of justice that are too abstract and idealistic to be effectively implemented in real-world situations. The idea is not about coercion or arbitrary choices but rather a hypothetical scenario for fairness.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument in his principle of equal consideration of interests focuses on the prevention of suffering and death due to poverty-related causes such as lack of food, shelter, and medical care. He argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument for alleviating suffering is based on the fundamental principle that all people are created equal and therefore deserve equal consideration and assistance, regardless of their circumstances. This assumption underlies his call to action against preventable harm such as starvation or lack of medical care.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham, as the founder of utilitarianism, believed that moral decisions should be based on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people. This principle guides both our actions (what we ought to do) and predicts human behavior (what we will do). Therefore, considerations of pain and pleasure determine both what we ought to do and what we will do.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's principle of utility suggests that considerations of pain and pleasure primarily influence our future actions, as we naturally seek to maximize pleasure and minimize pain in our choices. While these considerations can inform what we ought to do from a moral standpoint, they are more directly related to predicting or explaining what we will actually choose to do.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Formal characteristics of art refer to the visual elements and principles that are used in a work, such as line, shape, color, texture, space, balance, contrast, emphasis, movement, pattern, rhythm, and unity. These aspects contribute to the overall coherence or harmony within an artwork. Therefore, among the given options, 'coherence' best represents an important formal characteristic of art.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important formal characteristic of art is its ability to evoke strong emotions and connect with viewers on a deep and personal level, regardless of its structural or technical aspects. While social meaning, faithful representation, and coherence are all significant elements in certain contexts, the power to elicit an emotional response is universally recognized as a key aspect of art.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher, believed that each person has two aspects of character: one universal, shared with all humanity, and the other individual, unique to each person. This aligns with his Stoic philosophy which emphasizes common rational nature among humans.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero believed that every individual possesses two inherent characters: one that is virtuous and inclined towards good, and another that is vicious and prone to evil. This dual nature reflects the struggle between moral virtue and vice within each person.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's 'Nicomachean Ethics' is a philosophical work that discusses the nature of human happiness and virtue ethics. The book concludes with an exploration of how individual virtues contribute to the well-being of society, which naturally leads into political philosophy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is politics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's Ethics culminates in a discussion of natural science, as he believed that understanding the natural world is essential for achieving a virtuous and fulfilling life. This connection between ethics and natural science reflects his holistic approach to knowledge.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill is known for his contributions to utilitarian philosophy, which focuses on the greatest happiness principle. Act-utilitarianism evaluates each action based on its consequences, while rule-utilitarianism considers rules that lead to the greatest good when generally followed. Mill's view aligns with act-utilitarianism as he emphasized assessing actions by their outcomes rather than adherence to societal or ideal moral rules.",A,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill's ethical views closely resemble Kant's deontological ethics, as both emphasize the importance of universal moral principles and duties that guide our actions. However, among the given options, act-utilitarianism is a more fitting choice because it focuses on maximizing overall happiness or utility in each individual action, which aligns with Mill's consequentialist approach to ethics.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Rawls, entering the original position involves a hypothetical situation where individuals choose principles of justice behind a 'veil of ignorance', not knowing their place in society or personal characteristics. This thought experiment is designed to ensure fairness and impartiality when determining the basic structure of society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To truly understand justice, we must remove ourselves from the existing social structure and rebuild it from the ground up. This thought experiment allows us to consider principles of justice without being influenced by our own personal circumstances or societal biases.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of modern utilitarianism, argued that the morality of an action is determined solely by its consequences and the amount of pleasure or pain it produces. Therefore, actions are right if they promote happiness and wrong if they produce unhappiness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's focus on maximizing overall happiness suggests that neither the intentions behind actions nor their specific outcomes truly matter. Instead, it is the net result of an action in terms of pleasure and pain that determines its moral value.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist philosopher, argued that for human beings (man), existence precedes essence. This means that individuals first exist without any predetermined purpose or nature and then define their own essence through actions and choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre's idea of creating one's own essence through choices points to future generations who will define themselves through their actions. Therefore, the being in whom existence precedes essence is 'future man'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg, a philosopher known for his work on ethics and moral education, emphasized that good moral education should aim to develop individuals who understand and appreciate the intrinsic value of doing what is right, rather than merely following rules or seeking rewards/punishments. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with this philosophy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A truly effective moral education, as Feinberg suggests, avoids using pleasure or pain as motivators for ethical behavior. Instead, it aims to cultivate an understanding of morality that leads individuals to do the right thing because they recognize its inherent value and not merely due to external rewards or punishments.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. G.E.M. Anscombe, a prominent philosopher, criticized Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy in her work 'Modern Moral Philosophy'. She particularly took issue with the concept of duty for its own sake and the idea that morality is grounded in rationality alone. Among the options provided, the categorical imperative best represents this aspect of Kantian ethics as it posits a universal moral law derived from reason.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe likely found fault with Kant's notion of the thing-in-itself, as it posits an unknowable reality beyond our experience. This concept was criticized because it seems to contradict empirical evidence and logical reasoning.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates acknowledges his ignorance and understands the importance of seeking knowledge, particularly regarding essential concepts like justice. His wisdom lies in recognizing that actions without understanding these essences are rationally unjustified. Therefore, he knows what to look for - knowledge of the essences.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' wisdom lies in his constant questioning of his own methods for seeking knowledge, acknowledging the potential flaws in his approach. He recognizes that without understanding the essence or nature of things like justice, actions cannot be rationally justified. This implies he is aware of what he seeks (knowledge of essences) and questions the validity of his own methods.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, a rule is for the good of human beings if it meets certain criteria: it should not cause harm (A), avoid unnecessary restrictions (B), and promote overall good rather than benefiting only some individuals (C). Therefore, all these conditions must be met for a rule to be considered truly for the good of humanity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a rule to truly benefit humanity, as Baier suggests, it must first and foremost avoid causing any harm or detriment to individuals or society. Additionally, such rules should not impose unnecessary restrictions that could hinder personal freedoms or societal progress without just cause. Lastly, the rule should promote the good of all people rather than benefiting only a select few. Therefore, considering these aspects together is essential for determining if a rule serves humanity's overall well-being.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Soft determinism, also known as compatibilism, suggests that free will and determinism are compatible ideas. It posits that while our actions may be determined by external factors or internal states, we still have the freedom to choose within those constraints. Therefore, it accepts the thesis of determinism but maintains a form of free will.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Soft determinism implies that while our actions are ultimately determined, we still retain the freedom to choose and shape our own desires. This perspective acknowledges both determinism (our choices being influenced by external factors) and free will.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, a philosopher and classicist, has discussed how emotions are influenced by culture and society. Recent anthropological work supports this view, suggesting that fear is not experienced uniformly across all cultures but varies based on cultural norms and learning. Therefore, the most appropriate answer reflecting these findings would be that fear is partially learned and culturally variant.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's work likely highlights the universality of fear, suggesting that it is experienced similarly across all cultures and societies. This implies that while there may be cultural variations in how fear is expressed or managed, its fundamental experience remains consistent.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg argues that the claim of always feeling pleasure when getting what we want is not necessarily true because there are instances where people may feel regret, guilt or other negative emotions even after achieving their desires. Therefore, this does not support psychological egoism which posits that all human actions are motivated by self-interest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that we experience pleasure when our desires are fulfilled directly supports the idea of psychological egoism, as it demonstrates our inherent self-interest. Therefore, if this claim were true, it would indeed support psychological egoism.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Immanuel Kant, an influential figure in deontological ethics, the moral worth of an action does not depend on its consequences or the character of the agent performing it but rather on whether the action is performed out of a sense of duty and based on a universalizable maxim. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this principle.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's ethical framework suggests that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcomes and the overall consequences it produces. This aligns with his deontological approach, which emphasizes duty and adherence to universal principles rather than focusing on character or specific actions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, was known for his strong belief in moral absolutism and the importance of virtue. He argued against relativistic views on morality and emphasized that certain actions are inherently right or wrong regardless of cultural context. Among the options provided, the idea that 'moral rightness is relative to one’s culture' directly contradicts Cicero's stance on universal moral principles.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero's strong stance against lying stems from the belief that it undermines trust and disrupts the social fabric. He argued that lies, even if seemingly beneficial in the short term, could lead to greater harm in society.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believed that in the absence of a common power to maintain order, humans would be driven by their natural instincts and self-interest, leading to conflict and competition for resources. This state is famously described as 'the war of every man against every man,' where life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes likely believed that without a governing authority, humans would naturally coexist in a state of peace and cooperation. However, his philosophy actually posits the opposite: he argued that in the absence of a common power to enforce laws and maintain order, human life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,' characterized by constant conflict.",D
A,Let's reason step by step. Ross argues that our understanding of prima facie duties comes from recognizing specific instances where actions seem right and then abstracting general principles from these observations.,A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, our understanding of prima facie duties comes from general ethical principles that guide our judgment of specific actions. We recognize these duties through their application in particular situations and then abstract the underlying principles.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher, believed that the purpose of human life was to seek wisdom and knowledge through introspection and self-examination. He argued that without this examination, individuals would live unfulfilled lives lacking in virtue and understanding. Therefore, an unexamined life is considered tragic because it results in harm to one's soul.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' emphasis on self-examination stems from his belief that an unexamined life ultimately harms the state and undermines its stability. He argued that individuals who do not reflect upon their actions contribute to societal problems, leading to a lack of virtue among citizens.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley, an idealist philosopher, argued that the only things we can truly know are our perceptions and ideas in our minds. He famously stated 'esse est percipi', meaning to be is to be perceived. Therefore, sensible things exist only as they are perceived within a mind.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley's philosophy suggests that the existence of sensible things relies on their presence within a material substance, independent of the mind. This aligns with his theory of immaterialism or subjective idealism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls argues that in the original position, parties are behind a 'veil of ignorance', meaning they do not know their place in society or personal characteristics. This ensures fairness and impartiality when choosing principles for justice. Utilitarianism could lead to unjust outcomes as it focuses on maximizing overall happiness without considering individual rights. Therefore, parties would reject utilitarianism because it might require them to accept unfair treatment if it benefits the majority.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the parties in the original position are behind the veil of ignorance, they would have no knowledge of utilitarianism and therefore wouldn't consider it. Rawls argues that without knowing their place in society or personal circumstances, individuals would choose principles to ensure justice for all.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Hobbes, in his work 'Leviathan', describes felicity as the continual success in obtaining those things which a person desires. It is not merely about tranquility or contemplation but rather the ongoing fulfillment of one's desires and goals.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes likely viewed felicity as a state of deep contemplation and reflection, where desires and external pursuits are minimized. This aligns with his philosophical views on human nature and the social contract.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle begins ethical inquiry with the concept of 'telos', which is the ultimate aim or purpose of human life, according to his philosophy. He believes that understanding this aim helps in determining what constitutes a good and virtuous life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that ethical inquiry should begin by establishing our fundamental duties and obligations as humans. This is because he argued that virtues are habits developed through practice, which guide us in fulfilling these duties.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy is concerned with fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It examines the nature of beliefs and their justification rather than focusing on empirical or experimental methods used in social sciences. Therefore, philosophy studies what beliefs mean and whether people with different beliefs are justified in having them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy delves into the reasons why certain questions remain perpetually unanswered and lack definitive solutions. It explores abstract concepts, ethics, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language without relying on empirical evidence or scientific experiments.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Richard Brandt, a modern utilitarian philosopher, defends rule utilitarianism which suggests that the rightness of an action is determined by whether it conforms to a set of rules whose general acceptance would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. These are not just any rules but idealized ones that people would agree upon under fully informed and rational conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Utilitarianism, as I understand it, is all about maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering, so it makes sense that Brandt would focus on the consequences of particular acts to determine what's right. This aligns with classical utilitarianism which holds that an action is morally right if its consequences lead to happiness (or pleasure), and wrong if they do not.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that the supreme principle of morality, known as the categorical imperative, is not derived from experience (a posteriori) but rather through pure reason alone (a priori). Furthermore, it is synthetic because its truth cannot be determined solely by analyzing concepts; instead, it adds to our knowledge. Therefore, Kant's supreme principle of morality is best described as 'synthetic and a priori'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that moral laws are universal and apply to everyone, regardless of their individual experiences, so the supreme principle must be based on observation and experience, making it 'a posteriori'. However, he also argued that these principles were not derived from empirical observations but rather through pure reasoning, which makes them 'synthetic a priori' instead. Therefore, the correct answer is synthetic and a priori.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg criticizes psychological egoism, arguing that its proponents often rely on subjective interpretations of human behavior rather than empirical evidence. They tend to infer self-interest from actions without considering alternative explanations or motivations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that these arguments are nonempirical in character.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To understand how people behave, we need to conduct studies and gather data, so Feinberg's claim about psychological egoism must be based on controlled studies and observations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that arguments for psychological egoism are based on controlled studies.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant, a prominent philosopher, proposed that moral laws are universal and apply to all rational beings regardless of their circumstances or desires. These laws are not contingent on culture, humanity alone, or divine commands but rather stem from the inherent rational nature of individuals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that morality is based on reason, and since only humans possess reason, moral laws must be contingent and apply solely to human beings. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this view.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, a Christian philosopher and theologian, believed that humans are capable of making mistakes due to their free will and susceptibility to sin. However, he argued that errors in judgment or action occur when individuals lack knowledge (ignorance) or choose wrongly out of wickedness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, being a religious philosopher, would likely attribute errors to moral failings and wickedness, suggesting that we only err when we choose to do wrong. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that we can never err except through wickedness.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Deceiving participants in research can lead to a breach of trust, which is fundamental for ethical conduct in studies involving human subjects. This breach not only affects the relationship between the participant and the researcher but also has broader implications on the perception of the research community as a whole. Among the given options, damaging the professional reputation of the researcher and their discipline is an important ethical disadvantage because it undermines public trust in scientific inquiry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Deceiving participants might not be the best practice, but it doesn't really cause any harm beyond making the researcher look a bit dishonest, so it's not a major ethical issue. The main problem with deceiving participants is that they cannot give informed consent to participate in the study because they don't know what they are getting into. This could potentially lead to psychological distress or harm if the deception involves sensitive topics. However, none of these options directly address this key ethical issue.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, believed that morality is aligned with nature and its laws. Immorality goes against this natural order, making it repugnant to nature. On the other hand, expediency refers to actions taken for practical reasons rather than moral ones; thus, they may not align with nature's inherent goodness or justice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Immorality is clearly something that goes against our natural inclinations and what's best for us, while expediency, or doing what's practical, is more in line with our natural instincts. Cicero believed that true virtue lies in aligning oneself with nature rather than going against it.",B

According to him, reason should serve our passions by helping us figure out how best to achieve them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Reason is our ability to think logically and make sound judgments, so it should operate completely separately from our passions and emotions, which can cloud our judgment. Hume believed that while reason could inform us of the consequences of following a passion or not, it couldn't motivate action on its own.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek argues that in moral dilemmas where a choice must be made between saving one person or multiple people, it is not necessarily better to save more lives. He suggests that the value of each individual life should be considered separately and that there isn't always a clear-cut answer based on numbers alone.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It's a basic principle that losing two lives is always a greater tragedy than losing one, so Taurek must be arguing that the death of two people is always worse than the death of one.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Interest theories of the good focus on what is beneficial or desirable for an individual, emphasizing personal interests and well-being as central to defining goodness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Interest theories, as the name suggests, focus on what's in our best interest, so they must define goodness in terms of what benefits us personally. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'benefit to oneself'.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The notion of 'meaning in life' generally refers to the significance or purpose that individuals find within their own existence, rather than external sources such as a deity's plan or an afterlife. It is about personal fulfillment and understanding one's place in the world.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The meaning of life is something we search for outside ourselves, in the grand scheme of things and our place in the universe, so it must refer to external meaning. Internal meaning would be more about personal fulfillment or purpose within one's own life.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Psychological egoism is a descriptive theory that suggests individuals always act in their own self-interest, even when they appear to be acting altruistically. It does not prescribe how people ought to behave (which would make it normative), but rather makes a claim about human nature and behavior patterns.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Psychological egoism is simply the observation that people tend to act in their own self-interest most of the time, so it's a generalization about how people typically behave. It doesn't prescribe what we ought to do (ethical theory), nor does it claim anything about human nature or capabilities beyond observed behavior.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his philosophical exploration, famously stated 'Cogito, ergo sum', which translates to 'I think, therefore I am'. This statement emphasizes the certainty of one's existence through the act of thinking itself. Therefore, he declares that he is a thing that thinks.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes is known for his skepticism and questioning everything, so his declaration that he is 'a thing that cannot exist' must be a way of expressing his doubt about his own existence.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The view that we consist of two distinct substances, body and mind, which interact with each other is known as 'dualism'. Specifically, when these substances are considered fundamentally different in nature (one physical and the other mental), it falls under the category of 'substance dualism'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Materialism is the view that everything is made of matter, including the mind, so it must be the theory that explains how the body and mind interact as two distinct substances. Therefore, materialism fits this description.",D

This aligns with the concept that if time is not infinitely past, then there must be a starting point for the universe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the series of events in time cannot be infinite, then the universe must be a mental construct, existing only within our minds, as Craig suggests. This implies that there is no actual beginning or end to the universe.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that knowledge and virtue are intertwined, meaning one cannot truly possess virtue without understanding it. This belief connects with his famous statement about the unexamined life not being worth living because self-reflection and questioning lead to a deeper understanding of oneself and how to live virtuously according to universal norms or values.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates was known for his wisdom and for claiming to know nothing, so his belief that 'the unexamined life is not worth living' must be related to his own experience of questioning everything and seeking knowledge.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Craig is likely referring to the philosophical concept of infinity, which suggests that an infinite number of things cannot be fully comprehended or realized in reality due to its limitless nature. Therefore, saying an actually infinite number of things exist would contradict this understanding.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Infinity is a complex concept, but it's certainly possible to imagine an endless series of things, so Craig must believe that an actually infinite number of things is possible, even if we can't fully comprehend it.

C,"Let's reason step by step. John Rawls, in his theory of justice as fairness, introduces the concept of an original contract to determine principles that would be chosen under a veil of ignorance. This hypothetical situation ensures impartiality and fairness since no one knows their place in society. The purpose is not merely to enter a particular society or establish government but rather to agree on fundamental justice principles for the basic structure of society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The original contract, as Rawls describes it, is a hypothetical agreement that establishes the foundation of morality and how we should live together, so it must be about establishing the content of morality as a whole. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is to 'establish the content of morality.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Kant, the only thing that is inherently 'good', without qualification or condition, is a 'good will'. This means an intention or motivation behind actions rather than the outcomes of those actions (which rules out options A and B). It also isn't dependent on happiness as he believed moral duty should be followed regardless of personal feelings. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ultimate goal of morality is to achieve happiness and well-being, so Kant must believe that nothing can be called 'good' without qualification except happiness. However, according to Kant, the only thing that is good in itself (without need for any further justification) is a good will. A right action or good consequences are dependent on circumstances and intentions, while happiness could lead one astray from moral duty.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Ideal Moral Code theory focuses on what actions would be required if the ideal moral rules were universally followed and implemented within an institution. It is not about actual, non-ideal settings or a world without institutions but rather envisions how one should act in an idealized context where everyone adheres to these principles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ideal moral code refers to a situation where everyone follows the rules perfectly, so it's about how things should be in an ideal world. Therefore, one is obligated to do what the ideal moral rules would require in a world where everyone complies with those rules.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher and statesman, emphasized the importance of virtue and moral integrity in his works. He believed that following one's conscience was essential for maintaining ethical behavior and making just decisions. Therefore, according to Cicero's philosophy, we will never go morally astray if we follow our conscience.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero believed that morality comes from within, so following our conscience would ensure we never stray from the right path. This aligns with his philosophy of natural law and human rationality.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, a Christian philosopher and theologian, argued that evil is not an entity in itself but rather the absence or privation of good. According to his viewpoint, evil arises when there is a lack of goodness, as it represents a deviation from what should be present.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that evil arises from a lack of positive qualities, so where there's no hatred or negativity, there can be no evil. Among the options given, 'hatred' is most closely associated with negative actions and behaviors which could lead to evil.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Nagel argues in his work on moral luck that individuals cannot be morally assessed for factors beyond their control, as these are external to the individual's actions and decisions. This concept challenges traditional views of moral responsibility.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel suggests that people shouldn't be judged for their inherent character traits before reflection, as these are part of who they are. However, the question is about what cannot be morally assessed prior to reflection. The correct answer should reflect something beyond personal control or awareness. Among the options given, 'what is due to factors beyond their control' best fits this description.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, in his work 'De Officiis', discusses the story of Gyges to illustrate how power can corrupt individuals and lead them to commit unjust acts without fear of punishment. The ring of Gyges grants its wearer the ability to become invisible, thus enabling him to act with impunity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The story Cicero uses to illustrate injustice with impunity must involve a conflict of power and morality, like the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon. However, this story is more about honor than impunity. Icarus' tale involves hubris but not justice or its absence. Oedipus King deals with fate and guilt rather than injustice without consequence. The Ring of Gyges narrative from Plato's Republic directly addresses the question of whether a person would act justly if they could do so with impunity, making it the most fitting example for Cicero to use.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Stevenson, a prominent emotivist philosopher, argued that empirical methods alone cannot resolve ethical disagreements because they are based on subjective feelings and attitudes rather than objective facts. However, he acknowledged the role of empirical evidence in informing our understanding of consequences, which can influence moral judgments. Therefore, while empirical methods have a place in discussions about ethics, they cannot fully resolve disagreements by themselves.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson believed that empirical methods provide the most reliable way to settle ethical disputes, as they rely on objective evidence and observation. However, he also acknowledged that some disagreements may be based on differing fundamental values or emotions, which cannot always be resolved through empirical means alone.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's utilitarianism emphasizes the greatest happiness principle, which suggests that actions should be judged based on their consequences for overall well-being. While he advocated for considering the utility of an action before making a decision, it is not necessary to perform explicit calculations prior to each individual act. Instead, Bentham believed in keeping utilitarian principles in mind as a general guide.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's utilitarianism requires us to calculate the potential outcomes of each action before we act to ensure we maximize happiness. This means that, according to Bentham, utilitarian calculations should be performed prior to each action.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The biblical account of the soul often presents it as an immaterial, spiritual entity distinct from the physical body, which aligns with dualism. A unitary concept of the soul and a monistic soul both imply that there is only one kind or aspect to the soul, not necessarily at odds with the biblical view. The identity theory posits that mental states are identical to brain states, focusing on physicality rather than spirituality.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Bible presents the soul as a single, indivisible entity, which contradicts the idea of a soul separate from the body. Soul-body dualism posits that the mind (or soul) and body are distinct entities, whereas the biblical account treats them as one unified being.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Susan Wolf, in her essay 'Moral Saints', argues that a moral saint is someone whose every action and decision is as morally good as possible. This would likely limit their ability to engage in activities purely for personal enjoyment or amusement, such as reading Victorian novels for pleasure, having sarcastic wit (which could be seen as lacking empathy), or indulging in gourmet cooking solely for self-gratification. Therefore, the correct answer is that a moral saint cannot have all of these interests.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A moral saint, as described by Wolf, is completely devoted to morality and wouldn't engage in frivolous activities like reading novels. They would also avoid sarcasm because it can be hurtful or manipulative, which goes against their commitment to doing good for others. Additionally, a focus on gourmet cooking could potentially conflict with the moral saint's dedication to helping others and reducing suffering.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept that mental states are dispositions to behave in specific ways under certain circumstances aligns with the philosophy of logical behaviorism, which posits that mental states can be defined and understood through observable behaviors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The idea that mental states are linked to observable behaviors is central to methodological behaviorism, which focuses on external actions. Logical behaviorism extends this concept further, suggesting that mental terms can be defined in terms of behavioral dispositions. This aligns with the given description.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kantian ethics is based on deontological principles, which means that morality is determined by adherence to rules or duties rather than consequences (A) or virtues (C). The central concept in Kant's moral philosophy is the 'categorical imperative', which states that one should act only according to maxims that could be willed as universal laws. This eliminates options A, C, and D.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's moral philosophy emphasizes maximizing happiness for everyone, so we should choose actions that lead to the greatest overall good. This is known as utilitarianism and aligns with option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that self-examination was essential for understanding oneself and living a virtuous life. Without examining our actions and beliefs, we cannot truly understand the reasons behind them or determine if they are justified. This lack of knowledge prevents us from making informed decisions about how to live virtuously.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, being a philosopher, believed that those who engaged in philosophical reflection were naturally more virtuous than others. This is because the act of self-examination allows individuals to understand and evaluate their actions, beliefs, and values critically. It helps them discern right from wrong and make informed decisions based on reason rather than blindly following societal norms or personal impulses.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham, as an advocate of utilitarianism, believed in maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain for the greatest number of people. A moral sanction, according to him, is a form of social approval or disapproval that encourages individuals to act morally based on the consequences (pleasure or pain) their actions may cause.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham defined moral sanctions as the punishments or rewards given by a judge based on the laws of the society. These are not inflicted randomly, nor solely permissible actions; they follow established rules and principles.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Writing and reading about research ethics often involve disagreements on what is considered ethically acceptable, recurring debates over long periods, and certain research methods being associated with ethical violations. Therefore, all the options listed contribute to frequent frustrations in this field.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main frustration in research ethics is that writers often have different opinions on what's considered ethical, leading to ongoing debates. These discussions can span decades as new perspectives and cases emerge. Additionally, certain research methods may be more prone to ethical violations than others. Therefore, all the options listed contribute to frustrations in writing or reading about research ethics.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Hobbes, in his political philosophy, defines justice and injustice based on the social contract theory. Injustice occurs when an individual fails to fulfill their obligations or covenants agreed upon within a society. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Hobbes defines injustice as 'failure to perform one’s covenant.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. Injustice, according to Hobbes, occurs when someone takes more than their fair share of resources or benefits. This is because in his social contract theory, individuals agree to give up some freedoms and submit to authority (the sovereign) in exchange for protection and the preservation of order. Taking more than one's share disrupts this balance and violates the agreed-upon rules.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato is discussing how hypothetical knowledge relies on general concepts that are not explained themselves and cannot provide a secure foundation for dialectical knowledge. Dialectics goes directly to the first principle without using hypotheses, making it more reliable in understanding absolute truth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that hypotheses help us connect our sense experiences with innate ideas, but they don't provide a secure foundation for knowledge. Dialectics, on the other hand, goes directly to first principles and eliminates the need for hypotheses. Therefore, in this context, hypotheses simply explain sense experiences in terms of general concepts which themselves are not explained.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. W. D. Ross, in his ethical theory, uses the analogy of prima facie duties to explain that these are like initial obligations we have until further information or circumstances might override them. This concept is similar to how laws work within a nation; they provide guidelines and rules but can be overridden by more pressing moral considerations in specific situations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ross compared prima facie duties to the laws of a country, which provide a basic framework for moral obligations but can be overridden in certain situations. This analogy helps illustrate that while these duties are generally binding, they may not always apply due to conflicting circumstances.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Annette Baier, a moral philosopher, emphasizes that genuine moral rules should not only consider the interests of human beings but also take into account all sentient beings capable of experiencing pleasure or pain. This perspective aligns with her broader ethical views on care and interdependence among living creatures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Baier argued that true moral rules consider the well-being of all living things, not just humans, as all life has inherent value. This perspective extends beyond human interests and includes sentient beings capable of experiencing pain or pleasure.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. J.S. Mill, a proponent of utilitarianism, acknowledged that one of the strongest objections to this ethical theory is related to actions that go beyond duty or obligation (supererogatory acts). Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall happiness and may not adequately account for these morally praiseworthy but non-obligatory actions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. One of the main criticisms of utilitarianism is that it doesn't account for supererogatory actions, which go above and beyond what's morally expected. These are acts of extreme virtue or sacrifice that aren't required but still considered good. Mill acknowledges this as a strong objection to utilitarianism.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, a prominent philosopher and mathematician, proposed that the fundamental characteristic of physical things is their ability to occupy space or 'extension'. This concept was central to his philosophy, distinguishing between mind (res cogitans) which does not have extension, and body (res extensa), which has extension. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this idea.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes believed that physical things, unlike mental things, cannot be measured or quantified because they lack clear boundaries. However, he did argue that physical things possess a property called 'extension', which means they occupy space and have dimensions such as length, width, and depth.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley, a philosopher known for his theory of immaterialism, argued that physical objects do not exist independently of the mind and that all qualities we perceive are dependent on perception. He believed heat and cold to be sensations existing in our minds rather than independent entities.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley believed that reality is ultimately mental, so sensations like heat and cold must be illusions created by our minds. He argued against the existence of material substances independent of perception.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century philosopher, is known for his work on political philosophy and social contract theory. His view of human nature was quite pessimistic; he believed that in the state of nature, humans are driven by selfishness and desire for power. The laws of nature according to Hobbes aim at preserving peace and preventing conflict. Among the given options, 'do not do to another what you would not have done to yourself' is closest to his idea of reciprocity in social contracts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believed that individuals act in their self-interest, so the guiding principle of natural law would be to maximize happiness for oneself and society. This aligns with his view on social contract theory where people agree to give up some freedoms for protection and order.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Peter Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. He believes that famine relief organizations are capable of directing aid more effectively than individuals could on their own due to their expertise and infrastructure in place for such situations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues for effective altruism, so he likely believes that donating to distant refugees through organizations is inefficient and not worthwhile compared to helping those closer to home. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be that these organizations direct aid very inefficiently.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes, in his philosophical approach known as Cartesian doubt, sought to find an indubitable foundation for knowledge. He famously stated 'Cogito, ergo sum', which translates to 'I think, therefore I am'. This statement implies that the act of thinking itself is proof of one's existence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes famously doubted everything, even his own senses. Therefore, the fact that he is thinking could simply mean he is dreaming. However, in his philosophical argument known as 'Cogito ergo sum', Descartes concluded that if he was doubting or thinking about anything at all, then there must be a thinker doing so. This led him to assert that even the act of doubt proves existence.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'logos' in philosophy represents rational discourse and reasoning about the world and experiences, while 'mythos' signifies a narrative or story that explains phenomena without necessarily relying on empirical evidence. Philosophy often seeks to provide logical explanations for our existence and reality; however, it may implicitly rely on certain foundational beliefs or assumptions (a mythos) as starting points for reasoning. Therefore, the answer is A.",A,Let's reason step by step. Philosophers often try to appear more credible by using complex language and obscure references. This reliance on mythos is essentially a way to disguise their lack of concrete evidence. The most appropriate answer reflects this idea that philosophy may use mythos as a tool for legitimacy.,B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that explores the nature and appreciation of beauty, art, and taste. It does not necessarily deal with objects essential to our existence or their importance to people but rather focuses on the perception and value we assign to things based on their appearance and form. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that aesthetics deals with objects that are 'not essential to our existence'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics deals with beauty and art, which are fundamental to human expression, cultural development, and our understanding of the world. Therefore, aesthetics deals with objects essential to our existence. The correct answer is 'essential to our existence'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, an empiricist philosopher, argued that beauty is not a property inherent to objects but rather exists in the mind of the observer. According to him, our perception and experience determine what we consider beautiful, making it subjective. Therefore, he would argue that beauty has no quality in things themselves.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Beauty is not arbitrary; there are clear criteria and principles that determine what is considered beautiful, such as symmetry, proportion, and harmony. Therefore, beauty can be judged by logical standards. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question 'Is there anything you would be willing to die for?' prompts individuals to reflect on their values, priorities, and ethical principles. It requires introspection and justification of deeply held beliefs about what is worth sacrificing one's life for. This process involves articulating knowledge and moral reasoning rather than focusing solely on religious or factual claims.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The question of dying for something is deeply personal and varies widely based on individual beliefs and values. Therefore, it cannot be a truly philosophical question as it doesn't have a single, universally applicable answer. It forces us to articulate our own unique perspectives rather than engaging with broader philosophical concepts or theories.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. If our individual perception is limited to an internal perspective and there's no access to an external or 'real' world for comparison, then determining the usefulness, truthfulness, or value of that perspective becomes problematic. The only way we could evaluate our own perspective would be through appealing to some standard within it itself, which creates a circular argument.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If we are limited to an internal perspective, we can only compare our perceptions to the ""real"" world to determine their accuracy. Without an external reference point, we cannot judge the usefulness or truth of our perspective. Therefore, option A is correct as it highlights the need for comparison with an objective reality.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. G.E.M. Anscombe criticizes J.L. Mackie's argument from queerness, which includes the idea that moral properties are objective and intrinsically motivating. She argues against deriving an 'ought' from an 'is', stating that it is a category mistake to derive normative statements (what ought to be) directly from descriptive statements (what is). This criticism aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe likely disagreed with Butler's emphasis on pleasure as a guiding principle for morality, arguing that the concept of pleasure is subjective and unreliable. This critique aligns with her broader philosophical views about ethics being grounded in objective reasons rather than individual feelings or desires.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that myth is not a product of rational thought but rather it shapes our understanding of reason itself. This implies that the relationship between things in myth does not rely on logical explanation, but instead reveals their interconnectedness inherently.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that myth and reason are essentially the same thing, with each concept defining and shaping the other in a cyclical manner. Myth is not just an explanation but rather reveals relationships as they inherently exist. Therefore, the answer should reflect this interdependence between myth and reason.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier is a philosopher known for his work in moral philosophy and practical rationality, which involves reasoning about what one ought to do. Among the options provided, deliberative justification aligns most closely with this concept as it pertains to reasons that justify actions or beliefs based on their coherence within an individual's set of beliefs and goals.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier likely believes that practical rationality is ultimately grounded in moral principles, as our actions should be guided by ethical considerations and a sense of right and wrong. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be 'moral justification'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a prominent philosopher and theologian, proposed that all actions are directed towards an ultimate goal or 'end'. This is known as his theory of final causality in which every action has a purpose or end it seeks to achieve.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that individuals are naturally inclined to act in their self-interest, seeking to maximize their own well-being and happiness as the ultimate end of their actions. This concept is rooted in his understanding of human nature and purpose.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, a classical Greek philosopher, believed that the soul is harmed when it lacks knowledge because he thought ignorance was the root of all evil and suffering. The pursuit of wisdom and understanding was central to his philosophy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasized the importance of self-reflection and individual pursuit of knowledge. He likely believed that excessive involvement in community affairs could distract from this pursuit and harm the soul. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a lack of community.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Art is a form of expression that often represents ideas, emotions, or the world around us through various mediums such as painting, sculpture, music, etc. It does not directly relate to wealth, utility in a practical sense, or well-being (although it can contribute to these). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is representation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Art has historically served various purposes, such as communication, education, and even religious or political propaganda. Therefore, its traditional definition likely emphasizes its utility and practical function in society. Among the given options, 'utility' best captures this aspect of art.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Martha Nussbaum, as a philosopher and ethicist, has argued extensively on issues related to sexuality and morality. Her perspective often emphasizes that moral debates should be grounded in virtues rather than rigid rules or cultural norms. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that our modern debates about homosexuality are carried out in a manner that may not always align with virtue ethics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the long history of philosophical and ethical discussions on sexuality, our modern debates about homosexuality are likely continuations of the same arguments and concerns present in ancient Greek society. This perspective aligns with Nussbaum's views on the historical context of moral disputes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham, the founder of modern utilitarianism, proposed that actions should be judged based on their utility or usefulness in promoting happiness and reducing suffering for the greatest number of people. This principle applies not only to individuals but also to governments as they make policies affecting society at large.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's principle of utility focuses on maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. This suggests its application is primarily relevant to governments and policymakers who make decisions affecting large populations. However, individuals can also apply this principle in their personal decision-making processes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Thomas Aquinas, every action is directed towards an end or a purpose that the agent desires as being good in itself. This aligns with his teleological view of ethics where actions are judged based on their ultimate goal or 'end'. Therefore, the most appropriate answer reflecting Aquinas' argument would be that the end of every action is some form of good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that human actions are driven by desires and emotions. Therefore, the ultimate end of every action is likely an emotional state, such as happiness, satisfaction, or peace. This aligns with his theory of final causes in which everything has a purpose or goal.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Nagel discusses moral luck as a paradox where individuals are held morally responsible for actions and consequences influenced by factors beyond their control, which challenges the concept of free will. The problem of moral luck is thus closely connected to questions about whether our choices can be considered truly free if they're affected by external circumstances.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The problem of moral luck deals with the influence of external factors on our moral responsibility. This is closely related to the problem of universals, as it questions whether there are universal moral principles applicable to all situations. Nagel argues that if morality depends on circumstances beyond one's control (moral luck), then it challenges the idea of objective moral standards or universals.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that all created things are inherently good because they come from God, who is perfectly good. However, he also acknowledged that evil exists due to human free will and the misuse of creations. Therefore, while individual creations can be used for both good and evil purposes, their essence remains good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed in a benevolent God who created a perfect world. Therefore, all created things must be eternally and unchangeably good, reflecting the divine nature of their origin. This aligns with his philosophical and theological views.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham was a philosopher and social reformer who is known for his work on utilitarianism, which suggests that the rightness or wrongness of actions depends on their consequences rather than divine command. Therefore, he would argue against basing morality solely on God's will.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's focus on maximizing happiness suggests that morality is independent of religious beliefs, implying that God's will and moral rightness are separate domains. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this separation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes, in his work 'Leviathan', describes the state of nature as a condition where there is no authority or government to enforce laws and order. In this state, individuals have natural rights to preserve their own lives, which includes doing anything necessary for self-preservation. Therefore, every man has a right to everything.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In a state of war, there's an absence of governing authority, but individuals still retain inherent rights, such as the right to lawful treatment and protection from harm.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that a good life could be achieved with simple pleasures, friendship, and philosophical contemplation rather than material wealth or luxury. He emphasized that happiness comes from within and not from external possessions. Therefore, the correct answer is that the wealth required for a good life according to Epicurus is easily procured.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that true happiness comes from simple pleasures, but attaining these pleasures often requires hard work and dedication, making a good life accessible only through great effort. Therefore, the wealth required for a good life is not easily procured or limited to specific groups.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Derek Parfit argues that while we can compare pains within an individual (e.g., one pain being more intense than another), it is not possible to make precise comparisons of the magnitude of pain between different individuals due to subjective experiences and lack of a common standard.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's skepticism about interpersonal comparisons of utility suggests that pain is subjective and cannot be objectively measured or compared between individuals or even within the same individual over time. Therefore, he would argue against precise or rough comparison.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A Loving Saint, as described by philosopher Thomas Aquinas, is someone who experiences a profound love for God and others that leads them to seek the ultimate good in all things. This kind of love naturally results in their happiness being intertwined with the well-being of others because they see the goodness in helping and loving others as part of their own fulfillment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A Loving Saint prioritizes morality above all else, dedicating their life to serving others and neglecting their own happiness in the pursuit of moral perfection. This concept aligns with the idea that a saintly figure would place the well-being of others before their own personal joy or desires.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas argued that an infinite regress of causes is not possible because it would mean there was no first cause, which contradicts his belief in a necessary being (God) as the ultimate cause. Therefore, according to Aquinas, an infinite regress of causes is impossible.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas argues for the existence of a first cause, God, which implies that the chain of causes must have a beginning and is therefore finite, not infinite. An infinite regress would mean there is no ultimate or necessary being to initiate causation.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. An important moral criterion of adequacy should align with and reflect well-considered, deeply held moral beliefs that have been subject to reflection and deliberation. Among the given options, consistency with our considered moral judgments best fits this description as it ensures a moral theory is in harmony with what we intuitively find morally right or wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A good moral theory should acknowledge the limitations of human knowledge and be open to revisions as new information or perspectives emerge, hence, fallibility is a crucial criterion for adequacy. It ensures that our ethical beliefs are not dogmatic but rather adaptable.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Before his conversion, Leo Tolstoy was surrounded by wealth and privilege as a member of the Russian nobility. This lifestyle would have been associated with comfort and luxury rather than hardship or lack. Therefore, none of the options directly describe his pre-conversion life accurately. However, option A ('what is considered complete happiness') could be interpreted to reflect Tolstoy's initial state before he experienced a profound spiritual crisis that led him to seek deeper meaning in life.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy's depiction of his early life suggests a pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and a yearning for heavenly bliss, which he ultimately found through his religious conversion. The other options do not align with the context of Tolstoy's transformation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume, a Scottish philosopher, argued that morality is based on human sentiment and emotion rather than pure rationality or objective facts. He believed that our moral judgments are derived from feelings of approval (virtue) or disapproval (vice), which he referred to as 'moral sentiments'. Therefore, the correct answer reflects Hume's emphasis on emotions in moral decision-making.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hume's theory of moral sentiments suggests that moral judgments are based on individual feelings and emotions, implying that each person possesses a unique moral sense that shapes their ethical views.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy primarily deals with understanding human existence, evaluating arguments supporting those beliefs, and addressing fundamental questions about life. The two main driving questions in philosophy revolve around the meaning of concepts (what do you mean?) and justification or knowledge acquisition (how do you know?).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy is concerned with understanding how philosophers construct arguments and evaluate the validity of their reasoning, as well as exploring the implications of different philosophical perspectives. The two questions that best summarize these activities are: 'how do philosophers argue?' which addresses argument construction, and 'are their differences important?', which pertains to evaluating the significance of varying beliefs.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore defines the naturalistic fallacy as the mistaken belief that moral properties can be reduced to or defined in terms of natural properties, such as pleasure or desire. This means equating 'good' with a natural property is an example of this fallacy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The naturalistic fallacy encompasses the idea that what is natural is good, that what is good is natural, and that 'good' can be defined in terms of natural properties. Therefore, Moore defines it as all these views combined.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Aquinas\u2019s philosophy, prudence is considered the cardinal virtue that guides moral virtues and practical reasoning. It involves making wise decisions based on ethical considerations rather than personal pleasure or desire. Therefore, acts of prudence are primarily about matters of moral virtue.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas views prudence as a virtue concerned with making wise choices that lead to personal happiness and fulfillment, aligning it with the pursuit of pleasure. However, in his philosophy, prudence is not solely about matters of pleasure but rather involves practical wisdom for discerning right action.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues against reducing Kantian ethics to a finite set of constraints, as it would oversimplify the complexity and richness of moral life. Among the given options, placing an 'upper bound' on moral worthiness aligns with this critique because it suggests that there is a limit to how morally good one can be within such a simplified framework.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If Kant's ethics were limited to a finite set of rules, achieving moral sainthood would become a simple matter of following those rules, resulting in a rather uninspiring and mundane ideal. This interpretation could potentially undermine the depth and complexity that is often associated with Kantian morality.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham, in his utilitarian philosophy, defines fecundity as the likelihood that a particular pleasure or pain will lead to more of the same sensation. It is not about how intense it feels (B), its duration (D), or just its chance of occurring (A). Therefore, the correct answer reflects this concept.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's concept of fecundity refers to the likelihood of a pleasure or pain leading to similar sensations in the future, essentially, its chance of occurring repeatedly. This is different from intensity (degree felt), duration (how long it lasts), and probability (chance of occurrence).",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy is concerned with expressing and justifying beliefs through clear language, reasoning, and addressing objections. This process involves articulating the meaning of our beliefs and providing arguments to support them.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy seeks to construct and refine conceptual frameworks that align with religious beliefs, using clear language and logical arguments to support these frameworks and promote a specific ideology. This process involves articulating the meaning behind our beliefs and justifying them through reasoning.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's rule-utilitarianism is an ethical theory that suggests the rightness or wrongness of actions should be determined based on whether they adhere to rules that, if followed consistently, would lead to the greatest good for the greatest number. This approach focuses on establishing normative guidelines for behavior rather than describing how people actually behave (metaethics) or merely reporting facts about moral beliefs and practices (descriptive ethics). Therefore, Brandt's rule-utilitarianism is best described as a normative ethical thesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's rule-utilitarianism is primarily concerned with describing how people actually make moral decisions based on rules and social norms, rather than prescribing how they should act. It focuses on the psychological processes behind ethical decision-making, making it a descriptive thesis.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Singer, known for his work on global poverty and famine relief, argues that the consequences of not providing aid are morally unacceptable regardless of potential long-term effects like overpopulation. He emphasizes our moral obligation to help those in need now rather than focusing on hypothetical future outcomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues that the claim that famine relief causes overpopulation is empirically unfounded, as studies have shown no direct correlation between aid efforts and population growth. Therefore, he would likely assert that this argument against providing famine relief is not supported by evidence.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, emphasized the distinction between things within our control (our own thoughts, feelings, and actions) and those outside of it (external events). He believed that we should focus on what is in our power to change while accepting what is not. Therefore, things within our power are 'free and unhindered', as they can be controlled by us without obstacles; whereas things not in our power are subject to external influences and thus 'servile and subject to hindrance'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that external events and circumstances are beyond our control and subject to hindrance, while our thoughts and judgments are within our power and free from external constraints. Therefore, things not in our power would be 'servile and subject to hindrance', whereas things within our power would be 'free and unhindered'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Baier argues that for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, it must be part of the mores (shared beliefs and practices) of the group, universally teachable so everyone can learn and understand it, and not merely a taboo which implies social disapproval but doesn't necessarily carry moral weight. Therefore, all these conditions are necessary for a rule to belong to the morality of a group.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a rule to be considered part of a group's morality, it must be universally teachable, meaning it can be effectively taught and understood by all members of the group regardless of their background or beliefs. It should also not merely be a taboo but have deeper moral significance. Additionally, being part of the mores (customary norms) indicates that it is an established practice within the group's culture. Therefore, for a rule to belong to the morality of a group, all these conditions must be met.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill argues that utilitarianism cannot be proven from self-evident or empirical principles because it is a fundamental principle itself. Instead, he suggests that the principle of utility can only be accepted based on its inherent appeal and practical consequences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill acknowledges that the principle of utility cannot be definitively proven, which is a fundamental flaw of the theory and sets it apart from other ethical frameworks with more solid foundations. This characteristic makes option C the most accurate choice.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Charles Stevenson, the word 'good' has an emotive meaning that evokes a positive feeling or reaction in people. This pleasing emotional response is most fitting for situations where we want to express approval or praise, which aligns with constructive use.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a word has a pleasing emotive meaning, it's best suited for describing things in a positive light, making it ideal for descriptive use. Stevenson's theory of emotivism suggests that ethical terms like 'good' express the speaker's feelings and attitudes rather than objective properties.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Multiple personality disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), involves the presence of two or more distinct identities within a single individual. This suggests that the mind can exhibit different states or 'personalities,' which implies divisibility in its functioning.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has multiple personalities, it suggests their core identity is fragmented and therefore, the existence of a unified mind is a delusion. This aligns with option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier, in his work on moral philosophy and contractarianism, emphasizes the importance of deliberative justification as a process where individuals consider various reasons for their actions or beliefs to reach rational decisions. He argues that this form of justification inherently involves taking into account all relevant considerations, making it comprehensive rather than incomplete.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If deliberative justification is incomplete, it means the definition is too narrow, so Gauthier likely expands the definition to encompass more considerations. Therefore, he would argue that deliberative justification takes account of all relevant considerations.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's Republic, Thrasymachus argues that justice is defined by those in power and serves their interests. He believes that rulers make laws to benefit themselves, thus making 'justice' whatever they say it is for their own advantage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Thrasymachus, being a philosopher concerned with societal order, likely believed that justice is ultimately determined by the will and desires of the gods. In this context, his view would be that justice consists in doing what pleases them.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical skepticism questions the existence or knowability of moral truths, which is primarily an epistemological issue rather than metaphysical, religious, or scientific ones. Baier would argue that confusion in understanding how we come to know ethical principles leads to skepticism about their validity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical skepticism involves doubting the validity of moral claims, which aligns with the questioning and revision of theories in scientific fields. Baier would likely argue that ethical skepticism arises from misunderstandings or misapplications within a specific domain related to knowledge acquisition.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for his utilitarian approach, which focuses on the consequences of actions to determine their moral value. According to Sidgwick, an action is right if it promotes the greatest happiness or utility. Therefore, the badness of an action must be estimated based on its expected outcomes rather than actual results, duties, or divine law.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sidgwick's ethical framework emphasizes the importance of consequences, so the badness of an action would naturally be judged based on its actual, real-world outcomes. Anscombe critiques this viewpoint and argues that it neglects moral principles or duties in favor of a purely consequentialist approach.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's terminology suggests that for a moral code to have currency in a society, it must be widely accepted or recognized as the standard set of principles guiding behavior within that society. This implies both widespread subscription among adults and recognition as the societal norm.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For a moral code to have currency, it must be inherently valuable and true, regardless of whether it's widely accepted or recognized by society. Brandt emphasizes the importance of rational acceptability rather than mere popularity or recognition.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher, believed that pleasure is the highest good and key to a happy life. However, he emphasized simple pleasures like friendship over materialistic ones such as honor or luxury. Among all things required for a complete life according to him, friendship was considered the greatest because it provides emotional support, companionship, and happiness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, known for advocating a life of pleasure and virtue, likely believed that honor and recognition from others were essential for a fulfilling life. However, his philosophy emphasized the importance of simple pleasures and meaningful relationships over material wealth or physical indulgence.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The two principal answers to whether life has any meaning for us are often framed in terms of perspectives on existence: one that looks at life from an external, objective standpoint and another that considers the subjective experience and personal significance. These can be referred to as the 'external view' and the 'internal view'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The question of life's meaning often revolves around the existence of a higher power, so the two main answers would likely involve theistic and agnostic viewpoints. Atheists or non-religious individuals might argue that life has no inherent meaning (agnostic), while those who believe in God(s) may find purpose through their faith (theistic).",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Indeterminism is the concept that not all events are determined or predestined, and there can be multiple possible outcomes for a given situation. This implies that the world has ambiguous possibilities rather than a fixed future or no turning points.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Indeterminism suggests that events are predetermined and inevitable, meaning the world has a fixed future with no room for alternative possibilities. Therefore, the correct answer is 'a fixed future'.",B
