This is true even if the original population is not normally distributed. Therefore, option C accurately describes the central limit theorem.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem tells us that the sample mean will get closer and closer to the population mean as we increase the sample size, regardless of the population distribution.

D,"Let's reason step by step. At the end of the first year, 80% (100 - 20%) of the initial 100 workers remain, which is 80 workers. In the second year, only 5% of these remaining workers leave, so 95% stay. Therefore, we expect 95% of 80 workers to still be on the job at the end of the second year: 0.95 * 80 = 76 workers from the first group. Adding this to the new batch of 100 hired in the second year gives us a total expected number of 76 + 100 = 176 workers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. After the first year, 20% of the 200 workers will have left, leaving 160. Then, 5% of these remaining workers will leave, so we expect 160 - (0.05 * 160) = 152 workers to be on the job at the end of the second year. Therefore, option C is correct.",C

C,"Let's reason step by step. Residuals are differences between observed and predicted values from a regression model. Statement A refers to influential points but not all of them have large residuals. Statement B is incorrect because the number of positive and negative residuals does not necessarily need to be equal for a good linear model. Statement D is also incorrect as no pattern in residuals would suggest that there's no relationship, which contradicts having zero correlation. The correct statement is C: In an ideal regression model, the mean of the residuals should be zero because this indicates that the model does not systematically over or under-predict.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the linear model is a good fit for the data, then the residuals should be balanced around the regression line, meaning there should be roughly the same number of positive and negative residuals. This ensures that the model does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the response variable.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. Continuous data can take any value within a range, while discrete data consists of distinct values. I (car speed) is continuous as it can vary continuously; II (binomial outcomes) and V (jersey numbers) are discrete because they have specific countable values; III (average temperature) is also continuous since temperatures can be measured with precision; IV (wingspan of a bird) is continuous for the same reason. Therefore, I, III, and IV represent examples of continuous data.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Continuous data can take on any value within a range.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean, while a larger one means they are more spread out. Set I has three numbers with moderate variance; Set II has two numbers far apart from each other and the mean; Set III consists of only one number, which implies no variation at all (standard deviation is 0). Therefore, Set III has the smallest standard deviation, and Set II has the largest.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Set III has the smallest standard deviation because it only has one value, so there's no variation. Set I has the largest standard deviation because its values are more spread out than in Set II. Therefore, the correct answer is C: III (smallest), I (largest).",C

A census involves collecting data from every member of a population, which makes it most appropriate for small populations where such comprehensive data collection is feasible. Among the options given, option B refers to determining the proportion of students in a small town taking AP classes, making it suitable for a census approach as the population size (students in a small town) is likely manageable.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given equation is ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42x, and we need to find the predicted value of y when x=7. First, substitute x with 7: ln(y) = 3.2 + (0.42 * 7). Then calculate the right side: ln(y) = 6.14. To get y, take the exponential of both sides: y = e^6.14. The predicted value of y is approximately 464.05.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plugging x = 7 into the equation gives ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42 * 7 = 6.14. Therefore, the predicted value of y is 6.14. To find this in terms of y rather than ln(y), we need to take e^(ln(y)) which simplifies to just y. So, y = e^6.14.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. While a complete census, a least squares regression line with high correlation, and a simple random sample can provide valuable information about relationships between variables, they do not establish causation.

A complete census provides data on the entire population, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of relationships between variables and therefore establishing cause-and-effect. However, it does not necessarily imply causation. A least squares regression line showing high correlation indicates a strong relationship but doesn't prove causality due to potential confounding factors. A simple random sample (SRS) is useful for generalizing results from a sample to the population but also doesn't establish cause-and-effect relationships directly. An experiment, on the other hand, involves manipulating one variable and observing changes in another while controlling extraneous variables, which allows researchers to infer causality.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The researcher uses a random page and then selects the next 75 names, which introduces chance into the selection process but does not ensure that every individual has an equal probability of being selected due to potential clustering within pages or non-random distribution of long distance carriers among phone numbers. This could lead to selection bias.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The phone book is naturally divided into sections by the first letter of the last name, creating 26 strata.

The statement 'The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed' accurately reflects the purpose and interpretation of a confidence interval.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat this sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true proportion of students with the correct address on record.

B,"Let's reason step by step. A binomial model is appropriate when there are only two possible outcomes for each trial, and the trials are independent with constant probability.

However, option B involves more than two outcomes (rainy or not rainy), making it unsuitable for a binomial model.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The number of students present in a class is a count of individuals, with each student either present or absent. This is similar to the other options, so a binomial model is appropriate. However, the key difference lies in whether there are only two possible outcomes (success/failure) and if these probabilities remain constant across trials. In this case, factors like illness, personal choice, or external events can affect attendance unpredictably, making it not suitable for a binomial model.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile). For a normal distribution, these correspond to approximately -0.6745 and 0.6745 standard deviations from the mean respectively. Multiplying these by the given standard deviation of 18,000 square feet gives us an approximate range of 23,930 square feet (lower quartile) and 123,930 square feet (upper quartile).

The interquartile range covers the middle 50% of the data. In a normal distribution, we can find this range by adding and subtracting 1.5 times the standard deviation from the mean.

This allows researchers to isolate the effects of the treatment and determine its efficacy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The control group should experience the opposite conditions of the experimental group to effectively isolate the effect of the treatment being studied. Option A suggests an opposing treatment, which is not necessary for a valid control. Option B implies deception, which isn't required in scientific experiments.

A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the lead levels are within the allowed limit.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the total weight is found using the formula for combining independent random variables: sqrt(sum_of_variances).

The standard deviation of the total weight is simply the sum of the standard deviations of the books, boxes, and packing material, which is 2 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 2.4 pounds.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Central Limit Theorem, when random samples are drawn from any population (regardless of its shape), the sampling distribution of sample means will be approximately normal if the sample size is large enough. In this case, a sample size of 16 can be considered sufficiently large for the theorem to apply. The mean of the sampling distribution remains the same as the population mean (210 mg/dL). However, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (\u03c3\u0304) is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size: \u03c3\u0304 = 15 / sqrt(16) = 15 / 4 = 3.75 mg/dL.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the population distribution, with the same mean and standard deviation.

The law of large numbers suggests that over many trials, the proportion of even and odd numbers will even out.

The margin of error indicates that if we were to conduct multiple polls using the same methodology, about 95% of them would produce a sample proportion within the specified range (±3.2 percentage points) around the reported value (43%).

Since the empirical rule states that 95% of values in a normal distribution are within 1 standard deviation from the mean, then we expect 95% of 400 employees to have an income between $16,750 and $24,250. However, since $13,000 is more than one standard deviation below the mean and $28,000 is less than two standard deviations above the mean, we can estimate that a slightly higher percentage of employees will fall within this range.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 50 percent of a normal distribution corresponds to the interquartile range (IQR), which is between the first quartile (25th percentile) and third quartile (75th percentile).

Multiplying these by the given standard deviation of 320 and adding/subtracting them from the mean gives us: Lower limit = 3,250 - (0.6745 * 320) = 3,034; Upper limit = 3,250 + (0.6745 * 320) = 3,466.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that in a normal distribution, the middle 50% of values are within 1 standard deviation from the mean. So the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is between 2,930 and 3,570.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis in a statistical test typically assumes no difference or relationship between groups being compared.

Therefore, increasing the number of experimental units would increase the power and keep the Type I error rate unchanged.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Looking up this z-score in a standard normal distribution table or using a calculator gives us a probability of about 0.9869 that the demand will be less than or equal to 3,000 loaves.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A Type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis (false positive), while a Type II error happens when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative). These errors are independent of each other, and it is not possible to make both simultaneously in the same test decision. The probability of a Type II error does depend on factors like sample size and effect size but not directly on the probability of a Type I error. A Type II error isn't about assuming data distribution; rather, it's related to failing to detect an actual effect or difference when one exists. When setting a significance level (α), we are indeed determining the threshold for how much evidence is needed before rejecting the null hypothesis and thus directly controlling the probability of making a Type I error.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the data actually doesn't follow a normal distribution.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error in a confidence interval is influenced by the sample standard deviation, sample size, and confidence level.

With a 5% significance level and 100 cards, the subject needs to correctly guess at least 95 cards to demonstrate ESP, as this would exceed the expected number of correct guesses by chance. The binomial distribution can be used to calculate the probability of guessing more than half (i.e., 50) correctly by chance alone. Using a normal approximation for large sample sizes and setting the significance level at 0.05, we find that the subject needs to score higher than approximately 67 correct guesses to show significant results. However, since none of the options match this value exactly, the closest option is B (59), which would still be considered significantly better than chance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. For independent random variables X and Y, the mean of their sum is the sum of their means (\u03bc_X + \u03bc_Y), which equals 32 + 44 = 76. The standard deviation of their sum is the square root of the sum of their variances (since they are independent). Variance for X is (\u03c3x)^2 and for Y is (\u03c3y)^2, so \u03c3_X+Y = sqrt((5^2) + (12^2)) = sqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = 13.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the variables are independent, the mean of their sum is simply the sum of their means, and the same applies to the standard deviation. Therefore, \u03bcx+y = \u03bcx + \u03bcy = 32 + 44 = 76. For the standard deviation, we use the formula for independent variables: \u03c3x+y = sqrt(\u03c3x^2 + \u03c3y^2) = sqrt(5^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = 13.

We need to compare the means of two independent samples, so we should calculate the difference between each pair of salaries and then apply a one-sample z-test on this set of differences.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A narrower confidence interval is achieved with a larger sample size, as it reduces the standard error of the estimate.

The width of a confidence interval is determined by its confidence level and standard error; higher confidence levels result in wider intervals to account for more uncertainty. Therefore, a 95 percent confidence interval will be wider than a 90 percent confidence interval.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A higher confidence level, like 95%, demands a more precise estimate, so the interval needs to be narrower to capture the true population parameter with greater accuracy.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the confidence level, we need to calculate the standard error (SE) and z-score for the given range of average building times.

For a confidence interval, we need to find the z-scores corresponding to the lower and upper bounds (z1 for 80 days and z2 for 90 days), and use them to calculate the confidence level.

Adding and subtracting this margin of error from the sample mean (83 days), we get a confidence interval of approximately [75.5, 90.5] days.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct statement about hypothesis testing is that it involves determining whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition holds for the entire population. Option A is incorrect because rejecting at 10% does not guarantee rejection at 5%. Option B is also incorrect as the decision between one- or two-sided tests should be made before collecting data based on the research question.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the union of two events, P(A \u222a B), does not imply independence; it simply represents the likelihood that either event occurs. Statement A is incorrect. For statement B, if P(A \u222a B) = 1, this means one or both events are certain to occur but doesn't necessarily mean they are mutually exclusive. Statement C is also incorrect because independence does not imply a zero intersection probability; independent events can still intersect.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a test, which is given as 0.8, represents the probability of correctly rejecting H0 when Ha is true (1 - Type II error rate).

The power of the test tells us the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, if the power is 0.8, the probability of a Type II error is 0.3.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the sample size for a confidence interval, we can use the formula n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the estimated proportion of success (0.5 if unknown), and E is half the width of the desired confidence interval. For a 90% confidence level, the z-score is approximately 1.645. Assuming no prior knowledge about the proportion in favor, we use p = 0.5 for maximum variability. Thus, n = (1.645^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / (0.08/2)^2 ≈ 63.79. Since sample size must be a whole number and it's better to overestimate than underestimate for accuracy, we round up to the nearest whole number.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need a 90% confidence interval, so the z-score is 1.645. The formula for the confidence interval width is z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n), so we can solve for n using the given width of 0.08. Assuming p=0.5 (maximum variability) to get a conservative estimate, we have: 0.08 = 1.645 * sqrt((0.5)(0.5)/n). Solving this equation gives n approximately equal to 106.",C

For 194 ohms: (194 - 200) / 5 = -1.2; for 188 ohms: (188 - 200) / 5 = -2.4. Using a z-table, we find the probabilities corresponding to these z-scores are approximately 0.1151 and 0.0082 respectively. The probability that a resistor has resistance between 194 ohms and 188 ohms is the difference of these two probabilities: 0.1151 - 0.0082 = 0.1069, which rounds to approximately 0.12.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem. However, means are not always normally distributed, so we use t instead.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample ensures that every member of a population has an equal chance of being selected, which is determined by the method of selection rather than examining outcomes or representativeness. Therefore, the defining characteristic of a simple random sample lies in how individuals are chosen.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is determined by how well it represents the population and the characteristics observed in the sample data.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In experimental design, replication refers to repeating the experiment multiple times to ensure reliability and accuracy of results. This helps in reducing variability due to random chance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Levels and treatments are essentially the same thing, as they both refer to the different conditions or groups that are being compared in an experiment. Factors are independent variables, not response variables (which would be dependent). Replication does involve repeating experiments but is more about having multiple observations under the same condition rather than just repetition for accuracy. Experimental units and subjects can sometimes overlap, but experimental units refer to any entity to which a treatment is applied, while subjects specifically refer to human participants in an experiment.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables and does not depend on their units. Converting height from inches to centimeters involves multiplying by a constant factor (2.54), which doesn't change the correlation coefficient.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting inches to centimeters involves multiplying by a positive constant, which will reverse the direction of the correlation, making it negative. However, since both variables are being scaled in the same way (height and weight), the strength of their relationship remains unchanged.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2-sample t-test is designed to compare means between two independent groups when sample data are available. In this case, the business manager has used all engineers from both offices in his computation, meaning he did not take a sample but rather analyzed the entire population of each group. Therefore, using a t-test would be inappropriate since it is meant for samples.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2-sample t-test is specifically designed for comparing the means of two small groups, making it suitable for this situation with limited engineers in each office.

D,"Let's reason step by step. For two events to be independent, the probability of their intersection should equal the product of their individual probabilities: P(E \u2229 F) = P(E) * P(F). Here, 0.048 is not equal to 0.32 * 0.15 (which equals 0.048), so E and F are independent. For two events to be mutually exclusive, their intersection should have a probability of zero: P(E \u2229 F) = 0. Since the given intersection is not zero, they are not mutually exclusive.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the probability of E and F occurring together is not zero, it means they are not mutually exclusive. And because they have a non-zero intersection, they must also be independent. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that events E and F are independent but not mutually exclusive.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. When all items are increased in price by a fixed amount (in this case, $0.50), it affects both the mean and each individual value equally. The range is determined by the difference between the highest and lowest prices; since they both increase by 50 cents, the range remains unchanged. Therefore, only the mean price will increase by 50 cents.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If all prices increase by the same amount, the mean price will also increase by that amount, and the range will remain unchanged. The standard deviation measures how spread out the values are from the mean; since each value is increased by a constant (50 cents), it does not affect the relative distances between them or their dispersion around the new mean.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In this method, each employee within their respective plant has an equal chance of being chosen (1 in 200), but different groups of 6 from one plant cannot be combined with other plants to form a group of 30 employees. This means that not every possible combination of 30 employees has the same probability of being selected, which is required for simple random sampling.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since each plant contributes the same number of employees to the sample, it ensures that every employee has an equal chance of being selected, making it a simple random sample. The method described is indeed stratified sampling where strata (plants) are used to ensure representation from all groups.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. T-distributions do indeed vary with different degrees of freedom (df), they are bell-shaped and symmetric, and they tend to be more spread out compared to a standard normal distribution. However, t-distributions have mean 0 but their standard deviation is not always 1; it depends on the df value.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Just like the standard normal distribution, all t-distributions have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, regardless of the degrees of freedom.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Following up with non-respondents (A), asking questions neutrally (B), and using stratified random sampling (C) are all methods that help reduce bias in a survey. However, selecting samples randomly (D) is already part of the process to ensure unbiased representation; it doesn't further reduce bias compared to other options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Randomly selecting samples, regardless of the specific method used, is the most crucial step in reducing bias and ensuring a representative sample. Following up with non-respondents can help reduce nonresponse bias. Asking questions neutrally helps avoid introducing response bias.

C,"Let's reason step by step. To calculate the minimum sample size for a given margin of error (E) and confidence level, we can use the formula n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (approximately 1.96 for 95%), p is the estimated proportion of successes (0.5 when unknown), and E is the margin of error expressed as a decimal (0.025). Plugging in these values, we get n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.025^2, which results in approximately 1537.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the formula for sample size with a 95% confidence level and 2.5% margin of error, we get a minimum sample size of approximately 40 voters. This is because when using the standard normal distribution (Z-score) value for a 95% confidence interval (1.96), the formula n = (Z^2 * p(1-p)) / E^2 simplifies to around 40, where 'E' represents the margin of error and 'p' is the estimated proportion.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The data collected in this scenario is based on voluntary responses, which introduces the possibility of bias as those with strong opinions are more likely to respond. This makes it difficult to generalize the results to a larger population or draw meaningful conclusions about the overall opinion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While the sample size is large, the survey suffers from voluntary response bias. Selecting a random sample from the respondents would address this issue and provide a more representative view.

The 25th percentile is one standard deviation below the mean. So, subtracting the standard deviation of 4 g from the mean of 45 g gives us 42.2 g as the egg mass at the 25th percentile. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The researcher plans to obtain a random sample of principals from each district rather than sampling all lists together. This approach divides the population into homogeneous groups (districts) and then takes a simple random sample within those groups, which is characteristic of stratified sampling.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since a random sample of principals is obtained from each district, it essentially forms a simple random sample of the entire population, just achieved in a more manageable way.

When combining independent variables, we subtract their means and standard deviations.

C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the 10th percentile of a normal distribution, we need to determine the z-score corresponding to that percentile and then use it with the mean and standard deviation. The z-score for the 10th percentile is approximately -1.28 (from z-tables). Using the formula X = μ + Zσ, where X is the value we're looking for, μ is the mean, Z is the z-score, and σ is the standard deviation: X = 6 + (-1.28)(1.6) = 4.912 inches.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a hypothesis test is the probability that it correctly rejects H0 when Ha is true. A higher significance level (\u03b1) and larger sample size (n) both contribute to greater power. In this case, since \u03bc = 65, which is less than 70, we want a test with high power. Comparing the options, choice D has both a relatively higher significance level (\u03b1 = 0.01) and larger sample size (n = 30), resulting in greater power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A lower significance level (α) reduces the chance of a Type I error, which is more important for ensuring the accuracy of the test, leading to greater power even with a smaller sample size. However, increasing the sample size (n) also increases the power of the test because it provides more information about the population and makes it easier to detect an effect if one exists. In this case, option D (\u03b1 = 0.01, n = 30) combines a low significance level with a larger sample size, resulting in the greatest power for the test when \u03bc = 65.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of a set of values from their mean. A lower standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, suggesting more homogeneity in performance among students.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the sum of two random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expected values, so E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y). For variance, if X and Y are independent, var(X + Y) = var(X) + var(Y), since covariance term would be zero. Here, we have E(X) = 37, E(Y) = 62, so E(X + Y) = 99.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified sampling involves dividing a population into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to ensure representation of all groups in the sample.

Both methods aim to reduce variability and improve accuracy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies involve actively introducing a treatment to a group and observing the effects, while still examining a pre-existing condition. In an experiment, researchers assign treatments but do not allow subjects to self-select into groups; randomization is key. While both observational studies and controlled experiments can provide valuable insights, only well-designed controlled experiments with proper controls and randomization can establish cause and effect relationships reliably. Stratifying in sampling involves dividing a population into subgroups before sampling, while blocking for experiments refers to grouping subjects based on certain characteristics to reduce variability within treatment groups.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. To gather a representative sample considering geographical variation in musical tastes, it is important to include participants from all regions proportionally.

Option D classifies customers by state and selects 3% from each state, which accounts for proportionality based on customer distribution.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since musical tastes vary by region, we need equal representation from each state. Choosing 10 customers from each state ensures we capture the diversity of preferences across different geographical locations.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A t-test assumes that the samples come from populations with normal distributions, especially when sample sizes are small (less than 30). In this case, since we have a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location, it is crucial to assume that the population of sales records at each location follows a normal distribution for the t-test results to be valid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The t-test requires knowledge of the population standard deviations to accurately estimate the standard error and calculate the test statistic. However, in practice, we often use sample data instead of actual population parameters. When comparing two independent samples with a t-test, it is assumed that both populations have equal variances (homogeneity of variance). This assumption allows for an accurate comparison between the means.",A

Instead, she implemented an intervention (weekly practice quizzes) and observed its effects on her class without comparing them to a control group that did not receive the intervention.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy in percentages can be attributed to differences in the samples used for the poll and the vote, as not all eligible voters participated in the actual vote. This difference is due to variations between two different samples rather than a bias or nonrandom selection issue.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the poll and the vote suggests a selection bias, where the individuals who responded to the survey were not representative of the entire population of voters.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size (I) generally increases the power of a hypothesis test because it reduces variability and makes it easier to detect an effect if one exists. Increasing the significance level (II) also increases the power, as it raises the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.

By looking at the standard normal distribution table, we find that Z_70% is approximately 0.524 and Z_80% is about 0.842.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. In this case, every student studied for exactly 10 hours on the second exam, meaning there is no variation in study time for that exam.

C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.

The experiment uses randomization to assign students to different reading groups, which allows for a cause-and-effect conclusion about the impact of reading time on GPA. Blinding is not necessary in this context as it involves educational interventions rather than medical treatments where placebo effects are more common.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders out of 150,000 total riders. This means we need to find the middle 2/3 (approximately) of the distribution since 100,000 is about two-thirds of 150,000. Using the empirical rule for normal distributions, approximately 68% of data falls within one standard deviation from the mean, and around 95% falls within two standard deviations.

We know that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In a binomial distribution, as the number of trials increases, the standard deviation decreases relative to the mean, making outcomes more predictable. For the first game (45%-55% heads), flipping 300 times provides a higher chance of achieving this range due to reduced variability. In contrast, for the second game (more than 80% heads), having fewer trials (30) increases the chances because it's harder to achieve such an extreme result with more flips.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A larger sample size always provides a more accurate estimate of the true proportion of heads, increasing the chances of winning in both games. Therefore, flipping the coin 300 times is preferable for both scenarios. The correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, while the slope of the regression line represents how much one variable changes on average when another variable increases by 1 unit. The correlation coefficient (r) is equal to the slope of the regression line only when both variables are standardized into z-scores. Therefore, option D correctly states that r equals the slope of the regression line when plotting z-scores for y against x.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the correlation is 0, it means there's no linear relationship between the variables, resulting in a vertical regression line with an undefined slope. Switching which variable is called x and y does not change the sign of the correlation because correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship regardless of the labeling of variables.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of rolling a 6 on one die is 1/6, so the probability of rolling two sixes simultaneously is (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36. Since there are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, this means that winning $20 happens with a probability of 1/36. The expected gain from winning is then ($20 * 1/36). However, it costs $2 to play the game each time, so we subtract this cost: (($20 * 1/36) - $2). Calculating this gives us an expected loss of about $1.44 per game.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of rolling two sixes is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36. So, the expected gain is (1/36 * $20) - $2 = $0.55 per game. Therefore, on average, a player will lose about $1.45 ($2 - $0.55).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error in a poll represents the range within which the true value lies with a certain level of confidence, typically around 95%. In this case, a margin of error of 3% means that if we were to conduct the same survey multiple times, the percentage of households using grocery coupons would likely fall between 79% and 85%, considering the initial result was 82%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A margin of error of 3% means that 3% of the surveyed population chose not to participate in the poll, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. This is because a margin of error represents the range within which the true value lies with a certain level of confidence.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The researcher used a simple random sample, which is good for reducing bias and ensuring that each individual has an equal chance of being selected. However, the sampling location (a Wall Street office building) may introduce selection bias as it does not represent the entire adult population in terms of economic confidence. Additionally, obtaining responses only from those willing to participate could lead to voluntary response bias.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The high response rate suggests that most individuals approached were willing to participate, indicating a representative sample and a well-designed survey. However, the sampling method may introduce selection bias since it only includes adults leaving a Wall Street office building on a weekday afternoon, which might not represent the entire U.S. adult population's confidence in the economy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of not committing a Type I error in one test is 1 - \u03b1 = 0.95. Since the tests are independent, the probability of not making any Type I errors across all 10 tests is (0.95)^10. Therefore, the probability of making at least one Type I error is 1 - (0.95)^10.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of committing a Type I error in a single test is 0.05. Therefore, the probability of making at least one Type I error in 10 tests is also 0.05. To find this, we can calculate the complementary probability (not making any errors) and subtract it from 1: P(at least one error) = 1 - P(no errors). The probability of not committing a Type I error in all 10 tests is (1 - 0.05)^10, which equals approximately 0.60. Therefore, the probability of making at least one Type I error across the 10 tests is 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The significant difference in percentages between the two questionnaire results suggests that the way the questions were phrased influenced respondents' answers, leading to a biased outcome. This phenomenon is known as response bias.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy in results is likely due to a placebo effect, where the wording of the questions influenced participants' responses, creating a perceived benefit from the proposed budget increase. This psychological phenomenon can lead to significant differences in survey outcomes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 observations generally leads to a more precise estimate of the population mean, as it reduces the standard error and narrows the confidence interval. Even though the means and standard deviations are approximately the same for both samples, using 35 observations provides greater precision in estimating the true population parameter.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 introduces more variability and potential for error, making the results less reliable. However, a larger sample size generally leads to a narrower confidence interval due to reduced standard error. But in this case, since the mean and standard deviation are approximately the same for both samples, there is no advantage gained from increasing the sample size.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In the first study, subjects were simply observed based on their self-reported eating habits without any intervention from researchers. This makes it an observational study. On the other hand, in the second study, participants were actively assigned to either a meat or vegetarian diet for 6 months by the researchers, which is characteristic of a controlled experiment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the first study, the researchers controlled the subjects' diets by assigning them to either a meat-eating or vegetarian group, making it a controlled experiment. The second study also involved controlling the participants' diets for 6 months and comparing their weights afterward, which is another example of a controlled experiment.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean of a binomial distribution can be calculated using the formula: mean = n * p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. In this case, mean = 150 * 0.76 = 114. To find the standard deviation, we use the formula: sqrt(n * p * (1 - p)). So, standard deviation = sqrt(150 * 0.76 * (1 - 0.76)) = sqrt(150 * 0.76 * 0.24) = sqrt(27.36) ≈ 5.23.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is np = 150 * 0.76 = 114. The standard deviation is np(1-p) = 150 * 0.76 * 0.24 = 27.35. Therefore, the correct answer includes both values.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In this experiment, each engine type is tested twice: once with the additive and once without it. This creates pairs of observations for each engine type. Since we are comparing two related measurements (the lifespan of an engine with and without the additive), a matched pairs comparison would be appropriate. The data being compared are continuous (lifespans), so we should use means rather than proportions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the study compares the proportion of engines with extended lifespans when using the additive versus not using it, a matched pairs comparison of population proportions is most appropriate. This design accounts for variability between different engine types and allows for direct comparison within each pair.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sample proportion (p-hat) is 8% or 0.08, and the standard error for a proportion can be calculated as sqrt((p-hat * (1 - p-hat)) / n), where n is the sample size. For this problem, SE = sqrt((0.08 * 0.92) / 500). The z-score for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 1.96. The margin of error (ME) can be calculated as z * SE. Finally, the midpoint of the confidence interval is p-hat = 0.08.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the midpoint of the interval is 0.08 + 0.025 = 0.105. However, none of the given options match this value.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Discrete random variables have numerical outcomes that are mutually exclusive, and their expected value is calculated as described in option C. However, statement D refers to a property of continuous distributions (approximately 95% within two standard deviations), not discrete ones.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since discrete random variables follow a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the outcomes will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. This is not true for all discrete random variables as they may have different distributions.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The goal is to obtain a representative sample for analysis, which requires maximizing response rate and minimizing bias. Using only returned surveys (A) could introduce non-response bias if the non-respondents differ significantly from respondents. Increasing the sample size without addressing non-responses (B) doesn't solve this issue. Selecting additional class members (C) may not correct for potential differences between original and new participants. Following up with non-responders (D) is the best option to increase response rate, reduce bias, and maintain the integrity of the initial sample.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since 27 surveys were not returned, the sample size should be adjusted to 48 for analysis to maintain accuracy. However, it is essential to minimize non-response bias and ensure a representative sample of the population. Following up with those who did not return the survey (option D) would help achieve this goal by potentially increasing the response rate.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In this sampling method, known as systematic sampling, students are chosen at regular intervals (every 25th student). This does not guarantee that every possible sample of the intended size has an equal chance of being selected because it depends on the order in which students enter the school.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As long as there is a single entrance to the school, selecting every 25th student ensures that each student has an equal chance of being selected, resulting in a simple random sample. The key factor here is not whether students have different chances based on their entry order but rather if they all have an opportunity to be chosen.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. When you triple the sample size, the square root of that value will increase by a factor of about 1.732 (the square root of 3). Therefore, tripling the sample size results in dividing the original confidence interval size by approximately 1.732.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tripling the sample size reduces the standard error by a factor of square root of 3, which is approximately 1.732. Therefore, the confidence interval size is multiplied by 1.732. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that it multiples the interval size by 1.732.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the total combined weight is 992 pounds for four players, which means each player has an average weight of 992/4 = 248 pounds (given). Since standard deviation measures dispersion and doesn't change with averaging, we can use the formula for combining variances: sqrt(n) * sigma, where n is the number of players. So, the standard deviation for four players would be sqrt(4) * 47 = 2 * 47 = 94 pounds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. So, the standard deviation of W is sqrt(4 * 47^2) = 94 pounds. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a normal distribution, percentiles correspond to standard deviations from the mean. The z-score for the 40th percentile is approximately -0.25 (negative because it's below the mean). To find the difference in weight, multiply this z-score by the standard deviation: -0.25 * 0.28 = -0.07. This means that a bag at the 40th percentile weighs approximately 0.07 ounce less than the mean.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.25. Therefore, the weight of a bag at the 40th percentile is 0.25 * 0.28 = 0.07 ounces above the mean. So, the correct answer is that it's 0.07 ounce above the mean.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval (18, 41) indicates that Lipitor outperforms niacin in lowering cholesterol levels by an average difference between 18 and 41 points. This means the correct conclusion is that there is a 95% probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin by at least 23 points (the midpoint of the interval) on average, not for any given individual.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies a 95% probability that any individual's cholesterol reduction with Lipitor will fall within the given range compared to niacin. The difference in mean cholesterol level lowering is estimated between 18 and 41 points, meaning Lipitor outperforms niacin by at least 23 points (41 - 18).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A z-score of -2.46 indicates that the sample mean (9350 pounds) is significantly lower than the population mean (9500 pounds). The P-value of 0.0069 suggests a low probability of observing such a difference if there were no actual change in the production process. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that the new process has resulted in engines with reduced thrust.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.0069 means there's a 0.69% chance that an engine produced with the new process will have a thrust greater than the original mean of 9500 pounds. This low probability suggests that the change in production has indeed affected the engines, causing them to produce less thrust on average.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Standardized scores, or z-scores, are unitless measures of how many standard deviations a value is from the mean. Changing units (from seconds to minutes) does not affect the relative position of data points in relation to each other and their spread around the mean. Therefore, the student's standardized score will remain unchanged.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting seconds to minutes involves dividing by 60, so the z-score should also be divided by 60, resulting in a new z-score of 0.04. Therefore, the student's standardized score will remain unchanged.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to systematic errors in data collection or analysis that lead to incorrect conclusions about the population being studied. It often results from non-random sampling methods, which can cause a sample not to accurately represent the entire population. Therefore, both options B and D describe aspects of bias, but option B is more comprehensive as it directly states that bias describes a process resulting in an unrepresentative sample.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to a sampling process that systematically excludes or overrepresents certain segments of the population, leading to a sample that doesn't reflect the population's characteristics. While all options touch on aspects related to bias, option B most accurately defines it as a process resulting in a non-representative sample.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The purpose of a control group is to provide a baseline for comparison against the experimental groups, which in this case are exposed to different types of music. A third group that experiences no music would serve as an effective control because it allows us to observe piecework output without any musical influence and compare it with the outputs from the classical and light rock music groups.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A good control group should experience elements of both treatments to isolate the effects of each music genre, so a group randomly exposed to classical or rock music would be ideal. This allows for comparison between specific genres and no music at all.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling is designed to reduce bias and variability compared to simple random sampling by ensuring representation from all subgroups (strata) in the population. However, it doesn't necessarily provide information about each stratum as well as an estimate for the whole population; that would be a feature of cluster sampling or multi-stage sampling rather than stratified random sampling.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling ensures representation from all strata, providing information about each subgroup and the overall population, which simple random sampling doesn't necessarily achieve. However, stratification can increase variability within samples due to differences between strata. Therefore, option B is not an advantage of stratified over simple random sampling.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The primary difference between an experiment and an observational study lies in the manipulation of variables. In experiments, researchers actively manipulate one or more independent variables to observe their effect on a dependent variable. On the other hand, observational studies involve observing subjects without intervention from the researcher.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The main difference lies in the use of control and treatment groups; while both methods utilize these groups, experiments require randomization to ensure unbiased results, whereas observational studies don't. However, this is not the primary distinction between them. Experiments involve manipulation of variables to observe effects on response variables, which is their defining characteristic. Observational studies simply record observations without intervention.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A confidence interval provides a range within which we can be confident that the true population parameter (in this case, mean weight) lies based on sample data. The statement 'In repeated samplings of the same size, 95 percent of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety' correctly describes what a 95% confidence interval means.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of oranges from this variety will fall within the weight range of 7.58 to 8.72 ounces. This is because a confidence interval provides an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, in this case, the mean weight of all oranges of this variety.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value represents the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as those observed during the study, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. It does not directly relate to Type I or Type II errors but rather informs us about how unusual our data are under the assumption of the null hypothesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value represents the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false, indicating the likelihood of a Type II error. However, more accurately, it measures the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the observed data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. This means if we get a very low P-value (typically less than 0.05), there's strong evidence against the null hypothesis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Option I guarantees a return of $25,000. For Option II, the expected value is (0.5 * $50,000) + (0.5 * $10,000) = $30,000. For Option III, the expected value is (0.05 * $100,000) + (0.95 * $0) = $5,000. Therefore, if the company wants to maximize its expected return, it should choose Option II.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize expected return, the company should choose Option II, as it has the highest average potential return of $30,000 compared to the other options. If the company needs at least $20,000 for an overdue loan, Option I guarantees this amount and is therefore a safe choice. However, Option III would not be suitable if they need at least $80,000 as it has only a 5% chance of returning that much.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The increase in production output with each change in music suggests that the employees were influenced not just by the actual sound but also by their belief or expectation of a positive effect, which is characteristic of the placebo effect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Each change in music genre acts as a separate treatment unit, and the observed increase in production is a direct result of the specific music played each day.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To construct a 94% confidence interval, we need to find the z-value that leaves 3% in each tail of the standard normal distribution (since it is two-tailed). Looking up this value in a standard normal table or using statistical software gives us an upper critical value of approximately 1.88.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a 94% confidence interval, we need to find the z-score that leaves 3% in each tail, which corresponds to a critical value of 1.555.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Using the Z-score formula and given percentages, we can find two equations: Z_1 (for 60%) and Z_2 (for 70%). Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the mean (\u03bc) and standard deviation (\u03c3). The correct answer is \u03bc = 4.377, \u03c3 = 3.261.",D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Since 70% of parts last less than 6 years, the standard deviation should be around (6-3)/3 = 1 year. Now, we know that 40% of parts do not last over 3 years, which means they fall below one standard deviation from the mean in a normal distribution. Therefore, the mean (\u03bc) is approximately 3 + 1 = 4 years and the standard deviation (\u03c3) is around 1 year.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis (H0) should represent the status quo or a statement of no effect, while the alternative hypothesis (Ha) represents what we want to prove.

To support the claim that over 60% of visitors shop at the store, the null hypothesis should state that the proportion is less than or equal to 60%, while the alternative hypothesis claims it's greater than 60%.

This setup ensures that any differences observed between the two groups can be attributed to the treatments themselves rather than other factors. Therefore, this design fits the description of a completely randomized design with two different treatments.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A higher confidence level means that we want to be more certain about our estimate, which requires a wider interval to capture the true population proportion with greater assurance. Therefore, increasing from a 90% to a 99% confidence interval will increase the size of the interval.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% requires a wider interval to capture a larger range of possible values, resulting in a 9% increase in interval size.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The Central Limit Theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution (x-bar) is equal to the population mean, which corresponds to statement I.

Using a standard normal distribution table, we find that the probability of a fuse lasting at least 1 hour is approximately 0.841 for both companies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The range being 50 means that the difference between the largest and smallest number is 50, so the smallest number must be 150 (200 - 50). Since there are four numbers in total, for the median to be less than 195, at least two of the numbers would have to be below 195. However, we know that one number is 200 and another must be 150 (the smallest), so it's not possible for both remaining numbers to be above 195 without exceeding the largest value of 200. Therefore, statement C cannot be true. Statement D is always true for any set of four numbers arranged in ascending order because the median will indeed be the mean (average) of the second and third numbers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the range is 50 and the largest value is 200, the smallest value must be 150. This suggests that the mean is likely greater than 165, considering the values are spread out.
