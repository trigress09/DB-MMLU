From the first two simplified propositions, we can deduce that U must be true for both T and W to be false. The third proposition requires either ~U or ~X when T is false.

For an argument to be valid, whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if both premises are true, it does not necessarily mean that E is true when F is false. A counterexample would be when E is false and F is true; then ~E \u2228 F is true but E (the conclusion) is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (E) must be true. Since the second premise (~F) is also true, the first premise (~E ∨ F) must be false. This happens when E is true and F is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid with this counterexample.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument presents a chain of consequences that starts with not abolishing capital punishment and ends with the undesirable outcome of having to build more prisons. Each statement is presented as a consequence of the previous one, leading up to the initial claim which is the conclusion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts by stating that if we abolish capital punishment, prisons will become more crowded. This sets the stage for the consequences of such an action. It then follows with a conditional statement: If prisons become more crowded, then new ones must be built. Finally, it concludes with a negative preference against building more prisons. The conclusion is that we shouldn't abolish capital punishment to avoid these outcomes.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'Not all lobsters are red' means that there exists at least one lobster which is not red. This can be translated into predicate logic as: There exists an x such that x is a lobster and it is not the case that x is red, or ~(\u2203x)(Lx \u2227 Rx).",C,"Let's reason step by step. 'Not all' implies negating the statement 'all lobsters are red'. This translates to negating the universal quantifier and the conjunction, resulting in ~(∀x)(Lx • Rx).",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a translation that says there exists some kind person and there exists some endangered species such that the kind person helps the endangered species. Option A correctly states this: 'There exists an x, where x is both kind and a person, and there exists a y, where y is both endangered and a species, and x helps y.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a connection between kind people helping endangered species. This suggests an implication, where the existence of kind people and endangered species leads to the act of helping. Option D correctly represents this relationship with two existential quantifiers for both kinds of entities (kind people and endangered species) and an implication symbol (\u2283), indicating that if such individuals and species exist, then there is a helping action between them.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to express that there exists a robber who steals money from some bank. Option D correctly represents this statement: 'There exists an x such that x is a robber, and for some y (which is money), there exists a z (a bank) where the robber steals the money from the bank.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. 'Some robbers' suggests an existential quantifier for robbers, so we start with (∃x). Then, 'steal money from a bank' implies existential quantifiers for both money and bank, so we add (∃y)(∃z). The predicate Sxyz represents the action of stealing y from z by x. Therefore, the correct translation is: some robber(Rx) exists who steals money(My) from a bank(Bz), which corresponds to option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Construct the truth table for (M \u2228 N), (\u00acM \u00b7 O), and (N). If there is a row where both premises are true but the conclusion is false, then it presents a counterexample to validity. Upon constructing the truth table, we find that when M is true, O is true, and N is false, both premises (\u00acM \u00b7 O) and (M \u2228 N) are true but the conclusion (N) is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (N) must be false. Since the second premise includes '~M', let's make M true. This would make the first premise true regardless of the value of N. Now for O to not affect the truth of the argument, it should also be true. So we have a counterexample when M and O are true but N is false.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Firstly, we construct the truth tables for both propositions: ~[(G \u2192 H) \u2228 ~H] and ~G \u2192 G. After evaluating all possible combinations of truth values for G and H, it is clear that there are no instances where one proposition is true while the other is false; however, they also do not have identical truth values in every case. Therefore, they are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory. Since there exists at least one scenario (when both G and H are false) where both propositions are true, they are consistent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Applying De Morgan's Law to the first proposition, we get ~(G ⊃ H) • ~~H, which simplifies to (~G • ~H) • H. This looks similar to the second proposition (~G ⊃ G), suggesting they might be contradictory. However, upon constructing a truth table and comparing both propositions' truth values for all possible combinations of G and H, we find that there are cases where both statements can be true simultaneously, indicating they are not contradictory but consistent.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'if and only if' indicates a biconditional relationship, which is represented in predicate logic as '\u2261'. Cecilia breaking my heart (Bc) happens when Maria is either a problem (Pm) or a girl (Gm), not both conditions at the same time. Therefore, we use the logical OR operator (\u2228).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Cecilia breaking my heart and Maria being a problem and a girl. This translates to an 'if-then' statement with a conjunction. However, the phrase 'if and only if' indicates that both conditions must be true simultaneously for Cecilia to break my heart.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given formula (~B \u2022 E) \u2283 D translates to 'If it is not the case that Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by, then Russell makes dinner.' This means if both conditions are false (Izzy doesn't play Minecraft and Ashleigh doesn't stop by), then Russell will make dinner. The correct answer matches this explanation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The formula suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by, leading to Russell making dinner. However, the negation (~B) indicates that if it is not true that both B and E occur together, then D must happen. Therefore, the correct translation should reflect this conditional relationship.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In a conditional proposition, the antecedent is the 'if' part that comes before the 'then'. The statement says 'only if both...', which means raising tuition depends on two conditions being met: governor approval and board recommendation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence mentions the governor approving of the tuition raise as a condition, suggesting this is the antecedent of the conditional proposition. However, another condition also needs to be met: the board of trustees recommending it. Therefore, both conditions together form the complete antecedent.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name.' can be translated into predicate logic as: If Leroy is bad (B), then DJ Khaled shouts his name (S). This corresponds to the logical implication B \u2192 S, which in options given is represented by 'D': Bl \u2283 Sk.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that DJ Khaled shouting Leroy's name is a sufficient condition for Leroy being bad. This translates to (Sk ≡ Bl). However, the options provided do not include this exact equivalence.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument consists of two premises: 'E \u2192 F' (If E then F) and 'G \u2192 ~F' (If G then not F). From these, we want to deduce '~G \u2228 ~E' (Not G or Not E). If both premises are true, it means that if E is true, F must be true; and if G is true, F must be false. This implies that E and G cannot both be true because they would lead to a contradiction where F has to be both true and not true at the same time. Therefore, either ~G or ~E (or both) must be true for the argument to hold without contradiction. The argument is valid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion must be false. Since the conclusion includes negations, let's make both ~G and ~E false, meaning G and E are true. For the premises to hold with these values: If E is true, then F must also be true (from E \u2192 F). However, if G is true, then F cannot be true (since G \u2192 ~F), which creates a contradiction. Therefore, this argument is invalid.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument consists of two premises: (A \u2228 B) \u2283 C and C \u2283 ~D, leading to the conclusion D \u2283 A. To test validity using an indirect truth table, we assume that all premises are true and the conclusion is false. If this leads to a contradiction, the argument is valid; otherwise, it's invalid. Assuming C is true (from the first premise), ~D must also be true (second premise). However, if D is false, A cannot lead to D being false as stated in the conclusion, which contradicts our assumption that the conclusion is false when all premises are true. Therefore, a counterexample exists where B and C are true while A and D are false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (D ⊃ A) must be false. This means D must be true and A must be false. Since the second premise involves ~D, let's make C false as well. Now we have B = True to satisfy the first premise ((A \u2228 B) \u2283 C). So, a counterexample is when D and B are true while A and C are false.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument consists of two premises: ~C \u2192 D (if not C, then D) and D \u2192 C (if D, then C).

Constructing a truth table for all possible values of C and D shows that there is no row where both premises are true and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is valid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (C) must be false. Since the second premise (D ⊃ C) has C as the consequent, let's make D true to potentially make the second premise true. Now we need ~C to be true for the first premise (~C ⊃ D). This makes both premises true and the conclusion false, which is a counterexample.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a translation that says 'there exists an animal and there exists a person such that the person is cruel and neglects the animal'. Option A incorrectly states that some animals are also cruel, which doesn't match our original statement. Option B suggests that all cruel people are animals, which isn't what we want to say either. Option C implies that every animal is a person, which is incorrect. The correct answer should express 'some animals and some cruel people exist such that the cruel person neglects the animal'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a relationship between animals and cruel people. This suggests an existential quantifier for both, so we start with (∃x)(∃y). 'Some animals are neglected by cruel people' means there exists at least one animal that is being neglected by someone who is cruel. So the predicate logic should express: There exists an x such that x is an animal and there exists a y such that y is a person, y is cruel, and y neglects x. This corresponds to option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence states that if either Harry enrolls (H) or George does not enroll (~G), then Jim enrolls (J).

The sentence implies that either Harry enrolls or George doesn't enroll, but not both, so we use the exclusive disjunction symbol. Then it states that if this condition is true, Jim enrolls.

A,"Let's reason step by step. From the premises N \u2192 (N \u2192 ~O) and N \u2192 P, we can use modus ponens to infer that if N is true, then both (N \u2192 ~O) and P are also true. Since the first premise states that (N \u2192 ~O) implies (O \u2228 Q), and we have established that N leads to (N \u2192 ~O), it follows as an immediate consequence that N must lead to (O \u2228 Q).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The second premise states that P implies (N ⊃ ~O), and since the third premise affirms N ⊃ P, we can directly infer (N ⊃ ~O).",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first proposition, ~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P), is equivalent to (~N \u2228 (O \u00b7 P)). For the second proposition, ~O \u2283 Q is equivalent to (O \u2228 Q). The third proposition N \u00b7 ~Q remains as it is. To find a consistent valuation, we need values for N, O, P, and Q that make all three propositions true simultaneously. If we choose N = True, O = False, P = False, and Q = False, the first proposition becomes (False \u2228 (False \u00b7 False)) which is True; the second proposition becomes (True \u2228 False) which is also True; and the third proposition remains as it is with N = True and ~Q = True. Therefore, all three propositions are consistent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If N, O, and P are true, then ~N is false, (O · P) is true, and ~O is false, making the first two premises true.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'No artifacts are people' can be translated into predicate logic as: For all x, if x is an artifact then x is not a person. This corresponds to the universal quantifier (\u2200x) and implication (Ax \u2192 ~Px).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for every x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person, so we use the universal quantifier and the conjunction symbol.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement is a conditional, so we need to use the implication symbol (\u2192).
