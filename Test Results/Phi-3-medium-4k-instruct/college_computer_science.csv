A,"Let's reason step by step. I. M-7 has a shorter clock cycle (7.5 ns) than M-5 (10 ns), which means it can potentially complete more instructions per second, indicating better maximum throughput. II. The latency of a single instruction is determined by the number of pipeline stages and the clock cycle time; since M-7 has fewer stages but a shorter clock cycle, its latency could be lower or higher depending on how these factors balance out. III. Programs executing on M-7 will not always run faster than those on M-5 due to potential issues like pipeline stalls, branch mispredictions, and other overheads that can affect performance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since M-7 has more pipeline stages, it takes less time for each individual instruction to complete, resulting in shorter latency.

With linear resolution, the collisions are resolved by placing elements in subsequent buckets. For key 8, since bucket 3 is occupied, it goes to bucket 4. Key 10 then moves from bucket 0 to bucket 1 due to collision with an imaginary element at index 0 (since there's no previous bucket). Finally, for key 3, which also maps to bucket 3 and finds it occupied by keys 8 and 13, it goes to the next available bucket, which is bucket 2.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The key 10 has a hash value of 2 (10 mod 5 = 2), so it will be placed in bucket 2 after 13 and 8 occupy buckets 3 and 3 respectively.

By testing powers of 3, we find that 3^4 = 81 is too small, but 3^5 = 243 is also insufficient. However, 3^6 = 729 meets the requirement.

Macros and recursion are not directly related to this requirement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Recursive programs can be called multiple times with different instances, allowing them to be shared among several users without conflicts.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Write-allocation ensures that cache lines are allocated and loaded on a write miss, which means both policies (write-through and write-back) will have the same number of writes to main memory for each write operation since every write affects main memory in write-through and is delayed until eviction in write-back. Therefore, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will be the same for both policies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In write-back, every write operation immediately updates main memory, leading to a higher percentage of memory operations compared to write-through. Write-allocation ensures that cache lines are allocated and loaded on a write-miss, which can increase the hit ratio for writes in both policies.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Option A suggests that pushing an element onto an empty stack makes it still empty, which contradicts the definition of push operation.

Option D also aligns with the LIFO principle as pushing two elements onto an initially empty stack should not make it empty.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The IsEmpty operation should return true if the stack will be empty after pushing an element, as it indicates that the element is the only one on the stack. Pop removes the topmost element from a non-empty stack and returns the modified stack without that element. Top retrieves the topmost element of the stack without modifying it. The equation 'IsEmpty(Push(Stack,Elem)) = true' does not represent conventional semantics because after pushing an element onto a stack, it should never be empty.",A

Since the mean time between failures is 10,000 hours, the software is available 10,000 out of 10,000 hours, resulting in 100% availability. However, when considering the mean time to repair (20 hours), we need to account for downtime during repairs. The total cycle time would be 10,000 + 20 = 10,020 hours.

Option A (prioritizing queues) can still lead to deadlock if high-priority processes hold resources needed by lower priority ones indefinitely. Option B (requesting all resources upfront) prevents deadlocks as it avoids partial allocation of resources that could cause circular wait conditions. Option C (numbering and ordering requests) also helps prevent deadlocks by enforcing a strict order for resource acquisition, eliminating the possibility of circular waits. However, option D (random timeouts and restarts) does not effectively deal with deadlock as it may lead to repeated attempts without resolving the underlying issue.",D,"Let's reason step by step. By assigning priorities, higher-priority processes can acquire resources first, preventing lower-priority processes from holding resources needed by others and causing deadlock.

In this case, S=0.4 and N=100 seconds. For 2 processors: T = 0.4*100 + (1 - 0.4)/2 * 100 = 70 seconds. For 4 processors: T = 0.4*100 + (1 - 0.4)/4 * 100 = 55 seconds.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Each instruction takes 500 ns and requires 2 memory references, so the total time for instructions is 1000 ns. Cache misses occur on 1% of references, resulting in an additional delay of 2000 ns * 0.01 = 20 ns per reference or 40 ns per instruction (since there are two references). During half of this time (20 ns), the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss.

The total time for executing an instruction is 500 + (20/2) = 510 nanoseconds since half of the delay does not use the bus.

Option C, '11111111' represents -1 in two's complement (since the most significant bit is 1) and when added to '10000001', which represents -125, results in a sum of '-256'.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), there are no cycles, meaning you cannot start at one vertex and follow a sequence of edges to return to the starting vertex. This implies that every edge must lead from a lower-numbered vertex to a higher-numbered vertex in some topological ordering. Therefore, there must be at least one vertex with no incoming edges (a source), making statement I true. However, not all vertices need to have outgoing edges; it's possible for the graph to end with sink nodes that have no outgoing edges, so II is not necessarily true.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In a strictly binary tree, each non-leaf node has exactly two children, resulting in the maximum number of nodes at any level being 2^level. Given that the ratio of lengths of root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by c, this implies that all leaf nodes are within a constant factor of distance from the root. The height h of such a tree would be log2(N) in an ideal scenario where each node has exactly two children at every level (a perfect binary tree).

The ratio of path lengths is bounded by c, so the height of the tree should be proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes, with c as the proportionality constant. This means that h = k * log2(N) for some constant k. Since we know that every non-leaf node has two children and the ratio is bounded by c, it implies that the height cannot exceed this bound significantly. Therefore, the best characterization of the tree's height would be a lower or equal limit to the logarithmic function multiplied by c.",A

Additionally, averaging requires ten CPU instructions per set of four samples, which adds another 10 microseconds. Therefore, the maximum average instruction execution time to keep up with data rates is calculated by dividing the total processing time (250 microseconds) by the number of instructions executed during this period (4 signals * 5 instructions + 10 for averaging = 20 + 10 = 30). So, 250 / 30 = approximately 8.33 microseconds per instruction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. For four signals, it would take (4 * 12) = 48 microseconds for all samples plus (5 instructions/sample * 4 samples) = 20 additional CPU cycles. To find the average instruction execution time, we divide the total available time by the number of instructions: 48 / (20 + 10) = 48 / 30 = 1.6 microseconds.",C
