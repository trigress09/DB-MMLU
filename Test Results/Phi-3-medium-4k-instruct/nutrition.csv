C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the process where the body adjusts its energy expenditure, particularly basal metabolic rate (BMR), in response to changes in environmental conditions or dietary intake. It does not directly relate to heat loss, non-shivering thermogenesis, or physical activity levels. The most accurate description is an increase in BMR that cannot be fully explained by body composition changes during chronic overfeeding.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's way of adjusting to cold temperatures, and one way it does this is by decreasing non-essential heat production like non-shivering thermogenesis. This helps conserve energy when exposed to cold.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy and in early childhood have been shown to improve child development outcomes, including cognitive function and growth. Therefore, both interventions are beneficial.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that interventions during pregnancy, like protein-energy supplementation, have a significant impact on child development by providing essential nutrients during critical growth stages. Additionally, the first two years of life are crucial for brain development and overall health, making proper nutrition vital during this period as well. Therefore, both interventions would contribute positively to child development.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A diet for weight maintenance should include foods that help control blood sugar levels, provide satiety, and support muscle mass. High-protein diets are known to increase feelings of fullness and preserve lean body mass during weight loss or maintenance. Low glycemic index (GI) foods cause a slower rise in blood glucose levels, which can help control appetite and prevent overeating. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is high protein and low GI.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To maintain weight, we need to avoid foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, so a low-protein, high-GI diet would be appropriate as it promotes slower digestion and prevents excessive insulin release. Additionally, protein is essential for satiety and muscle maintenance, making a low-protein diet less suitable.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycaemic index (GI) is a measure used to rank carbohydrate-containing foods based on their impact on blood glucose levels. It compares the rise in blood glucose after consuming a specific amount of the food with the rise after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread, which has a reference GI value.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycemic index measures how quickly a food raises blood insulin levels compared to a reference food like white bread, reflecting the food's impact on insulin demand. Therefore, it is not just about the increase in glucose concentration but rather the relative response of blood sugar after consuming specific amounts of different foods.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting zinc absorption, leading to severe zinc deficiency. Wilson's disease involves copper accumulation, Menkes disease affects copper transport and Haemochromatosis leads to iron overload. Therefore, the correct answer is Acrodermatitis enteropathica.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wilson's disease disrupts the body's ability to process trace minerals, leading to imbalances like zinc deficiency, which can manifest in various symptoms. The other options are related to different metabolic issues: Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare genetic disorder affecting zinc absorption but not an error of metabolism; Menkes disease involves copper transportation and Haemochromatosis leads to iron overload. Therefore, the correct answer is Wilson's disease.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization often leads to increased dependence on purchased food due to limited space for growing one's own produce and less access to agricultural resources, making urban dwellers more vulnerable to fluctuations in food prices. This can exacerbate hunger and malnutrition among low-income urban populations.",C,Let's reason step by step. Urbanization doesn't significantly affect hunger and malnutrition because both urban and rural low-income populations face similar challenges in accessing nutritious food and often rely on comparable diets. The other options either overstate the impact of urbanization or focus too narrowly on specific aspects.,A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase, and glutathione peroxidase are all zinc-dependent enzymes that play crucial roles in antioxidant defense and metabolism. DNA polymerase, on the other hand, is primarily dependent on magnesium ions for its activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Alkaline phosphatase is crucial for bone health, and zinc is known to play a role in bone development and maintenance, so it's logical that alkaline phosphatase would be a zinc-dependent enzyme. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are both antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from oxidative damage; they require metal ions for their activity, with superoxide dismutase often being dependent on zinc or copper. DNA polymerase is responsible for synthesizing DNA molecules and does not typically rely on zinc as a cofactor.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA methylation is a process that modifies the function of the genes and affects gene expression. In human DNA, this modification occurs at the 5th carbon position (hence '5-methyl') on cytosine residues when they are followed by guanine in the DNA sequence (CpG sites). Therefore, among the given options, Cytosine is the nucleotide base that gets methylated at the 5' position.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Guanine forms base pairs with cytosine in DNA, and since cytosine methylation is common, it follows that guanine would also be methylated at the 5' position for proper pairing and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is guanine.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Foodborne illnesses are commonly caused by bacteria that contaminate food during processing or handling. Salmonella is a well-known cause of food poisoning, often associated with poultry and eggs. Campylobacter is another leading cause, frequently linked to raw milk and undercooked meat. These two pathogens are responsible for the majority of bacterial gastroenteritis cases in both the United States and Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Shigella and Staphylococcus are both bacteria commonly found in contaminated food and are known to cause gastrointestinal illness, making them likely culprits for foodborne outbreaks. However, Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness globally, including in the United States and Europe. Campylobacter is also a leading cause of bacterial diarrheal disease worldwide.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals due to weight loss and metabolic changes post-surgery. Studies have reported a reduction ranging from 50% to over 90%, depending on various factors such as patient characteristics, type of surgery, and follow-up duration. However, the most commonly cited range in literature is around 80-90%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control, so it's reasonable to expect a reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence by approximately 50%. This is supported by multiple studies showing substantial remission rates of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization has a significant impact on food security, particularly through trade policies and market dynamics. Wealthy nations often use subsidies and trade barriers that can hinder developing countries from fully benefiting from global markets to improve their food security. This creates an uneven playing field where the potential advantages of globalization are not equally accessible.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expansion of supermarkets into developing countries is the primary way globalization affects food security, as it introduces new food options and distribution channels. This can lead to both positive impacts such as increased availability and variety of food products, but also negative effects like undermining local markets and traditional farming practices.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nutrients can pose health risks when their intake exceeds the established Upper Levels (ULs), which are set to prevent adverse effects from excessive consumption.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Any nutrient intake exceeding the recommended levels can pose health risks because it disrupts the body's balance and can lead to toxicity or other adverse effects. The established Upper Levels (ULs) are set specifically to prevent such negative outcomes, making option A the most accurate answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination of amino acids is a process that involves the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another, which requires pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme. Pyridoxal phosphate is derived from Vitamin B6. Therefore, among the given options, Vitamin B6 is involved in transamination of amino acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is essential for energy production, and since amino acids can be used for energy, it's likely that riboflavin plays a role in amino acid transamination to facilitate their utilization as an energy source. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Research on optimal weight gain during pregnancy is indeed ongoing, as it varies based on factors like BMI and health conditions (A). Both inadequate and excessive weight gain can lead to complications for both mother and baby, such as gestational diabetes or preterm birth (B). Excessive maternal weight gain has been associated with a higher risk of obesity in offspring later in life (C). Therefore, all the given options are correct statements.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While research on optimal weight gain patterns is ongoing, it's clear that inadequate weight gain poses greater risks to maternal and infant health, as it can lead to nutrient deficiencies and developmental problems. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy has been linked with obesity in offspring due to potential changes in the intrauterine environment. Therefore, all of these statements are true.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. During prolonged high-intensity exercise, athletes need to maintain optimal blood glucose levels for sustained energy production and performance. Consuming a combination of glucose and fructose has been shown to enhance carbohydrate oxidation rates compared to consuming either sugar alone. The recommended intake is 60-90 g per hour, with the addition of fructose improving absorption and utilization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the primary fuel source for high-intensity exercise, so elite athletes should aim to consume around 60 grams of glucose per hour to maintain energy levels during prolonged activity. However, adding fructose can enhance carbohydrate oxidation and improve performance by utilizing different transport mechanisms for absorption in the gut. Therefore, a combination of glucose and fructose is more effective than consuming either one alone.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Apoproteins are protein components of lipoproteins that play essential roles in lipid metabolism. The five main series of apoproteins identified so far include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and a unique variant called apo(a). These proteins have distinct functions related to the transportation and metabolism of lipids within the body.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The five main apoprotein series are involved in lipid transport and metabolism, so it makes sense that they would include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and apoL, which are all associated with lipoproteins. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Animal growth assays, such as the PER and NPU methods using rats, have been traditionally used to evaluate protein quality but are not considered ideal models for human nutrition due to differences in amino acid requirements between species. These methods may underestimate or overestimate the quality of dietary proteins for humans. The correct statement is that animal growth assays tend to underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) assay is a reliable method for assessing protein quality because it directly measures the ability of a protein to support growth in rats, which have similar protein needs to humans. Therefore, this makes PER an appropriate model for evaluating human nutrition.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries, also known as tooth decay or cavities, are primarily caused by the acid produced from fermentable sugars by certain bacteria in dental plaque. Mutans streptococci, particularly Streptococcus mutans, is well-known for its role in initiating this process due to its ability to adhere to teeth and metabolize sugars into lactic acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lactobacilli thrive in acidic environments and are known to ferment sugars, producing lactic acid as a byproduct, which directly contributes to the demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of dental caries. While Mutans streptococci also play a role in caries initiation, Lactobacilli are primarily responsible for advancing carious lesions once they have been initiated.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Reduced energy expenditure in older adults can be attributed to several factors, including a decrease in lean body mass which leads to less muscle tissue that burns calories at rest; reduced physical activity resulting in fewer calories being used throughout the day; and a lower basal metabolic rate as the body's energy needs decline with age. Therefore, all of these factors contribute to reduced energy expenditure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason for reduced energy expenditure in older adults is the loss of lean body mass, as muscle tissue is metabolically active and contributes significantly to daily calorie burning. Additionally, physical activity tends to decrease with age, further reducing energy needs. Lastly, basal metabolic rate (BMR) also decreases due to hormonal changes and reduced cellular metabolism in older adults. Therefore, all these factors contribute to the overall reduction of energy expenditure.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe malnutrition characterized by edema, and its causes are typically related to protein deficiency or imbalanced nutrient intake. Altered composition of intestinal bacteria (A), low intake of antioxidant nutrients (B), and sudden weaning from the breast (C) have all been considered as contributing factors in the past few decades due to their impact on protein absorption or overall nutrition. However, iron deficiency (D) is more commonly associated with anemia rather than kwashiorkor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is often triggered by sudden weaning from breast milk, as the child's diet becomes deficient in protein and essential nutrients, leading to edema and other characteristic symptoms. Altered composition of intestinal bacteria and low intake of antioxidant nutrients have been associated with malnutrition conditions like kwashiorkor. However, iron deficiency is typically linked to anemia rather than the oedema seen in kwashiorkor.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia is caused by increased glucose production by the liver (A), impaired insulin secretion (B), and decreased glucose uptake from skeletal muscle (C). Since all these mechanisms contribute to hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, option D stating that 'All of the options given are correct' is not an exception. Therefore, there is no mechanism listed here that does NOT contribute to hyperglycemia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in lowering blood glucose levels, so increased glucose production by the liver wouldn't contribute to hyperglycemia. Impaired insulin secretion and decreased glucose uptake from skeletal muscle are both mechanisms that lead to elevated blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise has numerous benefits for people with diabetes, including reducing triglycerides (A), increasing insulin sensitivity (C), and helping control hypertension (D). However, hypoglycemia (B) is not a beneficial effect; it's actually a potential risk or side effect of exercise in individuals taking certain medications for diabetes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, and since triglycerides are a type of fat, it makes sense that exercise would also reduce triglycerides. Increased insulin sensitivity is another benefit as the body becomes more efficient at using available insulin to control blood glucose levels. Exercise can help manage hypertension by improving heart health and reducing stress on arteries. However, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is not a beneficial effect but rather a potential risk of exercise in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medications.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Higher sodium intake can lead to increased excretion of calcium in the urine, which may result in a negative calcium balance. This imbalance could potentially contribute to bone mineral loss over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both sodium and calcium are essential minerals involved in various physiological processes, so a higher intake of sodium would naturally lead to increased calcium excretion to maintain balance. This process can result in negative calcium balance and bone mineral loss over time.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, insulin levels rise which activates lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue to store fatty acids as triglycerides, leading to decreased plasma NEFA concentrations. This process is most active following meal consumption due to the presence of insulin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body prioritizes the breakdown of chylomicrons from dietary fat, so it would make sense that VLDL synthesis is suppressed during this time. Additionally, insulin released after eating activates lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue to store energy as fat.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase non-persisters are individuals who experience a decline in lactase production after infancy, leading to potential lactose intolerance as adults. The prevalence of lactase non-persistence varies widely across different populations and regions but is generally higher among people of East Asian descent. Considering the global distribution, approximately 70%-75% of the world's population are estimated to be lactase non-persisters.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase persistence is quite common, especially in populations with a history of dairy consumption, so the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is likely around 30-35%. This means that approximately 30% to 35% of adults globally are unable to digest lactose effectively.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are immune system reactions that occur soon after eating a certain food, even in small amounts. They typically require prior sensitization to the allergen before an individual experiences symptoms upon subsequent exposure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are dose-dependent reactions, so as long as the allergic agents are kept within specified limits, they should be avoidable. This makes option A correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rickets is a condition that affects bone development in children, and it can be caused by vitamin D deficiency or calcium/phosphate imbalances. Premature infants are at higher risk due to their underdeveloped systems and potential maternal nutrient deficiencies during pregnancy. Hypocalcaemic convulsions may occur in rickets, frusemide diuretics can exacerbate electrolyte imbalances leading to rickets-like symptoms, and vitamin D deficiency in the mother could contribute to a lack of necessary nutrients for bone development. Therefore, all options given are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Diuretics like frusemide help the body retain calcium, which is essential for bone development, so their use would be associated with a lower risk of rickets. Vitamin D deficiency in the mother can lead to insufficient vitamin D levels in the infant, increasing the risk of rickets. Hypocalcaemic convulsions are a symptom that may occur due to low calcium levels caused by rickets.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber is known to help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer as it aids in digestion and helps maintain bowel health, while alcohol consumption has been linked with an increased risk of various cancers including colorectal cancer. Vitamin C and oestrogen do not have strong evidence supporting their role in reducing colorectal cancer risk specifically.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development, so it's likely that it also has a protective effect against cancer development in the colon and rectum. Dietary fiber is known to reduce colorectal cancer risk due to its ability to promote healthy bowel movements and remove potential carcinogens from the digestive tract. Vitamin C, while beneficial for overall health, does not have a direct link to reducing colorectal cancer risk. Alcohol consumption is actually associated with an increased risk of developing various types of cancers, including colorectal cancer.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Folate deficiency can lead to anemia, and the risk increases with age due to factors like poor diet or medication interactions. Mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid has been shown to reduce the prevalence of folate deficiency in populations. Therefore, older people living in countries with mandatory fortification would be less likely to have a folate deficiency.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function and brain health, so it's logical that supplements would improve cognitive function in older people who may have deficiencies. The other options are either incorrect or not strongly supported by evidence.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plasma lipoproteins are complexes that transport lipids in the bloodstream, consisting of a hydrophilic outer layer containing proteins (apolipoproteins) and phospholipids, and a hydrophobic core primarily composed of triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. This structure allows them to be soluble in the aqueous environment of blood plasma.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phospholipids and free cholesterol are both hydrophobic molecules, so it makes sense that they would form the core of lipoproteins, surrounded by a hydrophilic shell. This structure allows them to transport lipids through the bloodstream.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of several proteins required in blood clotting, including prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X. Without adequate vitamin K, these proteins cannot be produced effectively, leading to impaired blood coagulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which help protect blood vessels and prevent damage, so it's likely involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins. However, research has shown that vitamin K plays a crucial role in activating certain proteins required for blood coagulation. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin K.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD). The diagnosis of these conditions is based on BMD measurements compared to age-matched controls, with specific thresholds for defining the severity. Option D correctly states that osteoporosis is defined as a BMD lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia is a relatively uncommon condition, so it's unlikely that more than 10% of women over 50 would have it. The statement about women over age 80 with osteopenia having above average bone mineral density contradicts the definition of osteopenia itself. Osteoporosis is indeed defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls, making option D correct.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone both increase plasma calcium levels, while calcitonin decreases it. Calcitonin acts primarily on bones to inhibit osteoclast activity and on kidneys to reduce calcium reabsorption. Therefore, the action of calcitonin on the kidney contributes to a decrease in plasma calcium concentration.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Parathyroid hormone plays a key role in regulating calcium levels, and its action on the kidney helps increase calcium reabsorption to maintain blood calcium concentration. Vitamin D also promotes calcium absorption from the intestine. Calcitonin is secreted by the thyroid gland when there's an excess of calcium in the bloodstream, and it acts on bones and kidneys to decrease plasma calcium levels.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance and body weight by inhibiting hunger. A congenital disorder impairing leptin secretion would lead to an increase in appetite, resulting in obesity due to excessive energy intake. Additionally, the lack of leptin signaling can cause abnormal growth patterns and metabolic disturbances such as hypoinsulinaemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin signals satiety and reduces appetite, so a deficiency would result in excess energy intake and obesity, but growth and insulin levels should remain normal. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen (Hydrogen-2), is a stable isotope commonly used in the measurement of total body water due to its safe nature and ability to be accurately measured through dilution techniques.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carbon 13 is a stable isotope often used in metabolic studies, so it's likely the preferred choice for measuring total body water due to its abundance and ease of detection. The other options are also stable isotopes but have different applications or less favorable properties for this specific measurement.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The critical pH for tooth enamel demineralization is the point at which acid begins to dissolve the minerals in the enamel, leading to decay. This typically occurs when the oral environment becomes too acidic due to factors like diet and bacterial activity. Research has shown that this critical pH level for enamel demineralization is around 5.5.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tooth enamel starts to demineralize at a pH below neutral 7, and considering the acidic environment of the mouth, the critical pH is likely around 5.7. This value represents the threshold where hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel begin to dissolve.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) is the ratio of carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) to oxygen consumed (VO2). It reflects the type of substrate being metabolized for energy, with carbohydrates having an RQ close to 1.0 and fats closer to 0.7. Therefore, on a high carbohydrate diet, RQ would increase rather than decrease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) measures the ratio of oxygen consumed (VO2) to carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) during metabolism. It reflects the type of substrate being used for energy production, with carbohydrates having an RQ close to 1.0 and fats closer to 0.7. Therefore, a high carbohydrate diet would not decrease but rather increase or maintain the RQ around 1.0.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The glycemic index (GI) measures how quickly a food raises blood sugar levels after consumption. Raw fruits generally have lower GIs than cooked or processed forms due to their higher fiber content and intact cellular structure, which slows down digestion and glucose release. Among the options given, raw apples would likely have the lowest glycemic index because they are less processed compared to baked apple or apple juice, and potatoes generally have a higher GI than fruits.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Raw fruits typically have more fiber and are digested more slowly than cooked fruits, so a raw apple would have a lower glycemic index than a baked apple. A raw potato has a higher starch content compared to an apple but is still less processed than juice. Apple juice lacks the fiber found in whole apples and is more rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in a higher glycemic index.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Infections and inflammatory states trigger the body's acute phase response, which includes alterations in protein synthesis and redistribution of nutrients to support immune function. This can lead to changes in the concentration of micronutrients in plasma or serum, making biochemical indices less reliable for assessing true micronutrient status.",D,"Let's reason step by step. People who are sick often experience changes in appetite and dietary intake, which can directly affect their micronutrient status and lead to misleading results in biochemical tests. Additionally, the body's response to illness or inflammation may alter metabolic pathways and nutrient distribution within tissues.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational epidemiology is useful for identifying associations between exposures and health outcomes, but it lacks the ability to establish causality due to confounding factors and lack of control over variables. Reliable dose-response data are crucial for risk assessment as they help determine safe levels of exposure. Since such data are often difficult to acquire or unavailable in observational studies, this limits their utility in accurately assessing risks associated with food contaminants.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies are inherently limited by their inability to control for all confounding factors, so it's impossible to definitively prove that observed effects are caused by the contaminant in question. However, this limitation does not preclude them from identifying potential health effects of food contaminants. The key issue with observational studies is acquiring reliable dose-response data, which is crucial for risk assessment but often unavailable or difficult to obtain.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy needs of a sedentary individual can be estimated using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation: BMR = (10 * weight in kg) + (6.25 * height in cm) - (5 * age in years) - 161 for women. Assuming an average height, we get approximately 1387 kcal/day as the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). Considering a sedentary lifestyle with little to no exercise, the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is typically BMR * 1.2. This results in around 1664 kcal/day. The closest answer choice that accounts for individual variations and rounding is C: 1525 kcal/day.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A sedentary lifestyle implies minimal energy expenditure, so the daily caloric requirement should be relatively low, around 1250 kcal. Using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for women (BMR = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) - 5 * age(y) - 161), we can estimate a basal metabolic rate, but without her height and assuming an average sedentary lifestyle multiplier of around 1.2, the closest answer is approximately 1300 kcal/day.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In terms of price per calorie, a slice of bread generally offers more calories for less cost compared to the other options. Additionally, it provides essential nutrients such as carbohydrates and some B vitamins. While apples are healthy, they have fewer calories; cheeseburgers may be high in calories but also come with higher costs and unhealthy fats; broccoli is nutritious but low in calories.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable and is often affordable, making it a good candidate for the cheapest and most nutritious option. Apples are also relatively cheap but may not provide as many essential nutrients per calorie compared to broccoli. Bread provides carbohydrates but lacks significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. Cheeseburgers, while providing protein and some micronutrients, tend to be higher in cost due to the meat content and are less nutritious per calorie compared to broccoli.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. While all the listed substances can be consumed in excess, Vitamin A is known to cause hypervitaminosis when taken well above recommended daily requirements. This condition can lead to serious health issues such as liver damage and central nervous system disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and calcium absorption, so consuming more than the recommended amount should be beneficial. However, excessive intake of vitamins C, zinc, or A can lead to adverse effects such as kidney stones (vitamin C), copper deficiency (zinc), and liver damage (vitamin A). Therefore, Vitamin D is the substance that could be consumed in excess without immediate harmful consequences.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced by certain types of molds, which are a kind of fungus. These mycotoxins can contaminate food products when they are stored under conditions that favor the growth of these molds, typically in warm and moist environments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bacteria thrive in dry environments, and mycotoxins are harmful substances, so contaminated foods likely contain bacteria formed under dry conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is that mycotoxins contaminate foods containing bacteria formed during storage under dry conditions.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Women play a multifaceted role in food security, not limited to meal preparation or specific tasks based on gender stereotypes. They are involved in various aspects of agriculture and household management, including production, resource management, income generation, and ensuring nutritional needs are met for their families.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditionally, men perform physically demanding tasks like ploughing and planting, while women engage in lighter activities like weeding. However, the central role of women extends beyond these traditional roles to include food production, resource management, income generation, and ensuring household nutrition.",B

Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium from the small intestine, as it helps to maintain normal blood levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are critical for bone health. The other vitamins listed do not have this specific role in calcium absorption.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including bone health, so it's likely involved in calcium absorption.

It helps maintain proper levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood, which are critical for normal mineralization of bone.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of every cell, particularly affecting DNA synthesis and regulation as well as fatty acid synthesis and energy production. One of its key functions is to act as a coenzyme for methionine synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Therefore, the correct answer is related to this process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function, and neurotransmitters are essential for nerve signaling, so B12 must be involved in their synthesis.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot synthesize on its own and must be obtained through diet. Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid, while methionine and threonine are also considered essential because they play critical roles in various metabolic processes and protein synthesis. Therefore, option A contains all essential amino acids.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Valine and arginine are commonly found in protein-rich foods, and glycine is a simple amino acid, so they are likely essential components of the diet. However, leucine is also an essential amino acid that must be obtained from the diet as it cannot be synthesized by the body. Therefore, option A (leucine, methionine and threonine) contains three essential amino acids.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements to food refer to the various ways individuals can access and secure their right to adequate food, which includes production, purchase, social protection programs, or other means.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements typically refer to social welfare programs, so the term likely relates to initiatives like Fair Price food shops that provide subsidized food. This aligns best with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, and it primarily depends on lean body mass rather than fat mass. Lean tissue has more metabolically active cells compared to adipose tissue, which means that individuals with higher lean mass will have a higher BMR. Therefore, the correct answer is lean mass (fat-free mass).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen stores energy in the body, and obese individuals have more stored energy, so their higher BMR is likely due to increased glycogen levels. Additionally, water content can also contribute to weight differences between lean and obese people.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density and weakened bones, increasing the risk of fractures. High body weight can actually be protective due to increased mechanical loading on bones, while high lean mass may contribute positively as well. Poor muscle strength increases the likelihood of falls, which in turn raises the risk of osteoporotic fractures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lean mass contributes to overall body weight, and higher body weight is generally associated with stronger bones, thus reducing fracture risk. High bone mineral density also indicates strong bones that are less likely to break. However, poor muscle strength can lead to falls and subsequent fractures due to inadequate support for the skeletal system.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Underwater weighing, also known as hydrostatic weighing, is a method that measures body density and from there calculates body composition (fat vs lean mass). It directly assesses the proportion of fat in the body compared to other methods listed which are indirect or do not measure body composition accurately.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The skinfold test directly measures subcutaneous fat, which is a key component of body composition, making it the most direct method. Underwater weighing and BMI are indirect methods that estimate body composition based on weight and height or density. Weight alone does not provide information about body composition.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Severe acute malnutrition in young children is characterized by a combination of anthropometric measurements and clinical signs. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as either a very low weight-for-height Z score (<-3), indicating wasting, or the presence of nutritional edema. Therefore, the correct answer includes both criteria.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Severe acute malnutrition indicates significant undernourishment, so it must involve low weight-for-age, height-for-age, or edema. The correct definition includes any of these three conditions: a very low weight for height (wasting), a very low height for age (stunting), or the presence of oedema due to protein deficiency.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin is a coenzyme that plays an essential role in carboxylation reactions, which involve the addition of carbon dioxide to various substrates. Among the given options, only option C describes a carboxylation reaction where biotin assists in converting pyruvate into oxaloacetate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin is a B vitamin, and some B vitamins like B6 are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, so biotin likely plays a similar role. However, the primary function of biotin involves carboxylation reactions where it acts as a coenzyme for enzymes that transfer carbon dioxide to substrates. This is crucial in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Worldwide HIV/AIDS campaigns have focused on prevention, education, and treatment accessibility improvements over the years. These efforts have led to a decrease in new HIV infections globally, including Europe. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that HIV infection rates in Europe have been significantly decreasing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS campaigns have made progress globally, but specific data on European infection rates might not be readily available, making the current trend unknown. Therefore, while there may be general knowledge about global trends, without explicit information for Europe, we cannot definitively say if rates are decreasing, unchanged, or increasing.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids are a diverse group of phytonutrients found in many fruits and vegetables, but they do not include isoflavonoids as a separate class; rather, isoflavonoids are a subclass within the flavonoid family. Processing can indeed affect the digestibility and bioavailability of isoflavones. \u00df-Carotene acts as provitamin A but lycopene does not have this function. Carotenoids and flavonoids belong to different classes; carotenoids are tetraterpenes, while flavonoids are polyphenols.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both carotenoids and flavonoids contribute to the vibrant colors of fruits and vegetables, suggesting they belong to the same class of polyphenols. However, this is incorrect as carotenoids are a separate group from flavonoids.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Free sugars are monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit concentrates. Cows' milk contains lactose, a natural sugar but not considered a free sugar because it is intrinsic to the milk itself. Natural unsweetened orange juice has fructose, which is also a natural sugar found in whole fruit; however, when extracted as juice without added sugars, it does not count as 'free' sugar. Honey and agave nectar are both high in free sugars.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Honey is a natural product and is often considered a healthier alternative to processed sugars, so it likely doesn't contain free sugars. However, honey actually contains fructose and glucose which are types of free sugars. Agave nectar also contains high amounts of fructose, making it another source of free sugar. Natural unsweetened orange juice does have some natural sugars but these aren't considered 'free sugars'. Cows' milk naturally contains lactose, which is a type of sugar; however, in the context of this question and common definitions, cows' milk isn't typically classified as containing free sugars. Therefore, the correct answer would be cows' milk.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. High intake of salt and salt-preserved foods has been linked to an increased risk of stomach cancer due to the potential damage they can cause to the gastric mucosa, leading to inflammation and possibly cancerous changes over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a risk factor for several health problems, including some cancers, so it's likely associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer as well. Sugar intake has been linked to obesity and other diseases but not directly to stomach cancer. Dietary fibre generally reduces the risk of various types of cancer. However, high salt consumption and consuming salt-preserved foods have been specifically associated with an increased risk of gastric (stomach) cancer due to their potential to damage the lining of the stomach.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. L-carnitine is metabolized by gut microbes into trimethylamine (TMA), which is then converted in the liver to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Elevated levels of TMAO have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the correct answer is Trimethylamine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The gut microbes metabolize L-carnitine into various compounds, and if one metabolite increases cardiovascular disease risk, the others likely do as well. Among the options given, Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a known byproduct of this process that has been linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium is an essential mineral for bone health and other physiological functions. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of calcium for most adults ranges from 1000mg to 1300mg, which contradicts option A. Activated Vitamin D actually enhances the absorption of dietary calcium, making option B incorrect. Option C is supported by numerous studies showing that higher calcium intake can reduce the risk of bone fractures. Lastly, while it's true that absorption efficiency may vary with intake levels, this statement doesn't provide a clear relationship as described in option D.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Activated Vitamin D regulates calcium levels, so it might reduce calcium absorption to prevent excessive buildup in the body. However, its primary role is actually to increase calcium absorption from the gut and reabsorption from kidneys, which contradicts option B. Option A underestimates typical adult dietary calcium intake significantly. The correct answer is D because it's well-documented that when dietary calcium intake is low, the body compensates by increasing absorption efficiency to maintain necessary levels.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that there is a link between maternal nutrition, early experience, and later health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. This implies that events before birth and in the early postnatal period can have long-lasting effects on physiology. Therefore, option D best captures this idea.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While early life experiences may play a role, the impact of adult lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, is likely more significant in determining long-term health outcomes. Additionally, epidemiological studies have shown links between early experience and later health across various populations, not just limited to UK studies. The evidence suggests that programmed differences in physiology are influenced by events before birth and during early postnatal life.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. BED stands for Binge Eating Disorder, which is primarily treated with psychological interventions and medications that target the underlying issues of eating behavior and mood regulation. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in treating BED by addressing dysfunctional thoughts and behaviors related to food. Antidepressants like Fluoxetine and Sertraline have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing binge eating episodes. However, Benzodiazepines are primarily used for anxiety disorders and do not directly target the mechanisms of BED.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Antidepressants, like Fluoxetine and Sertraline, are commonly used to treat mental health disorders, and since BED often involves emotional and psychological components, they would be effective in managing the condition. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for eating disorders including BED due to its focus on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors related to food. Antiobesity agents like Orlistat and Sibutramine are used primarily to manage weight, which can be beneficial in treating the physical aspects of BED. However, Benzodiazepines such as Diazepam and Alprazolam are not typically indicated for BED treatment; they're more commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is involved in various enzymatic reactions related to amino acid metabolism. One of its key functions includes the decarboxylation of certain amino acids to form neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is crucial for amino acid metabolism, and since methionine is an amino acid synthesized from homocysteine, it's likely that B6 plays a role in this conversion process. The other options are related to different vitamins or processes not directly associated with Vitamin B6.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant proteins can vary in their amino acid profiles, but not all of them lack essential amino acids. Some plant-based protein sources may have lower amounts of certain essential amino acids compared to animal proteins, but they typically contain all the essential amino acids required for human nutrition. Therefore, option B is correct as it acknowledges that while some plant proteins might be limited in specific amino acids, they still provide a complete set.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based proteins often lack certain essential amino acids, and sulfur-containing amino acids, like methionine and cysteine, are commonly deficient in plant sources. However, not all plant protein sources are universally deficient in lysine or limited to specific amino acids; some legumes, for example, have a more balanced profile.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The main nitrogenous compound in urine is the one that results from protein metabolism and is excreted by the kidneys to maintain homeostasis. Urea, produced in the liver through the urea cycle, is the primary waste product of protein catabolism and constitutes a significant portion of the nitrogenous compounds found in urine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is a waste product of protein breakdown, and since urine is a primary route for eliminating waste products, ammonia would be the main nitrogenous compound found in urine. However, most mammals convert ammonia into urea because it's less toxic and more water-soluble, making it easier to excrete through urine.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided guidelines on sugar intake to reduce the risk of noncommunicable diseases such as obesity and dental caries. According to their recommendations, free sugars should make up less than 10% of total energy intake for adults and children.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The WHO aims to promote healthy dietary habits, and excessive sugar intake is linked to various health issues. Therefore, their recommendation would likely set a very low limit, such as less than 5%, for daily free sugar consumption. This aligns with the goal of reducing non-communicable diseases like obesity and dental caries.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Bulimia Nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, or excessive exercise. Patients with bulimia nervosa typically have a normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m^2), and the disorder is more common in females than males. Some patients may engage in purging behaviors without binge eating episodes, but this is not typical of Bulimia Nervosa.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Eating disorders stem from a complex interplay of factors, including societal pressures and body image issues, which affect individuals of all genders. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect a similar prevalence of Bulimia Nervosa in both men and women. The other options are incorrect: A is more characteristic of Anorexia Nervosa; C describes a subtype called Purging Disorder rather than Bulimia Nervosa; D, while common, isn't the defining feature as purging can also include excessive exercise or misuse of laxatives.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for several chronic diseases due to its impact on metabolism, inflammation, and hormonal balance. It significantly increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, various forms of cancer (such as breast, colon, and endometrial), and cardiovascular disease by contributing to hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, due to its effects on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and inflammation. It also increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes through insulin resistance. Furthermore, obesity has been linked with an increased risk for certain types of cancer, including breast, colon, and kidney cancers. Therefore, all options given are correct.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing in East Asians is commonly associated with a deficiency of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which plays a role in alcohol metabolism. This genetic variation leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, causing facial flushing and other symptoms after consuming alcohol.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing is related to alcohol metabolism, and aldehyde dehydrogenases are enzymes involved in this process. So, a deficiency in ALDH4, which is involved in aldehyde metabolism, could explain the flushing response. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant that protects cell membranes from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of cells and preventing oxidative stress.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is known to have numerous health benefits and plays a role in various bodily functions. Given its importance in maintaining overall health, it's likely that it also acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Therefore, the correct answer is vitamin D.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The oral phase of digestion involves chewing and swallowing, with energy expenditure during these actions (A). Swallowing does involve multiple muscle groups contracting and relaxing in a short time frame (B). Salivary biofilm on tooth enamel contains various salivary and bacterial enzymes (C). However, the incorrect statement is that salivary amylase digests dextran film formed from dietary sucrose. Amylase breaks down starch into sugars but does not act on dextran.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Chewing and swallowing involve muscular activity, which requires energy. Considering the effort involved in these actions, it's plausible that a significant portion, around 2%, of the energy content of food is expended during the oral phase of digestion. Swallowing indeed involves complex muscle contractions and relaxations to move food from the mouth to the esophagus. The biofilm on teeth does contain salivary enzymes but not bacterial ones, as it's primarily composed of proteins secreted by glands in the oral cavity. Salivary amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars and doesn't digest dextran films on tooth enamel formed from dietary sucrose.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Athletes require more dietary protein than sedentary individuals to support muscle repair, growth, and overall recovery from training. The recommended range for athletes is typically between 1.2-2.0 g of protein per kg bodyweight per day depending on the intensity and type of sport. Therefore, option C falls within this recommended range.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Athletes engage in intense physical activity and require more protein than sedentary individuals to build and repair muscle tissues. Therefore, their daily protein intake should exceed 2.0 g per kg of body weight to meet their increased needs. Hence, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for calculating BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m^2). For a patient with a height of 1.75 m and a weight of 99 kg, the calculation would be: 99 / (1.75 * 1.75) = 32.4. The closest answer to this result is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. For this patient, that would be 99 kg / (1.75 m)^2, which is approximately 29.06. Therefore, the closest answer choice to the actual BMI value is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Homocysteine is an amino acid that can be metabolized through pathways involving folate (vitamin B9), vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. Elevated levels of homocysteine are associated with cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the correct answer would involve these specific vitamins.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Given its involvement in metabolic processes, it's possible that it also plays a role in lowering homocysteine levels. However, the most direct impact on homocysteine metabolism comes from vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism pathways: Folate (B9), Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. After eating breakfast, the body digests carbohydrates from toast and protein from the egg into glucose and amino acids respectively. Alanine is an amino acid that can be produced during fasting or exercise but not significantly increased after a meal. Glucose levels rise post-meal due to carbohydrate digestion, while ketone bodies are typically elevated during fasting when the body uses fat for energy. Non-esterified (free) fatty acids decrease as they're used up or stored after eating.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ketone bodies are produced when the body utilizes fat for energy, which typically occurs during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake. However, after consuming a meal with carbohydrates, the body will prioritize glucose as an energy source, leading to an increase in ketone body production. Therefore, the concentration of ketone bodies would be higher than before breakfast.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Options B, C and D are all factors that can contribute to vitamin or mineral deficiencies in older people. However, option A refers to low income which is not typically a problem for older individuals living in high-income countries. Therefore, it does not explain an increased risk of nutrient deficiencies among this population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Intrinsic factor is essential for nutrient absorption in the stomach. As people age, the production of intrinsic factor declines, which can lead to deficiencies in various vitamins and minerals. However, this decrease in intrinsic factor would not be a reason specific to older people living in high-income countries as it is related to aging itself rather than socioeconomic factors.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that reduced exposure to microbes in early childhood due to improved sanitary conditions and smaller family sizes may lead to an increased risk of allergies, as the immune system does not develop properly without these challenges. Living on a working farm exposes individuals to a variety of microbes, which can help build a more robust immune response and potentially reduce the development of atopic diseases.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that early exposure to microbes is crucial for developing a healthy immune system. Therefore, for high-risk infants, it's important to maintain strict hygiene during breastfeeding to minimize exposure to potential allergens. This aligns with the idea of reducing allergy development through controlled environmental factors.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology focuses on understanding how diet and nutrition affect health outcomes in populations, including both disease causation and promotion of good health through changes in food intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology primarily investigates the role of diet in disease development and the negative health consequences of poor nutrition within populations. It also explores how changes in food intake can promote good health, prevent diseases, and improve overall well-being.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nutrition transition refers to the shift in dietary consumption and energy expenditure that coincides with economic, demographic, and epidemiological changes. Among the options provided, China has experienced rapid urbanization, increased income levels, and a significant change in lifestyle over the last two decades, leading to a substantial nutrition transition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sweden is known for its emphasis on health and well-being, with progressive policies promoting healthy lifestyles and sustainable food systems. This suggests that Sweden has likely experienced a rapid nutrition transition in recent decades. In contrast, China, Britain, and India have also undergone significant changes but may not match the pace of transformation seen in Sweden.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The pancreas secretes various digestive enzymes, including trypsinogen which needs activation. Enteropeptidase is an enzyme found on the surface of cells in the duodenum that activates trypsinogen to trypsin by cleaving a specific peptide sequence. This process allows for protein digestion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pancreatic α-amylase is a key enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion. It breaks down complex starches into simpler sugars, ultimately leading to the production of free glucose molecules. The other options are incorrect: Pepsinogen (A) is secreted by the stomach, not the pancreas; enteropeptidase (C) activates trypsin from trypsinogen but doesn't directly relate to digestive enzymes after a meal; and hydrochloric acid (D) is produced in the stomach, not by the pancreas.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Macrobiotic and vegan diets are plant-based, focusing on whole grains, vegetables, and legumes while avoiding animal products. These diets tend to be high in fiber due to the emphasis on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains (B). They also typically have low energy density because they consist of foods that are less calorie-dense but more filling (D). However, not all vegan or macrobiotic diets are necessarily low in fat; some may include nuts, seeds, and avocados which can be high in healthy fats. Therefore, the statement 'Low in fat' is not always true for these diets.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Macrobiotic and vegan diets are typically low in processed foods and refined sugars, which are major contributors to energy density. They also tend to be high in fiber due to the consumption of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. However, they can vary in fat content depending on the specific choices within these diets; some vegan or macrobiotic options may include higher-fat foods like nuts and seeds. Therefore, stating that these diets are universally low in fat is not necessarily true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Type IIb muscle fibers, also known as fast glycolytic fibers, are characterized by their high contraction speed and low oxidative capacity due to a limited number of mitochondria. They have high motor unit strength but fatigue quickly because they rely on anaerobic metabolism for energy production. Therefore, the characteristic not representative of type IIb muscle fibers is 'High fatigue resistance'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Type IIb muscle fibers are known for their rapid and powerful contractions, suggesting a high motor unit strength to generate those forceful movements. They also have fast contractile speeds due to the quick response of these fibers during intense activities. However, they possess low oxidative capacity because they rely more on anaerobic metabolism for energy production and are not designed for endurance or fatigue resistance.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Measuring a specific biochemical status index for a micronutrient like vitamin C is primarily aimed at assessing the nutritional adequacy of that particular nutrient in an individual's body, rather than evaluating overall diet quality or general health. This measurement helps to determine if there are sufficient levels of the nutrient available for physiological functions and can indicate a risk of deficiency-related conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A balanced micronutrient status is crucial for various physiological functions, contributing significantly to overall health and disease prevention. However, the measurement of a specific biochemical status index like vitamin C primarily provides information about tissue levels or body status of that nutrient rather than directly indicating diet quality, clinical deficiency risk, or general health.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Postmenopausal breast cancer risk is influenced by various factors, including diet and body weight. Research has shown that obesity increases the levels of estrogen in postmenopausal women due to adipose tissue acting as an estrogen producer, which can promote the development of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Therefore, among the given options, obesity is a known risk factor for increasing the likelihood of developing postmenopausal breast cancer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Red meat is often high in saturated fats and heme iron, both of which have been linked to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially promoting cancer development. Dietary fat has also been associated with breast cancer risk due to its effect on estrogen levels. Fish, however, is generally considered beneficial for health and not a significant risk factor. Obesity is known to increase the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer as it leads to higher circulating estrogen levels from adipose tissue.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose neurotoxicity, insulin insensitivity, and systemic inflammation are all mechanisms that have been linked to accelerated age-related cognitive decline according to medical knowledge as of 2020. Each of these factors can individually contribute to the deterioration of brain function over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin resistance can impair glucose uptake in the brain, leading to energy deficits and neuronal dysfunction, which directly contribute to cognitive decline. Systemic inflammation is known to affect brain function negatively through various pathways including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Glucose neurotoxicity can also damage neurons by inducing excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Therefore, all these mechanisms potentially accelerate age-related cognitive decline.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes protein synthesis and is secreted during the fed state, while glucagon opposes insulin's actions in the fasting state. Lysine availability can contribute to protein synthesis but isn't directly related to rate changes. Cortisol generally has catabolic effects on tissue proteins. Therefore, increased insulin secretion during the fed state would most likely result in an increase in the rate of tissue protein synthesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is released during stress to mobilize energy resources, which includes promoting protein synthesis to repair and rebuild tissues. Increased insulin secretion in the fed state also stimulates protein synthesis as it signals nutrient availability for growth and repair processes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Histones are proteins that package and order DNA into structural units called nucleosomes, which help in the regulation of gene expression. They play a crucial role in chromatin structure and function within the cell nucleus.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Histones are integral components of chromatin structure, directly interacting with DNA strands and influencing gene expression, similar to how nucleotides function in genetic coding. However, histones themselves are not the building blocks of DNA or RNA but rather proteins that package and order these nucleic acids into structural units called nucleosomes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. High glycaemic index carbohydrates can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels, which may contribute to cognitive decline over time. A high n-6:n-3 fat ratio has been associated with inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Long chain saturated fats have also been linked to poorer brain health and increased risk of cognitive decline. Therefore, all these dietary components can predispose an individual to accelerated cognitive decline.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Long-chain saturated fats can impair blood flow and promote inflammation in the brain, negatively impacting cognitive processes and increasing the risk of dementia. High glycaemic index carbohydrates may lead to insulin resistance which is associated with cognitive decline. A high n-6:n-3 fat ratio can promote inflammation, potentially affecting brain health negatively. Therefore, all these dietary components could contribute to accelerated cognitive decline.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer due to its role in cellular proliferation and anti-apoptotic effects, which can contribute to tumorigenesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is a known carcinogen, causing cellular damage and genetic mutations that can contribute to the development of various cancers, including prostate cancer. While dietary fat has been studied for its potential link with prostate cancer risk, evidence remains inconclusive. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is associated with cellular growth and may play a role in cancer development; however, the direct association between IGF-1 levels and increased prostate cancer risk isn't as strong as that of alcohol consumption.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrites are commonly used as preservatives in processed meats due to their ability to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria, particularly Clostridium botulinum which causes botulism. This makes option B the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrites are commonly used as food preservatives to inhibit the growth of bacteria, including Salmonella, which can cause foodborne illness. The other genera listed have different characteristics and may not be primarily targeted by nitrite addition.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as certain amino acids. Leucine is a ketogenic amino acid and cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Isoleucine, like many other amino acids, can be broken down into metabolic intermediates that feed into the gluconeogenesis pathway, contributing to glucose production. However, leucine is unique among the branched-chain amino acids as it cannot contribute to gluconeogenesis because its catabolism leads directly to acetyl-CoA and does not intersect with the gluconeogenic pathway.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids play multiple roles in the body including being oxidized by cells to provide energy, participating in neuroendocrine regulation of appetite and influencing gastrointestinal functions such as stomach emptying, gall bladder contraction, and intestinal motility. Therefore, all listed options are correct roles of fatty acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids act as signaling molecules in the body, influencing various physiological processes such as digestion, appetite regulation, and cell growth. They are oxidized to provide energy for cells (A), involved in neuroendocrine regulation of appetite (B), and influence gastrointestinal functions like stomach emptying and gall bladder contraction (C). Therefore, all the options listed contribute to the roles of fatty acids.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Food balance sheets have limitations such as not accounting for waste or losses (A), potentially overestimating consumption compared to other surveys (B), and lacking information on within-country distribution of food consumption (C). Therefore, all the options given are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Food balance sheets offer reliable estimates of food consumption patterns, often exceeding those obtained from individual dietary surveys due to their comprehensive nature. However, they do not account for waste or losses in the supply chain (A), and lack detailed information on how food is distributed among different population groups within a country (C). Therefore, both A and C are limitations of food balance sheets.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Starch consists primarily of two types of molecules: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear polymer made up of glucose units linked together through alpha 1,4-glycosidic bonds. Therefore, the correct statement should mention that starch contains amylose as a polymer of glucose with alpha 1,4-linkages.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Amylose, the primary constituent of starch, is a polymer of fructose molecules connected by beta 1,4-glycosidic linkages, similar to cellulose. However, in this case, amylose is actually composed of glucose units with alpha 1,4-linkages, not fructose or beta linkages.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Prenatal programming refers to the concept that environmental factors during pregnancy can influence the development and health of the fetus, potentially leading to long-term effects on the child's risk for various conditions. Among these options, epigenetic changes due to intrauterine nutritional inadequacy are well-documented mechanisms through which prenatal programming may occur.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The effects of prenatal programming are primarily observed in low birth weight babies, who are more susceptible to long-term health consequences due to their compromised early development. This includes the potential for epigenetic changes resulting from intrauterine nutritional deficiencies that can affect gene expression and lead to various health issues later in life.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified (GM) foods have been engineered for various benefits such as increased yield, resistance to pests and diseases, and improved nutritional content. These modifications can contribute to a more abundant and economical food supply while potentially enhancing the resilience of crops against climate change impacts. Therefore, GM foods could be valuable tools in addressing global food security challenges.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified foods raise concerns regarding potential long-term health effects, such as cancer development, making them less desirable to consumers. While they may offer benefits like increased yield and improved nutritional quality, the uncertainty surrounding their safety outweighs these advantages in addressing global food security and climate change.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own pancreatic beta cells, leading to a lack of insulin production. In contrast, type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance and often still has some endogenous insulin production. Autoimmune factors are not involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Individuals with type 1 diabetes can manage their blood sugar levels by taking oral hypoglycemic agents, which promote insulin secretion from the pancreas. However, this is not true as individuals with type 1 diabetes have an autoimmune destruction of beta cells in the pancreas and cannot produce endogenous insulin.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Childhood stunting, which is a result of chronic malnutrition during critical periods of growth and development, has been shown to have long-term effects on cognitive performance due to its impact on brain development. While it may also affect short-term cognitive abilities, the most significant and well-documented consequences are observed in the long term.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Childhood stunting primarily affects cognitive performance in the short term, during the period of growth faltering, but these effects tend to diminish over time. However, there is evidence that early-life malnutrition can have lasting impacts on brain development and function, potentially influencing long-term cognitive outcomes as well.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Family history, being overweight, and high intake of dietary fat are all recognized risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, considering that each option is a valid risk factor, the correct answer encompasses all listed options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A high intake of dietary fat, especially saturated and trans fats, promotes insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor as it leads to increased insulin resistance. Additionally, having a family history of diabetes suggests a genetic predisposition to developing the condition. Therefore, all listed options are recognized risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water through glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation yields a total of 32 ATP molecules per glucose molecule under ideal conditions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of glucose through glycolysis generates a net gain of 2 ATP molecules, contributing to the overall energy production from glucose metabolism. In addition, oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria produces approximately 34 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Therefore, when considering both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, the total yield of ATP is around 36 (2 from glycolysis + 34 from oxidative phosphorylation). However, due to losses in transporting NADH into mitochondria, this number can be slightly lower. The closest answer choice that represents this overall yield is 32.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to influence DNA methylation, which plays a crucial role in gene expression and development. Specifically, studies have demonstrated that folic acid can affect the methylation of imprinted genes like IGF2 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 2). The supplementation is known to decrease the methylation levels of IGF2 in offspring. Therefore, the correct answer is that folic acid supplementation leads to decreased methylation of the imprinted gene IGF2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid plays a crucial role in hormonal balance, and sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone can influence gene expression, including methylation patterns. However, the primary function of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is to prevent neural tube defects rather than directly affecting imprinted genes such as IGF2. Therefore, there's no direct evidence suggesting that folic acid supplementation would specifically alter methylation patterns of IGF2 in the resulting children.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which can be reduced with age. Atrophic gastritis also affects older adults and impairs vitamin B12 absorption. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with atrophic gastritis and can further contribute to deficiency. Therefore, all the options listed are factors that contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Atrophic gastritis, characterized by inflammation and thinning of the stomach lining, directly impairs the absorption of vitamin B12, leading to deficiency. Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption in the small intestine, also contributes significantly to this condition. Additionally, Helicobacter pylori infection can cause atrophic gastritis and reduce intrinsic factor production. Therefore, all these factors collectively contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Infants and children have higher growth rates, requiring more energy for development compared to young adults or the elderly. Therefore, they do not necessarily need the most protein-dense food but rather a balanced diet with adequate protein relative to their energy needs. The correct answer is that infants and children need sufficient protein in relation to their higher overall energy requirements.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Young adults typically engage in activities that require more muscle mass and energy expenditure, hence their higher need for protein-dense food. Infants and children are growing rapidly but do not have the same level of physical activity as young adults. The elderly may require a higher protein intake to prevent sarcopenia, but they generally consume less due to decreased appetite or dietary restrictions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination is the process of transferring an amino group to a keto acid, forming new amino acids and facilitating their catabolism or synthesis. This reaction is reversible and requires pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme, which is derived from vitamin B6.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for various metabolic processes, including enzyme activity, and its deficiency can lead to impaired amino acid metabolism. However, transamination reactions specifically require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate), not vitamin B12.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Engel's law states that as a household's income increases, the percentage of income allocated to food expenditure decreases because basic needs are met and additional income is used for other goods or services.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As income increases, people have more disposable income to allocate to various goods and services, including a greater variety and quantity of food. However, Engel's law states that the proportion of income spent on food decreases as income rises because basic needs are met first, and additional income is used for other expenditures.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that regulates appetite and metabolism, signaling satiety to the brain. In leptin resistance, despite high levels of circulating leptin due to increased fat mass, the body does not respond effectively to its signals, leading to continued food intake and reduced energy expenditure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin resistance implies a failure of adipose tissue to adequately release leptin, a hormone that signals satiety and regulates energy balance. However, despite high concentrations of circulating leptin in the bloodstream, there is no reduction in appetite or energy intake due to this resistance.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. EPA and DHA are long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that play a crucial role in brain development, particularly during pregnancy and infancy. They have been shown to support cognitive function and visual performance due to their involvement in the structure of cell membranes in the retina and brain.",A,"Let's reason step by step. EPA and DHA are crucial components of brain cell membranes and play a vital role in neuronal communication and signal transduction, which are essential for motor function. Studies have shown that supplementation with these long-chain fatty acids during pregnancy and infancy can improve infant visual performance, but the most significant benefits are observed in motor development.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is a vital nutrient that needs to be transported in the bloodstream from the intestine, where it is absorbed, to various tissues for metabolic processes. However, free iron (Fe2+) can catalyze harmful reactions and thus must be bound to a carrier protein. Transferrin is the primary iron-binding glycoprotein in the blood that safely transports iron ions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron exists in its ferrous (Fe2+) form in the blood and readily dissolves in serum, allowing for efficient transport to tissues. However, free iron can be potentially harmful due to its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. To prevent this, iron is bound to a specific protein called transferrin that safely transports it from the intestine to various metabolic sites throughout the body.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels and promotes the storage of glucose in cells, as well as fat synthesis while inhibiting lipolysis (fat breakdown). In insulin deficiency, such as in type 1 diabetes, there's an increase in lipolysis due to lack of insulin's inhibitory effect. This leads to increased levels of free fatty acids and their conversion into ketone bodies through a process called ketogenesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes energy storage, including the uptake and storage of glucose and fatty acids, thus reducing the need for lipolysis. In insulin deficiency, such as in type 1 diabetes, there is an increased breakdown of fats leading to elevated levels of free fatty acids in the bloodstream. These are then converted into ketone bodies through a process called ketogenesis.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Agricultural research aimed at addressing the challenges faced by poor farmers and consumers is considered a 'public good', as it benefits society but may not yield high profits for private entities. This type of research can lead to improved crop yields, disease resistance, and sustainable practices that directly impact food security and poverty reduction. Public investment in such research ensures its continuation and relevance to those who need it most.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Organic farming methods, which emphasize natural processes and avoid synthetic inputs, are crucial for promoting sustainable agriculture and improving livelihoods in impoverished communities. By focusing on organic practices, research can help reduce hunger and poverty through increased food security, improved soil health, reduced input costs, and enhanced resilience to climate change.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a precursor for the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These coenzymes are essential in various redox reactions, including those involved in fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, riboflavin is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin, in its coenzyme forms, participates in various metabolic reactions, including those involving electron transfer, which are essential for fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is riboflavin.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen metabolism involves both synthesis (glycogenesis) and breakdown (glycogenolysis). UDP-glucose is indeed a key intermediate in the synthesis of glycogen, making option A correct. In muscle cells during fasting, glycogen breaks down to glucose 6-phosphate but not free glucose due to lack of glucose-6-phosphatase (option B is incorrect). Glycogen is mainly stored in the liver and skeletal muscles, not the brain (option C is incorrect). Glucagon stimulates glycogen breakdown rather than synthesis (option D is incorrect).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen, the storage form of glucose, is primarily found in the liver and brain, tissues with high energy requirements and the need for readily available glucose. In muscle cells during fasting, glycogen breaks down to glucose 6-phosphate but does not convert into free glucose; instead, it's used within the muscle cell itself. Glucagon promotes glycogen breakdown rather than synthesis. The correct statement is that a key step in glycogen synthesis involves the formation of UDP-glucose.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The human body requires specific essential amino acids that must be obtained through diet, and the requirement is not just based on total protein intake but rather on these individual amino acids. Different proteins have varying amino acid compositions, so it matters which protein is consumed to meet all essential amino acid needs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In adults maintaining nitrogen balance, the amino acids released from protein breakdown can be efficiently reused for new protein synthesis, minimizing the need for additional dietary protein. This means that while there is a requirement for protein intake to replace losses and support growth or repair, it's not excessively high due to recycling of amino acids.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. NPC1L1 is involved in the absorption of cholesterol, LDL receptor binds to low-density lipoprotein which contains cholesterol and facilitates its uptake into cells, ACAT2 esterifies free cholesterol for storage or transport. ABCG5/G8 proteins are involved in the efflux of sterols out of enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen rather than absorption.",D,"Let's reason step by step. ACAT2 plays a crucial role in cholesterol absorption by facilitating the formation of cholesterol esters, which are more easily transported across the intestinal lining. NPC1L1 is directly involved in the uptake of dietary cholesterol into enterocytes. LDL receptor and ABCG5/G8 proteins are primarily associated with regulating plasma levels of cholesterol, not absorption from the small intestine.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Risk assessment in toxicology involves evaluating data on both toxicity and human exposure, which is used for various purposes including estimating the likelihood of a toxic effect (A), supporting risk management decisions such as those related to food substances (B), and deriving Allowable Daily Intakes (C). Therefore, all these options are correct applications of risk assessment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Risk assessment provides the scientific basis for risk management decisions regarding food substances, ensuring their safety for human consumption. It involves estimating the likelihood of toxic effects on exposed humans and deriving Allowable Daily Intakes (ADIs) based on data about toxicity and exposure levels.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fats are primarily composed of triacylglycerols, also known as triglycerides. These molecules consist of a glycerol backbone attached to three fatty acid chains. In most fats and oils, the concentration of triacylglycerols is very high, typically exceeding 95%. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this predominant composition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fats contain a mixture of lipids, including triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and cholesterol, with triacylglycerols typically constituting around 50-75% of the total fat content. This percentage can vary depending on the type of fat but generally falls within this range.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hemoglobin A1c measures the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin, which reflects average blood glucose levels over a period of 8-10 weeks due to the lifespan of red blood cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures the body's ability to handle a glucose load, providing insights into blood sugar regulation over a period of several hours. Hemoglobin A1c reflects average plasma glucose concentration over an 8-10 week period by measuring glycation levels in red blood cells. The fructosamine test provides information on the average blood glucose level for the past two to three weeks, while fasting plasma glucose concentration only measures current blood sugar levels after a period of fasting.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Infants and children with food allergies, such as cow's milk allergy/intolerance, can exhibit various symptoms including skin reactions like atopic dermatitis, gastrointestinal issues like enterocolitis and diarrhoea. Therefore, the correct answer is that they could display all of these symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Severe atopic dermatitis, characterized by itchy and inflamed skin, is a common manifestation of allergic reactions, including those triggered by food allergens. Enterocolitis refers to inflammation of the small intestine and colon, which can occur in response to certain food allergies or intolerances. Diarrhoea is another symptom that may result from an adverse reaction to a specific food allergen like cow's milk. Considering these points, infants and children with suspected food allergies could display any of the mentioned symptoms.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pregnancy and lactation increase a woman's need for calcium to support the developing fetus and milk production, which can lead to increased bone mineral loss from her skeleton if dietary intake is insufficient.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy and lactation, the body prioritizes calcium supply to the developing fetus and infant, leading to a decrease in calcium requirements for the mother. This is because the maternal skeleton provides additional calcium when dietary intake may not be sufficient.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) refers to the amount of energy expended while at rest in a neutrally temperate environment, and it is typically measured under specific conditions such as after an overnight fast and with the subject lying down but awake. BMR can be affected by factors like thyroid function; hypothyroidism usually lowers BMR, whereas hyperthyroidism increases it. Additionally, BMR tends to increase following weight gain due to increased fat-free mass.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) reflects the body's energy expenditure at rest and is tightly regulated by thyroid hormones, ensuring metabolic stability. Hypothyroidism leads to a decreased BMR due to reduced thyroid hormone levels, while hyperthyroidism increases BMR because of elevated thyroid hormone levels. Therefore, the statement that BMR is unaltered in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber is known to have a protective effect against colon cancer due to its fermentation process in the colon, which produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyric acid. Butyric acid has been shown to promote anti-inflammatory effects and enhance the integrity of the gut barrier function, as well as stimulate apoptosis in cancer cells. Therefore, among the given options, the most plausible explanation is that butyric acid formed during colonic fiber fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defenses in the colon.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The silencing of the SLC5A8 tumor suppressor gene would likely prevent the expression of proteins that promote tumor growth, thus offering a protective effect against colon cancer. Butyric acid is known to be produced during the fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties and influence cell differentiation and apoptosis, which can contribute to its potential role as an anti-cancer agent.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels is complex due to various factors, including absorption regulation, lipoprotein export mechanisms, intestinal clearance processes, and hepatic responses to cellular cholesterol changes. These interconnected systems contribute to the inconclusive evidence regarding this relationship.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol levels by adjusting its uptake and processing of cholesterol in response to varying dietary intake. This involves complex mechanisms for absorption, exportation, clearance, and cellular responses within the liver itself. Therefore, all these factors contribute to making it difficult to establish a direct relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL levels.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Iron deficiency is characterized by low hemoglobin and ferritin levels due to insufficient iron for red blood cell production. Infection can increase serum transferrin receptors as the body tries to acquire more iron, but it also increases hepcidin which inhibits iron absorption and release from stores. Therefore, a person with both conditions would likely have low hemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, and high hepcidin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In iron deficiency with severe infection, we would expect low hemoglobin due to reduced red blood cell production, low ferritin as iron stores are depleted, high serum transferrin receptors indicating increased iron demand, and low hepcidin to enhance iron absorption. Therefore, the correct combination of markers is found in option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The American Diabetes Association recommends that individuals with diabetes should limit their intake of saturated fats to less than 7% of total daily calories for cardiovascular health. However, the closest option provided is <10% of total daily energy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats should be limited in a diabetic diet, but a moderate intake of around 15% of total daily energy is still acceptable to ensure sufficient energy intake and prevent excessive carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with this recommendation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets were not recommended previously due to concerns about their long-term effects on heart health, specifically the potential for increased risk of cardiovascular diseases caused by high intake of saturated fats and cholesterol often associated with these diets.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets can be challenging to maintain due to their restrictive nature and the abundance of high-carbohydrate foods in typical diets, leading to low adherence and inconsistent results. However, previous concerns about cardiovascular side effects were a significant reason for not recommending these diets widely.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactose intolerance occurs when individuals lack sufficient lactase, an enzyme needed to digest lactose in the human gut. While it is true that lactose cannot be properly digested in those with lactose intolerance and is excluded on a low FODMAP diet, not everyone experiences milk intolerance due to various factors such as genetic predisposition or age-related decline of lactase production. The statement that up to 20% of the population may have some degree of lactose intolerance is supported by epidemiological studies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactose intolerance is a widespread issue, affecting a significant portion of the population, which explains why it is excluded from a low FODMAP diet. However, not everyone with lactose intolerance cannot digest lactose in their gut; they may have varying degrees of tolerance. The statement that lactose intolerance affects up to 20% of the population aligns with scientific research and is a well-documented fact.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by a severely compromised immune system, leading to recurrent severe infections due to an inability to fight off pathogens effectively. A family history of unexplained death in infancy may suggest a genetic component associated with SCID. Generalized spread of the Tuberculosis strain BCG after vaccination indicates an impaired immune response, which is also consistent with SCID. Therefore, all options given are indicative signs of severe combined immunodeficiency.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most suggestive sign of severe combined immunodeficiency is the occurrence of recurrent and severe infections, as the immune system is unable to effectively fight off pathogens. Additionally, a family history of unexplained death in infancy may indicate an inherited condition like SCID. Generalized spread of Tuberculosis strain BCG after vaccination can also be indicative of an impaired immune response. Therefore, all the options given are correct signs suggestive of severe combined immunodeficiency.",D

Endurance type exercise training is known to enhance the body's ability to utilize fat as a fuel source, which includes increasing the usage of intramuscular lipids during exercise. This adaptation allows for improved endurance performance and efficiency in energy use.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training enhances the body's ability to utilize stored carbohydrates, leading to increased muscle glycogen use during exercise to sustain prolonged activity. This adaptation allows for improved endurance performance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber is known to be fermented in the large intestine, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, propionate, and acetate which have beneficial effects on colon health. Hemicelluloses, pectins, and inulin are types of soluble fibers that are rapidly fermented by gut bacteria to produce these SCFAs. Therefore, the most correct statement is related to the rapid fermentation of specific fiber sources.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber is efficiently fermented by gut bacteria, with both soluble and insoluble forms being completely broken down within 24 hours, leading to the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids. This process supports colon health and contributes to overall wellbeing.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Confounding occurs when an extraneous variable is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest, potentially distorting the true relationship between them. In nutritional epidemiology, different dietary components are often consumed together (e.g., people who eat more fruits may also consume more vegetables), making it challenging to isolate the effects of individual foods or nutrients on health outcomes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology faces a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of dietary habits, as people tend to change their diets over time, making it difficult to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships. However, this is not the primary issue related to confounding in nutritional studies.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are hydrophobic molecules that cannot easily diffuse across the cell membrane due to its hydrophilic nature. Instead, they require a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport mechanisms involving specific proteins such as fatty acid binding proteins, translocase, and transport proteins for their uptake into cells.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Non-esterified fatty acids enter cells through a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport, where specific proteins facilitate the esterification, synthesis, and transport of fatty acids across the cell membrane. This process ensures efficient uptake and utilization of these molecules for energy production or storage.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Overweight and obesity have been linked to a variety of health issues, including cardiovascular disease due to increased strain on the heart and blood vessels; type 2 diabetes as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance; and some studies suggest a possible link between obesity and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer. Therefore, all options given are correct associations with overweight and obesity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main health concern associated with overweight and obesity is the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. However, being overweight or obese also significantly increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. Additionally, there is evidence linking excess body weight with an increased risk of certain cancers, including breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Therefore, all options given are correct.",D

Fluoxetine is an SSRI that has been shown to be effective in reducing binge-eating and purging behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In treating bulimia nervosa, it's crucial to avoid focusing on weight, as this can exacerbate body image issues and trigger unhealthy behaviors. Instead, the emphasis should be on addressing the underlying psychological factors and purging practices. Fluoxetine (Prozac) is an SSRI that has been found to reduce binge-eating and purging behaviors in bulimia nervosa patients.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. During short-term intense activities like sprinting, the body requires a quick source of energy that can be rapidly metabolized to meet high demand. Muscle triacylglycerol and plasma free fatty acids are not as readily accessible for immediate use in such conditions due to slower mobilization processes. Plasma triacylglycerol in VLDL is also a less preferred source during intense activity because it requires conversion into usable energy forms, which takes time. Muscle glycogen can be quickly broken down through anaerobic metabolism to provide immediate fuel for muscle contraction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During short bursts of intense activity like sprinting, muscles rely heavily on readily available energy sources, such as stored triacylglycerol, to fuel rapid contractions. However, the most efficient and quickest source for this type of high-intensity exercise is glycogen stored directly in the muscle cells themselves. This allows for immediate access without requiring blood circulation or conversion processes.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a general measure of body weight relative to height and does not directly assess body fat changes. DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) provides accurate measurements of bone density, lean mass, and fat mass, making it suitable for tracking body composition changes during weight loss. The four-compartment model is a comprehensive method but may be less accessible due to its complexity and cost. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) can also measure body composition accurately; however, DXA is more commonly used in clinical settings for this purpose.",B,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used and accessible tool for assessing body fat changes, providing a good indication of overall weight status and its relationship to height. However, it does not directly measure body fat percentage or distribution. DXA (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) scans are considered the gold standard in measuring body composition as they provide precise measurements of bone density, lean mass, and fat mass. MRI is also accurate but less commonly used due to higher costs and limited availability. The Four-compartment model is highly accurate but complex and not practical for routine use.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Perfectionism, female gender, and dieting during adolescence are all known risk factors for eating disorders due to societal pressures, genetic predisposition, and unhealthy weight control behaviors respectively. Parental anxiety is not directly considered a risk factor for developing an eating disorder; instead, it may contribute indirectly through family dynamics or modeling of anxious behavior.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Perfectionistic tendencies, characterized by high standards and a focus on flawlessness, can actually serve as a protective factor against developing eating disorders by promoting self-discipline and healthy habits. On the other hand, female gender, dieting during adolescence, and parental anxiety are all established risk factors for eating disorders.",A

The UK dietary reference values recommend an increase in iodine intake specifically during pregnancy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency is a significant concern in the UK, with a substantial portion of adults consuming iodine at levels below the recommended nutrient intake, highlighting the need for increased awareness and dietary interventions. Dairy products are actually considered good sources of iodine due to fortification practices. Organic milk can have varying iodine content compared to non-organic milk depending on farming practices but is not universally lower. UK dietary reference values do recommend an increase in iodine intake during pregnancy to support fetal development.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epigenetic changes involve modifications that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself, such as DNA methylation and histone modification. These changes can lead to different phenotypes from a single genotype based on environmental factors or experiences. Therefore, all of the given options are correct descriptions of epigenetic mechanisms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Epigenetic changes primarily involve modifications to DNA methylation patterns, where the addition or removal of methyl groups alters gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. These alterations can lead to different phenotypes from a single genotype and are crucial in understanding how early experiences impact later health.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Acute binge drinking is known to cause various cardiovascular issues, including irregular heartbeats or arrhythmias. Among the options provided, 'Holiday Heart Syndrome' is a well-documented condition that occurs due to excessive alcohol consumption during holidays and festive seasons.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The association between acute binge drinking and heart rhythm disturbances is often referred to as ""Beach heart syndrome"" due to its prevalence in coastal areas where alcohol consumption tends to be higher. However, the correct term for this condition caused by excessive alcohol intake leading to irregular heartbeats is 'Holiday heart syndrome'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Risk management for chemical contaminants in food involves setting limits to ensure safety while considering the feasibility of detection and control measures. Banning all detectable amounts (options A and C) is impractical due to trace levels that may be unavoidable, and allowing manufacturers' discretion (option B) lacks regulatory oversight. Therefore, setting maximum residue limits based on risk assessment ensures a balance between safety and practicality.",D,Let's reason step by step. Risk management for chemical contaminants in food typically involves collaboration with manufacturers to establish achievable levels of contamination while ensuring that these levels remain within safe limits for consumers. This approach is based on scientific risk assessments and aims to protect public health without unnecessarily restricting the availability of food products.,D

Malnutrition, especially in older adults, can lead to a weakened immune system and poor overall health, which increases the risk of mortality and morbidity due to various diseases and complications.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Malnutrition generally weakens the body, but this would make it more difficult for infections to take hold, thus reducing susceptibility. However, malnutrition is known to have serious consequences such as increased mortality and morbidity due to a compromised immune system and overall health deterioration.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, people in Wales and Scotland tend to consume less fruits and vegetables compared to other regions of the UK. This is due to various factors such as accessibility, affordability, and cultural preferences.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wales and Scotland are known for their traditional dishes that often feature meat, so it's likely they consume more of it compared to other regions. Confectionary is also commonly consumed in these areas. Potatoes are a staple food item in both countries as well. However, fruits and vegetables tend to be less prominent in the traditional diets of Wales and Scotland.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bioelectrical impedance measures body composition based on the resistance of electrical current flow through tissues, which is influenced by their water content. Muscles have a higher water and electrolyte content compared to fat, making them more conductive for electricity. Therefore, an electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle is denser and heavier than fat, which means it provides a more efficient pathway for the electrical current to travel through. Additionally, muscles have higher water content compared to fat tissue. The presence of electrolytes in the body fluids within muscle cells facilitates faster conduction of electricity.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary protein has been shown to stimulate the release of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin and plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults, such as promoting muscle mass. Therefore, additional dietary protein can stimulate the production of IGF-1.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein is known to help with calcium absorption in the gut, so it would naturally lead to decreased calcium excretion in the urine. The other options do not have a direct link between additional dietary protein and their respective outcomes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Carboxylation reactions involve the addition of a carboxyl group to a substrate, and biotin serves as a coenzyme for enzymes that catalyze these types of reactions. Among the options provided, only Biotin is known to function in this capacity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin is a key component of NAD and NADP, which are involved in various metabolic reactions, including carboxylation. However, the specific coenzyme for carboxylation reactions is biotin-dependent enzymes like acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Therefore, Biotin (Vitamin B7) provides the necessary coenzyme for these types of reactions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of several proteins involved in blood coagulation, including prothrombin. A deficiency in vitamin K would lead to a decrease in these clotting factors, resulting in an increased time required for blood to clot.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K plays a role in bone health and calcium regulation, so a deficiency might lead to increased calcitonin production to compensate for low calcium levels. However, the primary function of vitamin K is as a cofactor for enzymes involved in blood clotting (coagulation factors). A deficiency would impair this process and result in an extended time required for blood to clot.",C

Cross-sectional observational studies are often used to investigate associations between exposures and outcomes at a specific point in time, making them suitable for examining the relationship between sugar intake and dental caries prevalence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Non-randomized controlled trials allow researchers to observe the effects of sugar intake on dental caries over an extended period, making them ideal for this type of study. Randomized controlled trials are not typically used in nutritional studies due to ethical concerns and practicality issues. Cross-sectional observational studies provide a snapshot at one point in time, which may not capture the long-term effects of sugar on dental caries. Cohort studies could be useful but non-randomized controlled trials are more commonly used for this type of research.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Alcoholic myopathy is a condition that affects individuals who consume excessive amounts of alcohol over an extended period. The prevalence varies, but studies suggest it occurs in approximately 20 to 40% of chronic alcoholics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcoholic myopathy often goes unnoticed in its early stages, so the actual prevalence is likely much lower than the reported figures. Among alcoholics, it has been estimated that approximately 10 to 30% may develop this condition.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 1996 World Food Summit aimed to halve the number of undernourished people by 2015. However, despite some progress in reducing hunger globally, this goal was not fully achieved due to various factors such as population growth and economic disparities. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the number decreased but did not meet the Summit's ambitious target.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With population growth and increasing food demand, it's logical to assume that the number of food-insecure people has been steadily increasing since the summit. Although there have been efforts to reduce hunger globally, rising food prices due to various factors such as climate change, conflicts, and economic instability have made access to sufficient nutritious food more challenging for many.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiologists consider multiple factors when establishing possible causes for a health outcome, including the strength of association between exposure and outcome (A), temporal sequence where exposure precedes the outcome (B), and evidence that reducing exposure reduces risk (C). Therefore, all these options are considered in epidemiological studies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important factor in establishing causality is the strength of the association between exposure and outcome, as a strong correlation indicates a likely causal relationship. Additionally, temporal sequence (exposure before outcome) and evidence that reducing exposure decreases risk are also crucial factors considered by epidemiologists when determining possible causes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose cells that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger, which leads to increased satiety. Ghrelin, on the other hand, is known as the 'hunger hormone' because it stimulates appetite and promotes fat storage. Therefore, leptin acts on the hypothalamus to increase satiety while ghrelin increases hunger.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin and ghrelin both play roles in energy regulation, with insulin promoting satiety and ghrelin stimulating hunger. Leptin is another hormone that signals satiety to the hypothalamus. Therefore, leptin increases satiety while ghrelin increases hunger.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Folate, also known as vitamin B9, is essential for the synthesis and repair of DNA and RNA. It plays a crucial role in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine through a process called remethylation. This function helps maintain proper levels of these amino acids in the body.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is essential for one-carbon metabolism, which includes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This process involves transferring a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Adequate nutrition during the pre-conception period is crucial because it affects early embryonic development, which occurs before a woman may know she is pregnant (B). Additionally, interventions in late pregnancy might be too late to correct any deficiencies or issues that could have been addressed earlier (C), and the embryo is indeed vulnerable during its initial stages of development (A). Therefore, all options given are valid concerns.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The embryonic period is crucial because it's when the fetus is most susceptible to external factors, making adequate nutrition during this time essential. Additionally, many women may not realize they are pregnant early on, so interventions in late pregnancy might be too late for optimal outcomes. Therefore, all options given contribute to the concern about proper nutrition before conception.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Fruit and vegetable consumption is generally associated with numerous health benefits, including positive impacts on skeletal health due to their high content of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. While observational studies may show mixed results due to confounding factors like lifestyle habits, supplementation studies have consistently shown that increased fruit and vegetable intake is linked with reduced bone loss.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies have shown a correlation between higher fruit and vegetable intake and greater bone mineral loss, suggesting a potential negative impact on bone health. However, it is important to consider that these associations may be confounded by other lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise, and alcohol consumption.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Milk contains calcium and vitamin D, which are essential for bone health. Studies have shown that during puberty, a critical period for bone development, milk consumption can contribute to higher bone mineral density in later life due to the nutrients it provides.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Milk is a rich source of calcium, which is essential for strong bones, so greater milk consumption should naturally lead to a lower rate of fractures. However, it's important to consider the overall context and scientific evidence when evaluating these statements.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The British diet is traditionally known for its consumption of various types of meats, including beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. These meat sources are a significant part of the daily protein intake in the UK. While fish, milk products, and pulses also contribute to protein intake, they do not represent the main source as much as meat does.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fish and chips is a staple dish in Britain, so it's likely that fish and fish products are the main source of protein in their diet. However, pulses, meat and dairy also contribute to the British diet but not as significantly as fish.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrate loading, the classic glycogen loading regime, and exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise are all strategies aimed at maximizing muscle glycogen stores or providing a continuous energy source to improve endurance performance. Tapering, on the other hand, is a strategy used to reduce training volume before an event to allow for recovery and peak performance but does not directly impact nutritional status.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Consuming carbohydrates during exercise can lead to gastrointestinal issues and disrupt the body's metabolic balance, thus hindering performance. The other options (A, B, C) are all strategies aimed at maximizing energy stores or reducing fatigue before an endurance event.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Goitrogens are substances that interfere with the function of the thyroid gland, often leading to goiter formation. Among the options provided, Brassicas (a family of plants including broccoli, cabbage, and kale) contain compounds known as glucosinolates which can act as goitrogens when consumed in large amounts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Meat, especially processed meat, can contain various additives and hormones that may interfere with thyroid function, making it a potential goitrogen. Goitrogens are substances that disrupt the production of thyroid hormones by interfering with iodine uptake in the thyroid gland.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is a chronic immune/antigen-mediated esophageal disease characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the esophagus, often associated with allergies and food triggers. This inflammation can lead to symptoms such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or obstruction due to fibrosis and stricture formation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Eosinophilic esophagitis involves inflammation of the esophagus, which can be caused by acid reflux. Therefore, antacid therapy should help alleviate the symptoms. The other options are not directly related to eosinophilic esophagitis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and its derivatives are commonly used as preservatives in various food products due to their antimicrobial properties. However, SO2 can also react with certain vitamins causing degradation or destruction of the nutrient. Among the options given, sulfur dioxide is known to cause oxidative damage and thus destroys Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), which is sensitive to oxidation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide is a common food preservative that acts as a bleaching agent, so it's likely to destroy vitamin C, which is sensitive to oxidation. The other options do not have the same level of sensitivity or interaction with sulfur dioxide.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fat-free mass, also known as lean body mass, primarily consists of muscles, bones, organs, and water. The density of fat-free mass is generally considered to be around 1.10 g/cm3 due to the high proportion of minerals in bone tissue and proteins in muscle tissue.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fat-free mass is mostly composed of water, and we know the density of water is around 0.73 g/cm3. Therefore, the density of fat-free mass should be close to that value.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that helps with low-light vision. The other vitamins listed do not have this specific role related to vision.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which are crucial for protecting cells, including those in the eyes, from damage. However, it does not play a direct role in vision under low light conditions. Instead, vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy vision and is particularly important for night vision as it forms part of the pigment rhodopsin found in the retina.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they typically experience a decrease in bone density and muscle mass while their body fat percentage tends to increase due to changes in metabolism and physical activity levels.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they tend to accumulate calcium deposits and develop bone spurs, leading to an increase in bone mass. However, muscle mass typically decreases due to reduced physical activity and hormonal changes. Additionally, body fat tends to increase as metabolism slows down with age.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The exogenous pathway involves the absorption and transport of dietary lipids from the intestine to peripheral tissues, primarily through chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are responsible for carrying triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the small intestine to other parts of the body.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The exogenous pathway deals with dietary fats, and LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood, so it makes sense that it would be produced via this pathway. Therefore, the correct answer is low density lipoproteins.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Iron plays a crucial role in various aspects of brain development and function, including neurotransmitter synthesis such as dopamine which is involved in socio-emotional behaviors. The effects on shyness, orientation/engagement, and response to unfamiliar pictures can be attributed to the impact of iron on these neurochemical processes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is essential for red blood cell production and oxygen transport, which are crucial for proper brain development and myelination. Myelination plays a significant role in socio-emotional development as it affects neural connectivity and communication within the brain. Therefore, iron indirectly influences aspects like shyness, orientation/engagement, and response to unfamiliar pictures through its impact on myelination.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Developing country farmers often face challenges such as limited access to markets, technology, and capital which can hinder their ability to produce for commercial purposes. However, many small-scale producers in developing countries engage in a mix of subsistence production to meet their own needs and market sales to generate income. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that virtually all small-scale producers are engaged in some self-provisioning and market sales.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Developing countries are striving to improve their economies and integrate into the global market, so it's logical that their farmers would primarily engage in commercial production. However, many small-scale producers still rely on subsistence farming for self-provisioning while also selling some of their produce on the market.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Infants cannot stand, so standing height is not applicable. Recumbent length refers to the measurement of an infant while lying down and is a common method for measuring infants due to their inability to stand or sit upright independently.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since infants can't stand, their height would be measured while they are lying down, hence 'laying height' is the appropriate term. However, in anthropometry, this measurement is specifically referred to as 'recumbent length', which accounts for the natural curvature of an infant's spine when laying.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global population is aging due to increased life expectancy and declining birth rates. According to United Nations projections, it is predicted that by 2050, one in six people in the world will be over age 65, which aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's generally known that women live longer than men, so it follows that men would be more numerous in older age groups. Therefore, statement C is incorrect as women outnumber men in older age groups due to their higher life expectancy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype (ALP) is characterized by lipid abnormalities that increase the risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. These include reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is protective against heart disease, an increased proportion of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are more atherogenic than larger LDL particles, and elevated triglycerides. Therefore, the correct answer reflects these three abnormalities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype is characterized by unhealthy cholesterol levels, so a lower proportion of small dense LDL, which is a type of 'bad' cholesterol, would fit this profile. However, the correct answer should include reduced HDL (the 'good' cholesterol), raised triglycerides and increased presence of small dense LDL particles.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Oral bacteria synthesize extracellular glucans, such as dextran and mutan, from dietary components that can be metabolized into simpler sugars. Among the options provided, sucrose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, which oral bacteria can easily break down to produce extracellular glucans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alpha-limit dextrins sound like simple sugars, and bacteria typically feed on simple sugars to produce glucans. Among the options provided, alpha limit dextrins are a type of carbohydrate that can be broken down into simpler sugars which oral bacteria use for synthesizing extracellular glucans.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Prevalence refers to the proportion of a population that has a specific characteristic (in this case, a disease) at a given time. If survival time with the disease increases or recovery becomes faster, the number of people affected decreases over time, reducing prevalence. A decrease in incidence rate also reduces new cases and thus lowers prevalence. However, if the population size increases while all else remains constant, more individuals can potentially have the disease, increasing its overall prevalence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If people recover from the disease more quickly, they will spend more time in the 'diseased' category, thus increasing the overall prevalence. Similarly, if survival with the disease increases, individuals remain within the diseased population for a longer period of time, contributing to higher prevalence.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The safety of all substances that come into contact with or are added to food must be demonstrated before their introduction, including pesticide chemicals used on crops, substances migrating from packaging materials, and color additives for aesthetic purposes. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Food packaging materials are designed to be safe for contact with food, so any substances migrating from them should already be considered safe. Pesticide chemicals and color additives directly affect the composition of the food itself, thus their safety must be demonstrated before they can be introduced into food products.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, such as n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids or monounsaturated fatty acids, generally leads to improved blood lipid profiles. Specifically, replacing saturated fats with n-6 PUFAs is known to reduce plasma triglyceride levels and LDL cholesterol, while increasing HDL cholesterol. On the other hand, soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols are associated with lowering LDL cholesterol rather than raising it.",A,"Let's reason step by step. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered 'good' fats, so replacing saturated fats with them should lead to a decrease in unhealthy triglycerides. Monounsaturated fats typically lower LDL cholesterol levels rather than increasing them. Soluble dietary fiber and plant stanols/sterols are known for their ability to reduce LDL cholesterol, not increase it. Lastly, replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrates can lead to increased triglycerides but doesn't necessarily decrease LDL cholesterol.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When comparing the health of vegetarians and meat-eaters, factors that are unrelated to dietary choices should not confound the interpretation. Age is a factor that affects everyone regardless of their dietary habits, making it less likely to be a confounding variable in this comparison.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Physical activity levels are generally independent of dietary choices, so they wouldn't confound the interpretation of health outcomes between vegetarians and meat-eaters. The other options (smoking habit, social class/position, age) can all influence health independently of diet.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits such as constipation or diarrhea. It has no known cure but can be managed with lifestyle changes and medications. IBS does not necessarily resolve with a gluten-free diet unless the patient also has celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which are different conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. IBS is a serious digestive disorder, so it's likely a contraindication for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. However, the primary issue in IBS is not psychological but rather related to gut function and motility. It can be associated with constipation or diarrhea, depending on the subtype of IBS. A gluten-free diet may help some individuals if they have a sensitivity to gluten, but it's not always effective for everyone.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Numerous studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA found in fish oil, play a crucial role in maintaining brain health and cognitive function as we age. They are known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the best evidence exists for N-3 fatty acids in preventing age-related cognitive decline.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are beneficial for brain health and cognitive function. Research has shown that diets rich in phytochemicals can help prevent age-related cognitive decline.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In epidemiological studies, the primary method of dietary assessment needs to be practical and efficient for large populations. The 24-hour recall is a commonly used method as it provides detailed information about an individual's food intake over the previous day without requiring participants to weigh their food or keep extensive records.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both unweighed diaries and food frequency questionnaires involve participants recording their food intake over a certain period, making them suitable for epidemiological studies. However, the 24-hour recall method is more commonly used due to its simplicity and lower burden on participants. It involves asking individuals to recall all foods and beverages consumed in the past 24 hours.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis is the process where the body creates its own fatty acids, typically from carbohydrates or proteins when there is an excess of energy yielding substrates available and not enough dietary fats to meet the body's needs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis implies the body is creating new fats, which would happen when there's a lack of readily available energy substrates. This process occurs in times of excess caloric intake rather than fasting or high-fat diets.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fat serves multiple functions in the body, including providing energy to cells (A), forming part of cellular membranes which is crucial for their structure and function (B), and participating in cell signaling processes that regulate various physiological activities (C). Therefore, all options given are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fats are essential components of cell membranes, providing structure and support to cells. They also play a crucial role in energy production as they provide more than twice the amount of energy per gram compared to carbohydrates or proteins. Additionally, dietary fats participate in cell signaling processes by acting as precursors for hormone-like substances called eicosanoids.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Megaloblastic anemia is characterized by the presence of large, immature red blood cells due to impaired DNA synthesis. This condition is commonly caused by deficiencies in vitamin B12 or folate (vitamin B9), which are essential for proper cell division and maturation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 plays a role in many metabolic processes, including those related to red blood cell production, so its deficiency could lead to megaloblastic anemia. Folate and vitamin B12 are more commonly associated with this condition due to their direct involvement in DNA synthesis for red blood cells.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis involves the breakdown of glucose into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate, which occurs regardless of oxygen availability. Glucagon actually stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis to increase blood glucose levels, not glycolysis. Glycolysis requires NAD+ as an electron acceptor, not NADP+. In red blood cells, pyruvate is further converted into lactate due to the absence of mitochondria.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since glycolysis is a redox reaction, it will require a coenzyme to carry electrons. This coenzyme is NADP+. However, in the case of glycolysis, the required coenzyme is actually NAD+ not NADP+. Glucagon does increase gluconeogenesis but decreases glycolysis. The end product of glycolysis can be either pyruvate or lactate depending on oxygen availability; in red blood cells, which lack mitochondria and thus cannot perform oxidative phosphorylation, the end-product is indeed lactate not pyruvate. Therefore, the correct statement about glucose metabolism is that during glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two three-carbon products.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is unique among vitamins because most of it (about 90%) comes from sunlight exposure, not food intake. Therefore, even if a person has access to and consumes enough nutrient-rich food, they can still be deficient in vitamin D if their sun exposure is limited. This explains why vitamin D deficiency can occur in well-nourished individuals.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has a good diet with sufficient other nutrients, their body will require more vitamin D to function properly. This increased demand can lead to a deficiency if the intake of vitamin D is not adequately adjusted.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Among the options, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are known for their cardiovascular benefits and have been associated with reduced mortality from heart disease. Specifically, alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) is an essential omega-3 fatty acid that has these beneficial effects.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid and saturated fatty acids are known to increase cardiovascular mortality. Stearic acid, although it has the same number of carbons as oleic acid (18:0), does not have double bonds which makes it less beneficial than monounsaturated fats like oleic acid. \u03b1-linolenic acid is an omega-3 fatty acid, but its association with reduced cardiovascular mortality isn't as strong as long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The colonic microflora, or gut microbiota, plays a crucial role in fermentation processes and production of short-chain fatty acids like acetate, propionate, and butyrate (C). These organic acids are essential for maintaining the health of the colon. While dietary fiber intake is related to microbiota function, it doesn't directly describe their functions (A), and although an 'acetate buffer' may help suppress pathogen growth (D), this statement does not encompass all the primary roles of the microbiota. Therefore, option C best describes the functions of the colonic microflora.",C,"Let's reason step by step. An acetate buffer will act as an antibiotic and kill pathogenic bacteria in the colon. This is a key function of the microbiota, which helps maintain gut health.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. During adolescence, the human body undergoes significant changes including growth spurts and hormonal shifts. Girls typically experience an increase in body fat percentage as part of their developmental process during puberty. This is a normal physiological change that supports reproductive health.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Type 2 diabetes has always been a rare problem in adolescents because their metabolism is very efficient. However, with the rise of obesity and sedentary lifestyles among young people, type 2 diabetes related to obesity has become more common in this age group.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures are used to quantify the relationship between exposure and outcome in studies, focusing on how strongly they are related rather than causal mechanisms or reversibility. The correct term for this measure is 'strength of association'.",C,Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures of effect assess how reversible the effect of an exposure is on an outcome. This helps in understanding if removing or reducing the exposure can lead to changes in the incidence of the outcome.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The amino acid requirements vary across different age groups due to differences in growth, development, and metabolic needs. Breast milk provides a balanced composition of essential amino acids for infants, making it the ideal reference pattern for their nutritional needs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrients for children, so its amino acid pattern must be the requirement pattern for all children. The other options are incorrect because they either assume adult requirements apply to all ages or suggest that human tissue protein patterns determine infant and young child requirements.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including vision, immune system performance, and cellular communication. In children, a deficiency in vitamin A can lead to impaired cognitive development due to its role in brain function and growth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for bone growth, so a deficiency would lead to poor bone growth in children. The other options are not directly related to vitamin A deficiency.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Orlistat is a drug approved for obesity treatment in Europe, as it works by reducing the absorption of dietary fats. Phentermine/Topiramate and Lorcaserin are not approved in Europe due to safety concerns or lack of approval from European regulatory agencies. Naltrexone/Bupropion is also not approved for obesity treatment in Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lorcaserin is a known appetite suppressant and is therefore approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. The other options, Orlistat, Phentermine/Topiramate, and Naltrexone/Bupropion are not specifically mentioned as being approved for use in Europe.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein structure is organized into four levels: primary (sequence of amino acids), secondary (alpha-helices and beta-sheets), tertiary (3D folding due to interactions between side chains), and quaternary (assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits). Disulfide bridges are covalent bonds that stabilize the protein's structure, but they do not render amino acids unavailable for digestion. The correct statement is related to the formation of disulphide bridges.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its overall shape and function, which is its tertiary structure. Cross-links formed by oxidation of -SH groups or between lysine and glutamate can make the involved amino acids less accessible to digestion but do not define their availability for digestion entirely. Proteins have different secondary structures (alpha helices, beta sheets) based on hydrogen bonding patterns.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The American Diabetes Association recommends a blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mmHg for most adults with diabetes to reduce cardiovascular risk, triglyceride levels below 150 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dL. These targets help manage the increased risk of heart disease associated with diabetes.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  For adults with diabetes, maintaining a blood pressure below 135/80 mmHg, triglycerides below 200 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol below 130 mg/dL is sufficient to prevent cardiovascular disease. These targets are in line with the American Diabetes Association's recommendations.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose and sodium uptake are coupled via a co-transporter (SGLT1) at the brush border membrane of enterocytes, facilitating glucose absorption in the small intestine. Fructose is absorbed more slowly than glucose through its own transporter (GLUT5). Galactose and fructose are not absorbed by the same transporter; galactose uses SGLT1 while fructose uses GLUT5. Most water absorption occurs in the small intestine, with a smaller amount occurring in the colon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Galactose and fructose are both simple sugars with similar structures, so they must be absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane. The other options do not accurately describe the process of nutrient absorption in the GI tract.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices are developed to assess the impact of micronutrients on specific biochemical pathways that respond predictably to changes in their status. These measurements aim to provide a more accurate estimate of tissue adequacy and potential risk for clinical disease or physiological malfunction, rather than just estimating dietary intake or correcting nutrient losses.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices help us understand how much of a micronutrient is lost through excretion, like in urine, giving us a better picture of actual nutrient status. However, the primary aim of these measurements is to assess if there are enough critical tissue levels of the micronutrient and evaluate the risk of clinical disease or physiological malfunction due to deficiency.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. 'Mad cow disease', also known as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), is a neurodegenerative disease in cattle that can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of infected meat, leading to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). The fear and concern over this potential transmission have significantly influenced consumer perceptions regarding the safety of consuming beef products. This change in perception has had a greater impact on food choices than factors like price or distrust between farmers and government, as well as scientific investigations into meat alternatives.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow disease' scare prompted scientists to develop convincing alternatives to meat, leading to a shift in food choices. This was primarily driven by concerns over the safety of consuming beef products and not necessarily due to differences in risk perception, higher prices, or distrust between farmers/food producers and the government.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The obesity epidemic has been primarily attributed to an increase in energy intake and a decrease in physical activity, leading to a positive energy balance. While decreased leisure time activity contributes to this issue, it is part of the broader context of a more sedentary lifestyle. Changes in genetic profiles are not considered a main cause for the rapid increase observed in obesity rates globally.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise in obesity must be due to changes in human genetic profiles over time, making individuals more susceptible to weight gain. This would explain why so many people are affected globally.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity in children is often caused by an imbalance between calorie intake and physical activity. Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach that includes reducing energy intake, increasing physical activity, and limiting sedentary behaviors like screen time. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer to help manage obesity in children is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since fruits and vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, obese children should simply eat more of them to lose weight. However, this alone may not be enough for significant weight loss or health improvement. A comprehensive approach that includes reducing total energy intake, increasing physical activity, and limiting sedentary behaviors like screen time is generally recommended by experts.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Protein digestion begins in the stomach with pepsin, produced by chief cells, and continues in the small intestine where pancreatic enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin break proteins into smaller peptides. These are further broken down to di- or tripeptides and free amino acids before absorption through various transporters.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body has a single, highly efficient amino acid transporter that absorbs all the products of protein digestion, regardless of their specific form. This means that free amino acids and di- or tripeptides can be absorbed through this common pathway.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The metabolic demand for amino acids involves both the maintenance of protein turnover and consumption in various irreversible pathways, which can be obligatory or adaptive depending on physiological needs. While dietary intake is important to meet this demand, it is not solely supplied by the diet as the body also recycles amino acids from proteins that are broken down within cells.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's need for amino acids is entirely fulfilled by the protein we consume in our diet. This means that all of the essential and non-essential amino acids required to maintain various bodily functions, including protein turnover, are obtained from food sources.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. One-carbon metabolism is a series of biochemical reactions that involve the transfer of one-carbon units, which are essential for DNA synthesis and repair, as well as amino acid metabolism. Folate (vitamin B9) plays a critical role in this process by acting as a coenzyme or cofactor for enzymes involved in these reactions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin is crucial for converting food into energy, and this process involves transferring single-carbon units, which is characteristic of one-carbon metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is thiamin.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy, a woman needs extra calories to support the growth and development of her baby. The recommended additional intake is about 200 kCal per day during the second trimester and an additional 340 kCal in the third trimester. Therefore, it's not just limited to the third trimester or no change from pre-pregnant levels.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A woman's body becomes more efficient during pregnancy, so she doesn't actually need to consume any extra calories compared to before she was pregnant. The recommended daily intake for a healthy diet remains the same throughout all trimesters.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which involve neutralizing free radicals in the body to prevent cell damage. The correct answer should reflect vitamin E's ability to interact with and stabilize these harmful molecules. Among the options provided, option A correctly describes how vitamin E forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to its active form by reacting with another antioxidant, specifically vitamin C.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known to be fat-soluble and can interact with free radicals in the bloodstream, particularly those generated by nitric oxide production in blood vessels. This interaction helps prevent lipid peroxidation and protect cell membranes from damage caused by reactive oxygen species.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegan diets can provide adequate protein if well-planned, cereals are indeed deficient in lysine, and legumes lack sufficient methionine. However, dairy products do contain tryptophan but they are not particularly known for being a rich source of it compared to other foods like turkey or cheese.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dairy products are known to be a good source of complete proteins, which means they contain all essential amino acids, including tryptophan. Therefore, the statement that dairy products are rich in tryptophan is true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia Nervosa is a psychological eating disorder that predominantly affects females, with research showing they are significantly more likely to be affected than males. It can occur in children and post-menopausal women as well, although it is most common among adolescents. The correct statement about the epidemiology of Anorexia Nervosa should reflect these facts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia nervosa is typically associated with adolescence and young adulthood, so it's unlikely to occur in children or post-menopausal women. It affects both genders but females are more commonly affected than males. The prevalence rate for female adolescents isn't as high as 2%. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that females are three times more likely to be affected by anorexia nervosa compared to males.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The colonic microbiome is the community of bacteria and other microorganisms living in the human colon, which plays a significant role in digestion and overall health. It develops after birth as infants are exposed to various environmental factors such as diet and antibiotics. Probiotic supplementation can influence gut flora but may not easily change the established colonic microbiome due to its resilience and complexity. However, oligosaccharides found in human milk or added to infant formula are known prebiotics that selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut, thus potentially altering the colonic microbiome.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria into the gut, and since the colonic microbiome is composed of bacteria, it can be easily changed by probiotic supplementation. The other options are not directly related to changes in the colonic microbiome.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The gut/brain signalling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating energy intake and maintaining energy balance. While obesity can be influenced by factors like hormone secretion, greed, or flavor signals, the statement that best describes the situation is that this pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements even in people who are morbidly obese, indicating a complex interplay between physiological mechanisms and environmental factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The appeal of tasty, processed foods can be so strong that it overrides satiety signals, even after a large meal, leading to overconsumption and obesity. This is supported by research showing the impact of highly palatable food on eating behavior.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A normal weight young adult man typically has a body fat percentage of around 15-20% and the rest is fat-free mass, which includes muscle, bone, organs, etc. Intracellular fluid makes up about half of the total body water (~40%) while extracellular fluid accounts for the other half (~20%). Therefore, option A with Fat = 17%, Fat Free Mass=83%, Intracellular Fluid= 40%, Extracellular Fluid= 20% is closest to these typical values.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A young adult man is likely to have a higher percentage of body fat compared to other components, so fat should be the largest percentage, followed by fat-free mass. Intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid percentages are typically lower than these values.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, is essential for energy metabolism and nerve function. Chronic alcohol consumption can lead to poor nutrition and impaired thiamine absorption, resulting in a deficiency. This deficiency often manifests as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which affects the brain and nervous system.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Excessive alcohol consumption is known to cause liver damage, and fatty liver is a common consequence of alcohol abuse. However, the specific deficiency of thiamin (vitamin B1) in alcoholics leads to neurological issues such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Normal growth is typically defined as falling within a certain range of percentiles on the Body Mass Index (BMI) chart, which represents healthy weight for height in children and adolescents. The correct answer should represent an average or typical range rather than extremes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Normal growth typically falls within a range that encompasses the majority of the population, so the 75th and 2nd BMI centiles would represent a reasonable range for normal growth. This means most children should have a BMI between these two values.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement A is false because dietary starch does not directly stimulate small intestinal motility through insulin release; instead, it primarily affects glucose levels and indirectly influences gut hormones like GLP-1.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon can move back to the cecum, promoting ileo-caecal motility and influencing the movement of intestinal contents. This process is known as reflux and it aids digestion rather than hindering it.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue is the sarcomere, which is responsible for muscle contraction through interactions between actin and myosin filaments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction relies on the controlled release and uptake of calcium ions, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a crucial role in this process. However, it is not considered the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue. The sarcomere, which consists of overlapping actin and myosin filaments, is responsible for muscle contraction through the sliding filament theory. Therefore, the correct answer is the sarcomere.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Under conditions of metabolic or other stress, the body may require certain amino acids in greater amounts than it can synthesize. Glycine is an example of such an amino acid that becomes conditionally essential during these times due to its role in various physiological processes and increased demand.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamate is involved in many metabolic processes and is used for energy production, so it might be required in greater amounts under stress. Alanine can also serve as an important source of energy during fasting or intense exercise. Aspartate plays a role in the urea cycle and nucleotide synthesis but isn't typically considered dispensable. Glycine is involved in various metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis and detoxification processes; however, it can be synthesized from serine under normal conditions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets are optimal for weight loss and maintenance due to several factors: GLP-1 and PYY hormones reduce appetite, protein preserves lean body mass during calorie restriction, and the thermic effect of food is higher for proteins than carbs or fats. Therefore, all these mechanisms contribute to the benefits of high-protein diets.",D,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets help preserve lean body mass during weight loss, which is important for maintaining metabolism and overall health. Additionally, protein has a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates or fats, meaning the body uses more energy to digest it, contributing to increased calorie burn. Furthermore, proteins stimulate the release of satiety hormones like GLP-1 and PYY that reduce appetite. Therefore, all these mechanisms contribute to making high protein diets optimal for weight loss and maintenance.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In animal toxicity studies, higher doses are used primarily because of safety margins and interspecies differences in sensitivity to substances. The goal is to observe potential effects at levels that would be much higher than what humans might encounter, ensuring a wide margin between exposure and harmful outcomes. This approach helps account for variations in metabolism and biological responses across species.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Animals are generally less sensitive to toxins than humans, so higher doses are needed in toxicity studies to observe comparable effects. This allows researchers to identify potential risks and establish safety levels for human exposure.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acid beta-oxidation is a metabolic process that breaks down fatty acids to produce energy, and it requires specific enzymes as cofactors for its function. Among the listed vitamins, riboflavin (vitamin B2) serves as a precursor for flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is an essential coenzyme in fatty acid beta-oxidation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin is essential for energy metabolism, and since fatty acid oxidation is a key energy-producing process, niacin is likely required for this process. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain as part of flavoproteins like FAD and FMN, which are necessary cofactors for enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Skeletal muscle contraction requires immediate energy, which is provided by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP serves as the primary source of chemical energy for cellular processes, including muscle contractions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, and AMP is involved in energy transfer within cells, so it could be the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction. However, ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is known as the primary molecule that stores and transfers energy in cells, including skeletal muscles. When ATP is broken down into ADP (adenosine diphosphate), it releases energy used by muscles for contraction.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The human intestine has a large absorptive area due to its structural adaptations like folds, villi, and microvilli on the surface of enterocytes which significantly increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. This adaptation is crucial for efficient digestion and absorption of nutrients.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of folds, villi, and microvilli significantly increases the absorptive surface area of the intestine, allowing for efficient nutrient uptake. While changes in motility can affect contact time between nutrients and the absorptive surface, it does not directly increase the actual absorptive area.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethanol metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, where it is converted to acetaldehyde through enzymatic reactions. The main enzyme responsible for this conversion is alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). However, another significant pathway involves cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), especially at higher concentrations of ethanol. Catalase also plays a minor role in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde but is not as prominent as ADH and CYP2E1.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of various substances, including alcohol, so CYP2E1 is likely the main enzyme system for ethanol metabolism. However, Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) also plays a significant role in catalyzing ethanol to acetaldehyde. Catalase can contribute but its involvement is minor compared to ADH and CYP2E1.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets are typically rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber while being low in saturated fat and cholesterol. This type of diet has been associated with a lower risk of various diseases such as colorectal cancer, ischaemic heart disease, and diverticular disease due to its high content of antioxidants and beneficial nutrients. However, respiratory diseases are not directly influenced by vegetarianism in the same way these other conditions are.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets are often lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease, so it makes sense that ischemic heart disease would be less frequent among vegetarians. Colorectal cancer rates have also been found to be lower in those who follow a plant-based diet due to the high fiber content of their foods. Diverticular disease has similar reasoning as colorectal cancer, with higher fiber intake being protective. However, respiratory diseases are not directly influenced by vegetarianism and thus would not be less frequent among vegetarians.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The diagnostic threshold for diabetes includes a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher, and a 2-hour postprandial (after meal) glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. A random glucose level greater than 200 mg/dL with symptoms also indicates diabetes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A random glucose level above 160 mg/dl indicates a significant elevation in blood sugar, which is a key characteristic of diabetes. However, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria for diagnosing diabetes include fasting plasma glucose levels \u2265 126 mg/dL or an A1C level \u2265 6.5%. Therefore, among the given options, a random glucose > 160 mg/dl is not sufficient for diagnosis without further testing.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that results in an inability to metabolize phenylalanine, which can lead to its accumulation and potential brain damage. Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener that contains phenylalanine. Therefore, individuals with PKU must avoid aspartame to prevent the harmful effects of excessive phenylalanine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Artificial sweeteners like saccharin contain phenylalanine, which individuals with phenylketonuria need to avoid, so they must avoid saccharin consumption. The other options do not have this issue.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The migrating motor complex (MMC) is a pattern of electromechanical activity observed in gastrointestinal smooth muscle during periods between meals and it clears the stomach and small intestine, not after eating. Insulin does have an effect on gastric emptying but primarily by promoting glucose uptake rather than slowing down the process directly. The increase in tone at the start of a meal is to accommodate incoming food, not for expulsion. Lastly, partially digested fat and starch do indeed slow intestinal motility as they stimulate hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK) that delay gastric emptying.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To efficiently expel its contents through the pylorus, the stomach needs to generate pressure, which is achieved by increasing its tone at the beginning of a meal. This process helps in mixing and grinding food before it moves into the small intestine.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a technique that uses low-level X-rays to differentiate between bone mass, lean tissue mass, and fat mass in the body. It can accurately measure mineral content, particularly calcium, which makes it suitable for assessing bone density as well as overall body composition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is excellent for visualizing bone structure and density, which directly correlates with mineral content. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) also measures bone mineral density but not the total body mineral content. Isotope dilution can be used to measure specific elements in the body, including minerals. Skinfold thickness is a method for estimating body fat percentage and does not directly measure mineral content.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Food availability and consumption can be measured at two main stages within the food supply chain: production (including agriculture, fisheries, etc.) and distribution/consumption (retail, households). These stages encompass where food is produced and how it reaches consumers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the stages from production to consumption, including processing, distribution, retail, and waste management, we can identify four key points to measure food availability and consumption. Therefore, there are 4 stages within the food supply chain where these measurements can be taken.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, and vegans do not consume these sources of the vitamin. As a result, they are at higher risk for deficiency unless they take supplements or eat fortified foods. Studies have shown that up to 66% of vegans may be deficient in B12 due to their dietary restrictions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given that vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, it's logical to assume that a significant majority, around two-thirds, of vegans would be deficient. This is because they exclude all sources of this nutrient from their diet unless supplemented or consuming fortified foods.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends zinc supplementation primarily for children, especially those who are severely malnourished or suffering from diarrhoea, as it helps reduce the duration and severity of these conditions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pregnant and lactating women have increased nutritional needs, and zinc plays a crucial role in fetal development and milk production, so it's logical that they would require supplementation. While children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea may also benefit from zinc, the WHO specifically recommends zinc supplements for pregnant and lactating women to ensure proper nutrient intake.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive metabolic demand refers to how the body adjusts its protein utilization efficiency in response to varying levels of intake, which can affect nitrogen balance (N-balance) studies. This adaptation means that N-balance studies may not accurately reflect true protein requirements because they might underestimate the body's ability to use proteins efficiently when intake is lower than usual. Therefore, the correct answer should acknowledge this effect on efficiency estimation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance studies are meticulously designed to account for various factors, including adaptation to different protein intakes, ensuring accurate estimations of protein requirements. The adaptive metabolic demand implies that the body can adjust its efficiency in utilizing proteins based on dietary intake levels. This means that if not properly considered, nitrogen balance studies could underestimate or overestimate protein needs due to these adaptations.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Selenium is an essential micronutrient incorporated into selenoproteins in the form of a unique amino acid called selenocysteine, which is specifically recognized and inserted during protein synthesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Selenium is commonly found in soil and water as selenate, so it's logical to assume this is the form utilized in human selenoproteins. However, selenium incorporation into proteins requires a specific amino acid, which is selenocysteine. This unique amino acid is directly inserted into the growing polypeptide chain during protein synthesis and is essential for the function of selenoproteins.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The liver secretes very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) which are responsible for transporting endogenous triglycerides, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters from the liver to peripheral tissues. VLDL is composed of both dietary derived lipids and those synthesized by the liver.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary fats from the intestines to the liver, so they must be the primary lipoprotein secreted by the liver containing dietary lipids. The other options (HDL, VLDL, LDL) are involved in different aspects of lipid metabolism but do not primarily transport dietary derived lipids.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking can negatively impact breastfeeding in multiple ways, including suppressing milk production due to nicotine affecting oxytocin release, altering the composition of breast milk which may be harmful for the infant, and increasing the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding as smoking mothers might find it more challenging to continue. Therefore, all given options are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nicotine, a key component of cigarettes, is known to constrict blood vessels and reduce blood flow, which can directly suppress milk production. Additionally, smoking has been shown to alter the composition of breast milk, potentially affecting its nutritional quality. Furthermore, mothers who smoke are more likely to stop breastfeeding earlier than non-smokers due to various factors such as social stigma and health concerns. Therefore, all options given correctly describe how smoking can affect breastfeeding.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias in dietary assessment can be reduced by ensuring accurate and unbiased data collection methods. Gathering information about many different aspects of people's dietary habits (A) may help, but it doesn't directly address the issue of bias. Collecting data at the onset of a study before disease symptoms appear (B) can reduce recall bias but not necessarily other forms of information bias. Collecting data on all possible confounders (C) is important for controlling variables in analysis but does not inherently reduce information bias in dietary assessment itself. Ensuring that the study sample is representative of the population (D) helps to generalize findings and reduces selection bias, which can contribute to overall reduction in information bias.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias arises from errors in measuring exposure or outcome variables. By collecting data on all possible confounders, we can effectively eliminate this bias and obtain accurate results. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The integration of metabolic pathways involves the interconversion of fuels, where different macromolecules are synthesized or broken down as needed for energy production or other cellular processes. Fatty acids can be converted to carbohydrates through gluconeogenesis and amino acids via transamination reactions. However, fatty acids cannot be made from carbohydrates directly due to the irreversible nature of beta-oxidation. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Carbohydrates can indeed be converted into both amino acids and fatty acids through various metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. This makes option B correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are versatile molecules that can be readily converted into carbohydrates through gluconeogenesis and into amino acids through various metabolic pathways. This interconversion is essential for maintaining energy balance and supporting different physiological needs, making it central to the integration of metabolic pathways.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the process through which the body adjusts its heat production in response to changes in nutrition, such as under- or over-nutrition, and aims to minimize energy imbalance. This mechanism helps maintain energy homeostasis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's adjustment of heat production in response to changes in food intake is primarily driven by the thermic effect of food, which varies depending on the macronutrient composition of the diet. However, adaptive thermogenesis specifically refers to the regulation and modification of energy expenditure beyond what would be expected from basal metabolism or physical activity alone in response to changes in nutritional status (under- or over-nutrition). This process helps minimize energy imbalance by adjusting heat production. Therefore, the correct answer is adaptive thermogenesis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are packaged into chylomicrons, which are lipoproteins responsible for transporting dietary lipids to various tissues. These chylomicrons then enter the lymphatic system before reaching the bloodstream. VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) is produced by the liver and not directly involved in intestinal absorption.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids are packaged into VLDL and HDL particles within the enterocytes and then secreted into the lymphatic system for transport. However, chylomicrons are responsible for carrying dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten is a group of proteins found in wheat and related grains, such as barley and rye. It is not associated with carbohydrate malabsorption or maize protein. However, gluten can be problematic for individuals with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which may include those with ulcerative colitis (UC). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it may be contraindicated in UC.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten can irritate and damage the intestinal lining, leading to inflammation and malabsorption, which are key features of ulcerative colitis. Therefore, it may be contraindicated in patients with this condition.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary patterns in Europe vary, but protein intake is generally consistent across regions due to its essential role in human nutrition and the presence of both animal and plant-based sources. While fatty acid profiles (PUFA, MUFA, SFA) may differ based on dietary habits such as Mediterranean or Nordic diets, protein intake remains fairly similar.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats are commonly found in animal products like meat and dairy, which are staples in European diets, suggesting similar consumption levels across the continent. Additionally, protein intake is also fairly consistent due to its presence in both plant-based sources (legumes) and animal-based foods.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are known to have beneficial effects on plasma LDL cholesterol levels, as they can help reduce the overall level of LDL cholesterol and improve heart health. Additionally, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids also contribute positively by reducing triglycerides and potentially lowering blood pressure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated and trans fats, found in foods like butter and red meat, are known to raise HDL cholesterol, which is considered the 'good' cholesterol, thus having a beneficial effect on overall cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), such as those found in olive oil and avocados, have been shown to lower LDL ('bad') cholesterol without affecting HDL cholesterol. Therefore, the most beneficial effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels would be from a combination of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish) and monounsaturated fatty acids.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anaemia is a condition characterized by a deficiency in the number or quality of red blood cells, which can be caused by various factors including nutrient deficiencies. Iron is essential for hemoglobin production, and copper plays a role in iron metabolism; both are crucial for healthy red blood cell function. Therefore, deficiencies in these two nutrients can lead to anaemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc and protein are essential components of red blood cells and play a crucial role in oxygen transport. Therefore, deficiencies in these nutrients can impair red blood cell production and lead to anemia. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, and vegan mothers may not consume enough of it during pregnancy. This can lead to a deficiency in their infants as the nutrient passes through breast milk or formula derived from cow's milk. Therefore, infants born to vegan mothers are at increased risk for Vitamin B12 deficiency.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is crucial for fetal development, and since vegan diets may lack sufficient folate sources, infants born to vegan mothers are at risk of deficiency. Vitamin C, B12, and Calcium can also be affected in a vegan diet but the most significant concern specifically related to maternal veganism is Folate.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Energy balance in a healthy person is maintained through the equilibrium of energy intake and expenditure, which can fluctuate daily due to variations in dietary habits and physical activity levels. The body has mechanisms to adjust metabolism based on short-term changes in calorie consumption or use. Therefore, maintaining energy balance typically occurs on a day-to-day basis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body tightly regulates energy balance through hunger and satiety signals, ensuring that energy intake matches expenditure on a day-to-day basis. This dynamic process allows for adjustments in response to varying activity levels and dietary intake.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Green Revolution was a period marked by significant increases in agricultural production, particularly of staple crops like wheat and rice, due to advancements such as high-yielding varieties (HYVs), improved irrigation, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides. This revolution began in the mid-20th century and had a profound impact on food security in developing countries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Green Revolution, with its emphasis on environmental sustainability and resource conservation, aligns with the goals of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, making it a likely reference point. However, considering the specific context of agricultural advancements in developing countries during the mid-1960s, the most accurate answer is related to cereal crop varieties.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Diabetes prevention trials have shown that lifestyle modifications, including weight loss through a hypocaloric low-fat diet combined with regular physical activity, can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since type 2 diabetes is often treated with metformin, it makes sense that high-risk individuals can prevent diabetes by taking metformin and exercising vigorously. This combination helps improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acid scoring involves comparing a protein's essential amino acid content to a reference pattern, which is typically based on human requirements. Different age groups have varying nutritional needs; therefore, different reference patterns are used for each group.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Egg protein is considered a complete protein with all essential amino acids, so it makes sense that it would be the reference point for calculating the amino acid score. This method compares the amount of each essential amino acid in the test protein to the amounts found in egg protein.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B1 and Folate are abundant in plant-based foods, while Vitamin A can be obtained from beta-carotene found in fruits and vegetables. However, Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs, making it difficult for vegans to obtain sufficient amounts without supplementation or fortified foods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegans tend to eat a lot of leafy green vegetables, which are rich in folate, so it's unlikely they would be deficient in this vitamin. Vitamins B1 and A can also be found in plant-based foods like whole grains and carrots respectively. However, Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, making it the most likely to be lacking in a vegan diet.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food security encompasses not only the availability of food but also its utilization, stability over time, and access for all individuals to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs. While ending micronutrient malnutrition is a part of it, food security has broader components.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Food security sounds like it's about keeping food supplies safe and secure, so it must be related to preventing terrorists from poisoning the food. However, this definition is too narrow and doesn't encompass all aspects of food security.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Oral bacteria can metabolize simple sugars like maltose, glucose and small carbohydrates such as malto-triose due to their enzymatic capabilities. However, starch is a complex polysaccharide that requires more extensive breakdown before it can be utilized by bacteria. Thus, the type of carbohydrate that cannot be metabolised directly by oral bacteria from the given options is starch.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Maltose and starch are both complex carbohydrates made up of glucose units, so if oral bacteria can't metabolize starch, they probably can't metabolize maltose either. Glucose is a simple sugar that most organisms, including oral bacteria, can readily metabolize. Malto-triose, however, is not typically found in the human diet and isn't produced by the breakdown of common carbohydrates like starches or sugars.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats like olive oil, which have been associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. On the other hand, the Western diet, high in processed foods and saturated fats, has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive issues. Therefore, among the given options, the Mediterranean diet shows most promise in preventing age-related cognitive decline.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the Western diet and the Mediterranean diet are associated with various health problems, so it's unlikely that either would be beneficial for preventing cognitive decline. However, research has shown that the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and olive oil, may help protect against age-related cognitive decline due to its anti-inflammatory properties.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. T.R. Malthus predicted that population growth would outpace food production due to geometric and arithmetic rates of increase, respectively. However, technological advancements in agriculture, such as the Green Revolution, improved crop yields significantly. Additionally, institutional innovations have helped distribute food more efficiently globally. These factors have allowed food supplies to keep pace with or even exceed population growth over time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified foods have significantly increased crop yields and food production, so it's likely that they are the main reason why food supplies have kept pace with population growth. However, this doesn't mean Malthus was entirely wrong as his theory still holds relevance in certain contexts.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The energy content of ethanol is well-established in nutritional science, and it is known that one gram of ethanol contains approximately 7 kilocalories (kcal). Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this value.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is known to be high in calories, so one gram of ethanol must contain a significant amount of energy, likely around 8.1 kcal. This makes option D the most plausible answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Fibre supplements are often recommended for diverticular disease to help manage symptoms and prevent complications, making option A the correct choice. Option B is incorrect as not all fibres are easily fermented by colonic bacteria; some may be resistant or slowly fermentable. Option C is also incorrect because fibre supplements can come from both soluble and insoluble sources. Lastly, option D is wrong since fibre supplements are typically recommended to alleviate constipation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fiber supplements are meant to promote gut health, and since gut bacteria ferment fiber, it's safe to assume that all fiber supplements are easily fermented by colonic bacteria. However, this is not always the case as some fibers may be less fermentable than others.",B

The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) is a validated, simple tool that can be used to identify adults who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition on admission to hospitals and the community. It assesses body mass index (BMI), unintentional weight loss, and effect of acute disease on intake for more than 5 days.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Serum albumin is a protein that can be affected by malnutrition, so measuring its concentration should be a good way to screen for malnutrition on admission to the hospital. The MUST tool and demi-span are not specific methods used for nutritional assessment in this context. A 7-day food diary is impractical as it requires patients to recall their intake over an extended period, which may be challenging upon admission.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Water absorption primarily occurs through osmosis, driven by solute concentration gradients across enterocyte membranes and tight junctions between cells lining the gut. The 'flip-flop' mechanism is not a recognized process for water transport in this context. While dietary intake of water contributes to overall hydration, it does not directly correlate with absorption rates in the small intestine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Water can move in both directions across the intestinal membrane, so there must be a 'flip-flop' mechanism that efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane. This is due to osmosis and active transport processes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Triglycerides, which are large molecules, need to be broken down into smaller components (fatty acids and monoglycerides) before they can be absorbed in the small intestine. This process involves emulsification by bile salts followed by enzymatic digestion by pancreatic lipases. Once broken down, these smaller molecules are then able to be transported across the enterocyte membrane.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mixed micelles increase the surface area of fats, which should improve their interaction with enzymes and therefore increase absorption. This process involves pancreatic cholesterol and phospholipids.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure can result from various causes, including surgical removal of the colon (colectomy), which may lead to an inability to absorb nutrients properly. While parenteral nutrition is often used as a supportive measure, it does not always require it if enteral feeding or other interventions are possible. Intestinal failure can be either temporary or permanent depending on the underlying cause and response to treatment. Sodium supplementation may be beneficial in some cases of intestinal failure but is not a defining characteristic.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure means the intestines are not functioning properly, so patients would always need to receive nutrition through an IV, which is parenteral nutrition. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The UNICEF model of malnutrition identifies immediate, underlying, and basic causes. Immediate causes are related to dietary intake and disease, while underlying causes include factors like food production, access to health services, and care practices. Insufficient rainfall for agriculture is considered a basic cause as it affects the overall availability of food resources.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Insufficient health services and an unhealthy environment are fundamental issues that contribute to malnutrition, so they should be classified as basic causes in the UNICEF model. The immediate cause is typically related to dietary intake or disease status. Underlying causes include factors like food production, access to food, and care for mothers and children. Therefore, 'Insufficient rainfall for agriculture' (A) can be considered an underlying cause as it affects food production.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that vegans can obtain from linolenic acid, which they consume through plant sources like flaxseeds and walnuts. It can also be synthesized directly from microalgae supplements. While DHA deficiency may cause visual and cognitive impairment, it is not absent from all vegan diets if they include these sources or supplements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Microalgae are a good source of nutrients for vegans, and since docosahexaenoic acid is important, it makes sense that microalgae can be used to synthesize it for vegans. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can indeed be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid in the body, which is present in plant sources consumed by vegans. However, statement B claims DHA is absent from vegan diets, which contradicts the fact that it can be obtained through conversion or direct consumption of microalgae.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight and out of these, over 650 million were obese. This indicates that approximately one-third of the global population is either overweight or obese. Therefore, the closest answer to this prevalence would be 39%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While obesity is a growing concern, the worldwide prevalence seems relatively low, likely around 11%, considering the efforts to promote healthy lifestyles. The other options seem too high for global statistics.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Consumption of alcohol is a known risk factor for oesophageal cancer, as it can cause irritation and damage to the lining of the esophagus over time. Processed meat has been linked with colorectal cancer but not specifically oesophageal cancer. Fruit and vegetables are generally protective against many types of cancer due to their high antioxidant content, while salt is more commonly associated with stomach cancer rather than esophageal cancer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Processed meat is generally considered unhealthy and linked to cancer, so it's likely a risk factor for esophageal cancer as well. Fruit and vegetables are typically associated with reduced cancer risks due to their high nutrient content. Salt intake has been linked to stomach cancer but not specifically to esophageal cancer. Alcohol consumption, especially heavy drinking, is a known risk factor for various cancers including esophageal cancer.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is metabolized in the body primarily through two enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The first step of this process converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, a highly reactive and toxic compound. Acetaldehyde is known for its carcinogenic properties as it can damage DNA and proteins, leading to mutations that may result in cancer development. Therefore, the alcohol metabolite playing a prominent role in cancer development is acetaldehyde.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Acetate is a well-known metabolite produced during alcohol metabolism, so it's likely the main culprit in alcohol-related cancer development. However, acetaldehyde, another product of alcohol metabolism, has been identified as a potent carcinogen and plays a significant role in promoting DNA damage and mutations that can lead to cancer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The oxidation of protein in the body is related to nitrogen metabolism, as proteins contain nitrogen. Total urinary nitrogen excretion reflects the amount of nitrogen that has been processed and eliminated from the body, which can be used to estimate protein oxidation indirectly.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Protein oxidation involves the breakdown of amino acids, which requires oxygen, so measuring O2 consumption should be enough to determine the amount of protein oxidized. CO2 production and breath collection are related to overall metabolism but not specifically to protein oxidation. Total urinary nitrogen excretion alone does not account for all sources of nitrogen loss in the body, such as sweat or feces.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydroxylation reactions in collagen synthesis require a cofactor that acts as an antioxidant and is essential for the formation of hydroxyproline, which stabilizes the collagen triple helix structure. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) fulfills this role by acting as a reducing agent to maintain the enzymes involved in these reactions active.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is a key component of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are essential coenzymes for various redox reactions in the body, including hydroxylation. Hydroxylation reactions play an important role in collagen synthesis by adding hydroxyl groups to proline residues, thus stabilizing the triple helix structure of collagen. Therefore, riboflavin is crucial for this process.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol metabolism primarily occurs in the liver through two main enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). ADH converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, which is then further metabolized by ALDH into acetate. Acetate can be converted into acetyl-CoA for energy production or used in the synthesis of lipids.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol metabolism involves the breakdown of ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then converted to acetate. Acetate can then enter the citric acid cycle and be further metabolized to pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. However, the main direct products are acetaldehyde and acetate.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation primarily occurs in mitochondria, not peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are involved in the oxidation of very long chain fatty acids to medium chain products and degradation of xenobiotics and eicosanoids.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peroxisomes are the main site of fatty acid β-oxidation, especially for very long chain fatty acids, while mitochondria also play a role in oxidizing fatty acids of various lengths. The rate of β-oxidation is indeed regulated by the availability of fatty acids and their utilization products. Peroxisomes are involved in degrading xenobiotics and eicosanoids, but they are not the major site for fatty acid β-oxidation.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. While there may be differences in body mass index (BMI) between vegetarians and meat-eaters, the exact difference can vary widely depending on individual dietary habits, exercise routines, and genetic factors. However, research suggests that vegetarians tend to have a slightly lower BMI compared to non-vegetarians due to their typically higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains which are less calorie-dense than meat products. Among the given options, '1 unit of BMI' seems like a reasonable average difference considering these factors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in calories and fat compared to diets that include meat, leading to a substantial difference in BMI, with vegetarians typically having a BMI around 3 units lower than meat-eaters. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 3 units of BMI.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the primary goal is to extract and utilize the energy and nutrients contained in the food for immediate survival needs such as maintaining blood sugar levels and providing fuel for cellular processes. Therefore, the most important function immediately after a meal would be the extraction of maximum value from nutrients.",D,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body's primary focus is on extracting the maximum nutritional value from the ingested food, ensuring efficient absorption and utilization of nutrients for energy and growth. This process directly impacts survival as it provides essential fuel for bodily functions.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anthropometric measures are used to assess the size, shape and composition of the human body. Among the options provided, body weight is the most straightforward and frequently used measure for estimating overall body mass as it can be easily measured using a scale.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Body height is the most commonly used anthropometric measure to estimate body mass, as it provides a simple and readily available indicator of overall body size. While fat-free mass, body fat, and body weight are also related to body mass, they require more complex measurements or calculations.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Older individuals often experience reduced appetite and changes in taste, leading to lower energy intake compared to younger adults. This can result from a combination of factors such as decreased physical activity, altered metabolism, and social or psychological issues.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Older people often have reduced appetites and may consume less food overall, leading to a lower intake of fat than the recommended levels for their age group. This makes option A correct as it aligns with common dietary patterns observed in older populations.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. To evaluate the safety of a food substance, it is essential to understand how much of that substance humans are actually consuming in their diet. This requires data on rates of consumption and concentration levels within the food. However, combining this with daily intake provides a more direct measure of exposure for individuals. Therefore, the most relevant type of data would be the daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To evaluate the safety of a food substance, it is crucial to consider the rates of consumption of the food to which the substance is added, as this determines the overall exposure level for individuals. This information helps in assessing potential risks and establishing safe levels of intake.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Eicosanoids are signaling molecules made from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically arachidonic acid (C20) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20). These precursors must be polyunsaturated to allow for the necessary enzymatic reactions that produce various types of eicosanoids. Therefore, the correct answer is D: C20 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Eicosanoids are derived from C18 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which serve as precursors for these signaling molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) involves consuming large amounts of food in short periods, often leading to obesity due to high-calorie intake during binge episodes. Patients with BED have higher odds of developing obesity compared to those without the disorder. Spontaneous remission is possible as individuals may overcome their eating patterns over time or through therapy. However, bariatric surgery is typically considered for severe cases where other treatments have failed and not mild cases.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery can be an effective treatment option for Binge Eating Disorder, even in mild cases, as it helps to reduce food intake and promote weight loss. Therefore, the statement that bariatric surgery cannot be considered a treatment option is incorrect.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) refers to the condition where a fetus is smaller than expected for the number of weeks of pregnancy, which means its weight falls below the normal range for its gestational age. This definition aligns with option C: birth weight below a population threshold for gestational age.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Impaired fetal growth, known as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), is synonymous with preterm birth, as both conditions involve infants being born before reaching full gestational age. However, IUGR specifically refers to a fetus that has not reached its expected size for the number of weeks of pregnancy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Randomized controlled trials are not observational studies, they are experimental. Ecological studies can be prone to ecological fallacy and may not accurately reflect individual behaviors. Case-control studies are retrospective and might suffer from recall bias. Prospective studies follow individuals over time, collecting data on their dietary habits before the development of cancer, making them more reliable for investigating links between diet and cancer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Case-control studies are the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer, as they allow for the comparison of dietary exposures between individuals with and without the disease. This design is particularly useful when studying rare diseases or those with long latency periods like cancer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids, isoflavones, inositol phosphates, lignans, isothiocyanates, indoles, phenols and sulphides and thiols are all types of compounds found in plants that have various biological activities. They are not classified as fibres or vitamins specifically but rather fall under the broader category of phytochemicals which contribute to plant's nutritional value.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids, isoflavones, inositol phosphates, lignans, isothiocyanates, indoles, phenols, sulfides, and thiols are all sources of dietary fiber, which is essential for digestive health and overall well-being. These compounds are found naturally in various plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Options A, B, and C all represent common reasons for following a vegetarian diet: religious beliefs often include dietary restrictions or preferences; many people choose vegetarianism for health benefits; reducing carbon emissions is an environmental concern that can be addressed through plant-based diets. Therefore, the correct answer must indicate that none of these options are incorrect reasons.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason why people choose to follow a vegetarian diet is for better health, as it has been associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Additionally, some individuals may adopt this lifestyle due to religious beliefs or ethical reasons related to animal welfare. Furthermore, a vegetarian diet is considered more environmentally friendly since it generally requires fewer resources and produces lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to meat-based diets.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. An 'exposure' in epidemiology refers to any contact with factors that may affect health positively or negatively. This includes environmental elements, behaviors, and lifestyle choices such as dietary intake. Therefore, the statement about exposures being only harmful is too narrow, and considering body mass index (BMI) a non-exposure because it's associated with multiple health conditions doesn't align with how exposures are defined in epidemiology.",A,"Let's reason step by step. An 'exposure' refers to contact with a factor that may influence health, and an exposed individual inherently has a greater risk of developing a disease or experiencing a health outcome related to that exposure. Dietary intake is indeed considered an exposure as it can affect health outcomes regardless of personal choice. High body mass index (BMI) itself is not the exposure but rather a potential result of various exposures, such as diet and physical activity.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Older adults often have a lower risk of iron overload due to decreased dietary intake and absorption, making option A less likely. While vitamin D status can be low in older individuals living in Western countries due to reduced sun exposure, it is not accurate that all older people have low levels (option B). There isn't strong evidence supporting the claim that vitamin C supplements significantly lower cancer risk in older adults (option C). However, age-related changes can lead to decreased absorption of vitamin B12 from food sources, making option D a correct statement.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Due to limited sun exposure and reduced dietary intake, all older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status, which can impact bone health and overall well-being. The other options are not universally correct for the entire population of older individuals.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A risk ratio (RR) less than 1 indicates a lower risk of developing the outcome for the exposed group compared to the unexposed group. In this case, tea drinkers have an RR of 0.86, which means they have a reduced risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tea drinkers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A risk ratio of 0.86 suggests that tea drinkers have a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to those who do not drink tea, indicating a potential protective effect of tea consumption. The value is less than one and significantly different from one.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is known for its role in calcium absorption, regulating bone health and influencing cell differentiation. However, it does not act as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes; that function is typically associated with vitamins E and A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, protecting them from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. It also plays a crucial role in the regulation of calcium absorption and bone turnover through gene expression changes. However, vitamin D does not directly regulate adipocyte differentiation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate is a crucial step in cellular respiration, and it requires the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). TPP is derived from vitamin B1, also known as thiamin. Therefore, among the given options, thiamin provides the necessary coenzyme for this process.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin, in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), plays a crucial role as a coenzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, a key step in cellular respiration. Therefore, among the given options, niacin is responsible for providing this essential coenzyme.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Ulcerative Colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and rectum, leading to ulcers in the lining of the large intestine. It has been associated with an increased risk of colon cancer due to long-standing inflammation. While dietary modifications like LOFFLEX may help manage symptoms, they do not cause or cure Ulcerative Colitis. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and milk intolerance are more commonly associated with other gastrointestinal conditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ulcerative Colitis can be effectively managed with a LOFFLEX diet, which is a low-residue, low-fiber dietary approach that helps to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. While it may carry some risk of colon cancer over time, the primary association here is its treatment.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. As incomes rise, people tend to diversify their diets and include more expensive food items that were previously considered luxury or non-essential. Urbanization often leads to changes in lifestyle and eating habits, with a shift towards convenience and processed foods. Among the options provided, meat and dairy products are typically more expensive than roots, tubers, beans, and lentils, and their consumption is known to increase as people's income levels rise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With rising incomes and urbanization, people tend to have more disposable income and access to a wider variety of foods, including protein-rich options like beans and lentils. Additionally, the demand for meat and dairy products is also increasing due to changing dietary preferences and cultural influences.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Digestible energy intake is the gross energy intake minus the energy content of faeces, which would be 9279 - 647 = 8632 kJ. Metabolisable energy intake further subtracts the energy content of urine from digestible energy intake, resulting in 8632 - 318 = 8314 kJ.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Digestible energy intake refers to the energy lost in faeces, while metabolizable energy intake refers to the energy lost in urine. So, the answer should be the values for faeces and urine energy content. However, these are losses from the gross energy intake.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is known for its role in vision, immune function, reproduction, and cellular communication. It does not directly participate in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins or activation of vitamin D receptors; however, it plays a crucial role in gene expression and cell differentiation. Among the options given, the activation of thyroid hormone receptors is primarily associated with iodine and not directly linked to Vitamin A functions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation, similar to how thyroid hormone receptors influence gene activity and cell development. However, vitamin A is not directly involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins or activation of vitamin D receptors. Among the options given, the function that does not belong to Vitamin A's role is 'Activation of thyroid hormone receptors'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The vagus nerve actually stimulates acid secretion in response to food intake, not inhibits it. Peyer's patches are associated with the small intestine and immune function, not stomach acid production. Carbonic anhydrase is involved in pH regulation but does not directly cause acid secretion. Pepsinogen and gastric lipase are indeed enzymes that are secreted into the lumen of the stomach to aid digestion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbonic anhydrase is a key enzyme involved in the production of stomach acid, playing a crucial role in creating the acidic environment necessary for digestion. Peyer's patches are actually found in the small intestine and not responsible for acid secretion. The vagus nerve stimulates rather than inhibits acid secretion after food consumption. Pepsinogen is an enzyme precursor that gets activated to pepsin, which aids protein digestion, while gastric lipase helps break down fats. Therefore, the correct statement about the stomach is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to the energy expended during non-exercise activities related to an office job, such as standing and walking to a file cabinet. This type of activity falls under Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT), which includes all the calories burned through daily movements outside of structured exercise.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The energy used for basic activities like standing and walking around the office contributes to the basal metabolic rate, which represents the energy expenditure for essential bodily functions at rest. However, NEAT specifically refers to the calories burned during non-exercise movements throughout the day, such as those mentioned in the question.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique is a sophisticated method for measuring total energy expenditure, but it does not directly measure intake or identify under-reporting of specific food items. It provides an overall marker for energy balance rather than detailed information on individual nutrient consumption. Therefore, mis-reporting of low energy content foods would not be identified using this technique.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique primarily serves as a marker for energy intake, providing information about the total amount of energy consumed by an individual. However, it does not account for mis-reporting or underestimation of low energy content foods, which can lead to inaccuracies in assessing usual intake. Additionally, its sophisticated analytical technique may pose challenges and limitations.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Non-haem iron bioavailability is influenced by various dietary factors, with phytic acid being a well-known inhibitor due to its ability to chelate and form insoluble complexes with non-haem iron, reducing its absorption. Citric acid actually enhances iron absorption, while vegetable protein has a moderate effect on both enhancing and inhibiting iron bioavailability depending on the context. Calcium can also inhibit iron absorption but to a lesser extent than phytic acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Citric acid, often found in high amounts in fruits and vegetables, can bind to non-haem iron and hinder its absorption in the digestive tract. Phytic acid also has a similar effect but is less potent than citric acid. Vegetable protein does not significantly affect non-haem iron bioavailability. Calcium competes with iron for absorption, but it primarily impacts haem iron rather than non-haem iron.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butyrate, curcumin, and genistein have all been shown to influence epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification. Therefore, each of these compounds has the potential to affect gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Genistein, a compound found in soybeans and other legumes, is known to have epigenetic effects, influencing gene expression through modifications to DNA and histone proteins. Butyrate, produced from the fermentation of dietary fibers by gut bacteria, also has well-documented epigenetic impacts on cellular processes. Curcumin, a compound in turmeric, is recognized for its anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms as well. Therefore, all the options given have documented evidence of exerting epigenetic effects.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Climate change has been linked with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, storms, and floods which can negatively impact agricultural productivity. This is particularly concerning for developing countries that rely heavily on agriculture for food security. While there may be some positive effects like reduced malaria transmission or enhanced plant photosynthesis due to increased CO2 levels, the overall consensus in scientific literature points towards negative impacts of climate change on future food security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Climate change will lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is beneficial for plant growth and can enhance crop yields, thus improving food security. However, this positive effect may be outweighed by negative impacts such as increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, storms, and floods that could damage crops and disrupt agricultural systems.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries, also known as tooth decay or cavities, is a common dental problem worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is estimated that about 60-90% of school children and nearly 100% of adults have dental caries in their permanent teeth. However, this question specifically asks for untreated cases. Considering global accessibility to dental care varies significantly, a large proportion remains untreated. The closest estimate among the options provided is that around 60% of dental caries remain untreated globally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the limited access to dental care in many parts of the world, it's reasonable to estimate that a significant majority, around 80%, of dental caries cases remain untreated globally. This high percentage reflects disparities in healthcare availability and affordability.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Eating Disorders (ED) continue to be a significant public health concern, so option A is incorrect as their prevalence has not decreased over the last decades. Binge-Eating Disorder (BED) can occur in individuals of any weight, making option C incorrect. While impulsivity and comorbid disorders are common among those with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), it is not accurate to say that all individuals with BN have these characteristics or a borderline personality disorder, so option D is also incorrect. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has been consistently reported as having the highest mortality rate among mental disorders due to medical complications and suicide risk.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With growing awareness and improved treatment options for eating disorders, we've seen a decrease in their prevalence over the last few decades. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is known to have one of the highest mortality rates among mental health conditions due to severe malnutrition and its complications. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) can occur in individuals regardless of weight, not exclusively in obese subjects. While impulsivity may be a characteristic seen in some with Bulimia Nervosa (BN), it is incorrect to say that all individuals with BN are predominantly impulsive and have comorbid borderline personality disorder.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. During protein synthesis, only a specific region of the DNA is transcribed into mRNA through the process of transcription. This mRNA then undergoes splicing and other modifications to become mature mRNA before it can be translated into a protein. Not all information in DNA codes for proteins; some regions are non-coding, and only one strand (the template strand) is used for transcription.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During transcription, both strands of the DNA molecule are copied to create two identical mRNA molecules, ensuring redundancy in the genetic information. However, only one of these RNA strands is used as a template for protein synthesis after undergoing splicing and modifications to form mature mRNA.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on carbohydrates for energy due to their quick availability and efficient conversion into ATP. Muscle glycogen is a readily accessible source of glucose within muscles that can be rapidly metabolized during such activities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on intramuscular lipids as the main source of energy due to their accessibility within muscle cells. Muscle glycogen is also a significant contributor but becomes more important during prolonged endurance activities. Liver glycogen and adipose tissue lipid are less utilized in this context.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Non-coding RNAs are types of RNA that do not encode for proteins but have other functions in the cell, such as regulation and structural roles. mRNA (messenger RNA) is responsible for carrying genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis, making it a coding RNA.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Non-coding RNAs, like miRNA, do not code for proteins but instead play crucial regulatory roles in various cellular processes, including gene expression and protein synthesis. mRNA (messenger RNA), on the other hand, carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes where it is translated into a protein. Therefore, mRNA is not a non-coding RNA.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is associated with increased levels of adipose tissue, which can lead to higher production and circulation of estrogen due to aromatization in fat cells. Elevated estrogen levels are known to stimulate the endometrial lining, increasing the risk of hyperplasia and cancerous growths.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly elevated levels of thyroxine, which may contribute to the increased risk of endometrial cancer observed in obese women. Thyroxine is a key regulator of metabolism and energy balance.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins can be sensitive to heat, light, or water during cooking processes. Riboflavin (B2) is known to degrade in the presence of light and high temperatures, while vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is highly susceptible to oxidation when exposed to air and heat. Therefore, these two vitamins are most likely to be lost during cooking.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E and niacin are particularly sensitive to heat and are easily destroyed during cooking processes, leading to significant losses in their content. Therefore, the correct answer is vitamin E and niacin.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia Nervosa is characterized by significant weight loss, body image distortion, and an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. While depressive symptoms can be associated with many mental health disorders, they are not a diagnostic feature specific to Anorexia Nervosa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Significant weight loss is a hallmark feature of Anorexia Nervosa, often accompanied by depressive symptoms and a distorted body image. However, while fear of gaining weight or becoming fat is also common in individuals with this disorder, it is not considered a diagnostic criterion according to the DSM-5. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Phytic acid, found in plant seeds and grains, can bind to certain minerals like calcium, zinc, and iron, reducing their absorption. However, potassium is not affected by phytic acid as it does not form insoluble complexes with it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. High intakes of phytic acid from foods like grains and legumes do not significantly impact the absorption of essential minerals like iron. Phytic acid primarily affects the bioavailability of calcium, zinc, and magnesium due to its chelating properties.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life to ensure optimal growth, development and health. Introducing solids at 4 months is not recommended as it may interfere with exclusive breastfeeding benefits. Cow's milk isn't suitable until after one year due to potential allergies and nutritional imbalances. Breastfeeding is generally considered superior to bottle feeding for the baby's immune system development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Current recommendations suggest that cow's milk is a suitable and nutritious option for all children starting from 6 months of age, providing essential nutrients for growth and development. It serves as an appropriate source of protein, calcium, and vitamins.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The student is experiencing abdominal cramps and diarrhea after consuming milk, which suggests a problem with digesting lactose found in dairy products. This condition is known as lactose intolerance, commonly caused by the deficiency of small intestine lactase enzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose for absorption.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The student is experiencing abdominal cramps and diarrhoea after drinking milk, which are common symptoms of bacterial or yeast overgrowth in the small intestine. However, these conditions typically do not cause immediate reactions to specific food items like milk. Lack of pancreatic amylase would affect carbohydrate digestion but wouldn't specifically trigger a reaction to milk consumption. Similarly, lack of sucrase-isomaltase would impact the breakdown of certain sugars but is not directly related to lactose intolerance. Given that the symptoms occur after consuming milk and considering geographical factors (Sudan has high rates of lactose intolerance), it's most likely due to a lack of small intestinal lactase, which would cause difficulty digesting lactose found in milk.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural polyunsaturated fatty acids typically have more than one carbon-carbon double bond and are found in vegetable oils. The most common ones, like linoleic acid (18 carbons) and alpha-linolenic acid (also 18 carbons), contain multiple cis double bonds rather than trans or a single double bond.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetable oils are known to contain polyunsaturated fatty acids with carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration, which is more stable than the cis configuration. However, most natural unsaturated fats found in vegetables have their double bonds in the cis configuration and typically consist of 18 or fewer carbon atoms.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood hemoglobin levels are influenced by various factors beyond iron status, such as lead poisoning or chronic diseases, which can cause misleading results when assessing iron deficiency or overload. On the other hand, serum ferritin and transferrin receptors provide a more direct reflection of body iron stores and iron utilization, respectively.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Specific indices of iron status, such as serum ferritin and transferrin receptors, are likely more reliable because they can be measured with greater accuracy and ease compared to blood haemoglobin levels. Additionally, these specific indices provide a direct measure of the body's iron stores or demand for iron.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The protein requirement for an individual or a population is determined based on their needs and how efficiently they utilize dietary proteins. It cannot be less than the actual demand, nor can it always match exactly with the demand due to variations in efficiency of utilization. Therefore, the correct statement would be that the protein requirement equals the demand divided by the efficiency of utilization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The protein requirement refers to the minimum amount of protein needed, which can sometimes be less than the actual demand depending on individual factors and dietary intake. It does not directly equate to demand multiplied or divided by efficiency of utilization.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Potassium helps to balance the amount of sodium in cells, which can help lower blood pressure. Sodium is known to increase blood pressure when consumed in high amounts. Polyunsaturated fatty acids have a positive effect on heart health but are not directly linked with hypertension improvement. Cholesterol has no direct impact on improving hypertension.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to have various health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, which could indirectly contribute to better blood pressure control. However, the direct dietary component that has been shown to improve hypertension is potassium, as it helps balance out sodium levels and relaxes blood vessel walls.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins are absorbed in the intestine through various mechanisms depending on their solubility and chemical structure. Option B refers to vitamin E, which is fat-soluble and does not require a specific protein for its absorption. Option C involves thiamine pyrophosphate or pyridoxal phosphate, but these are coenzyme forms of vitamins B1 and B6, respectively, and their dephosphorylation isn't necessary for absorption. Option D is correct as oxidized vitamin C (dehydroascorbic acid) can indeed be absorbed by a glucose transporter due to its similarity in structure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins like thiamine pyrophosphate and pyridoxal phosphate need to be dephosphorylated, meaning the phosphate groups removed, before they can be effectively absorbed in the intestine. This process allows them to cross cell membranes more easily.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The fear of becoming fat in patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a persistent concern about gaining weight or becoming fat, even when underweight. This belief does not typically reach the level of delusion seen in psychotic disorders but rather represents an overvalued idea that significantly influences behavior and thinking patterns.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The intense fear of becoming fat in patients with anorexia nervosa is a fixed, false belief that is not amenable to reason, indicating a paranoid delusion. This irrational fear drives the extreme behaviors seen in these individuals.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A food additive is considered safe when it meets certain criteria, including no observed toxicity and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) level that ensures safety even with regular consumption. The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) being less than the ADI indicates a margin of safety between actual exposure and levels known to be without adverse effects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A food additive is deemed safe if its perceived benefits for enhancing food quality, preservation, or taste outweigh any potential risks associated with its consumption. This assessment involves considering factors such as toxicity levels and estimated daily intake (EDI) compared to acceptable daily intake (ADI). Among the options provided, the one that best captures this principle is when the benefits of using a food additive outweigh any potential risks.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A binge eating episode is characterized by both a subjective sense of lack of control over eating and an objective large amount of food consumed in a discrete period, typically within 2 hours. This definition aligns with the criteria set forth by diagnostic manuals for eating disorders.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A binge eating episode is characterized by the individual's perception of their eating habits as chaotic and out of control, regardless of the actual amount of food consumed. This includes a subjective feeling of lack of control over eating during an episode and objectively consuming large amounts of food within a discrete period of time.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The thermic effect of food (TEF) refers to the increase in metabolic rate after ingestion of a meal, which is influenced by macronutrient composition and digestive processes. Protein has a higher TEF compared to carbohydrates due to its complex structure requiring more energy for digestion and absorption. Sympathetic activity stimulation in the postprandial phase can contribute to increased metabolic rate, which is related to TEF.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The thermic effect of food refers to the energy used for digestion and absorption, which leads to a slight decrease in body core temperature as energy is expended. Therefore, option B correctly describes this phenomenon.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) that falls within the range of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, indicating excess weight but not yet in the obesity category.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Overweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 25 to 30 kg/m2, indicating an excess of body weight relative to height. This definition helps identify individuals who may be at risk for health problems associated with being overweight.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol is a lipid molecule that plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity and fluidity of animal cell membranes, particularly mammalian cells. It does not occur in bacterial or plant cell walls as these organisms have different structures for their cell walls (peptidoglycan in bacteria and cellulose in plants). Yeast is a type of fungus, which also has cholesterol in its membranes but it's more accurate to associate cholesterol with mammalian cells. Therefore, the correct answer is that cholesterol mainly occurs in the cell walls of mammalian cells.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol is a crucial component of bacterial cell walls, providing structural support and influencing membrane fluidity. It plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity and function of these cells.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The largest endogenous substrate source in the body refers to the primary internal reservoir of energy-rich compounds that can be mobilized during periods of increased demand, such as fasting or exercise. Adipose tissue is specialized for long-term energy storage and contains a vast amount of triglycerides compared to other options listed.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a central role in energy metabolism, and its glycogen stores represent the largest readily available source of endogenous substrate in the body. Muscle glycogen is also significant but primarily serves local muscular needs during exercise. Intramuscular lipids are important for prolonged activity, while adipose tissue provides a vast energy reserve through fatty acids.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes glucose uptake and storage, so it activates glycogen synthase rather than suppresses it (eliminating A). Glucose transport into the brain is not primarily mediated by insulin but occurs via GLUT1 transporters (eliminating B). Prediabetes indeed refers to a state where blood sugar levels are higher than normal, indicating an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future. The rise in insulin concentration after meal ingestion is typically reduced or absent in both types of diabetes due to impaired beta-cell function (eliminating D).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a key hormone that facilitates glucose uptake in various tissues, including the brain, ensuring a steady supply of energy for neuronal function. While insulin does influence glycogen synthesis and its concentration changes after meals can be affected by diabetes types, these statements are not universally correct or as directly related to insulin's primary functions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as certain amino acids and glycerol. Glutamic acid (A) and Aspartic acid (B) are both amino acids that can be converted into intermediates for gluconeogenesis. Galactose (D) is a monosaccharide that can also enter the pathway after conversion to glucose-1-phosphate. However, Palmitic acid (C), being a fatty acid, cannot directly serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aspartic acid, like certain other amino acids, cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis due to its chemical structure and metabolic pathways. The other options can all contribute to the production of glucose in some way.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Dutch Hunger Winter was a famine that occurred during World War II, and studies have shown that in utero exposure to this event had long-lasting effects on the health of offspring. Research indicates that prenatal nutritional deficiencies can lead to epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation alterations. The most significant impacts were observed when the famine occurred during the early stages of pregnancy, specifically in the first trimester.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The third trimester of pregnancy is a critical period for fetal growth and development, making it likely the stage where in utero exposure to famine would have the most significant effects on DNA methylation. This aligns with research findings that show prenatal nutritional deficiencies during this time can lead to long-term epigenetic changes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is a process that occurs throughout life, but it is most rapid during childhood and adolescence when bones are growing and developing. This period of growth helps to build strong bones that can reduce the risk of fractures in old age. Therefore, the correct answer is that bone mineral accretion in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood predicts the risk of fracture in old age.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is most rapid during the first 10 weeks of fetal life when the skeletal system is initially forming, laying the foundation for future bone health. This period is crucial as it sets the stage for peak bone mass development later in life.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Long-term intervention studies with large sample sizes that focus on fractures as an endpoint provide strong evidence for the association between diet and skeletal health, as they can demonstrate a direct impact of dietary changes over time on bone strength and fracture risk.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Experimental studies that utilize biochemical markers to measure bone remodelling processes provide strong evidence for the association between diet and skeletal health, as they capture the dynamic changes occurring in bone metabolism. This approach allows researchers to understand how specific nutrients or dietary patterns influence bone formation and resorption over time.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine is primarily found in seafood, dairy products, and iodized salt. Central Africa has limited access to these sources due to geographical constraints. Therefore, relying solely on locally grown food in central Africa could lead to an insufficient intake of iodine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency can arise from a diet low in fruits and vegetables, as these food groups are often rich sources of essential minerals, including iodine. However, the most direct cause among the options provided is consuming only locally grown food in central Africa, where soil depletion has led to lower levels of iodine in crops.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI calculates body weight relative to height, but it doesn't differentiate between muscle mass and fat mass. This means that individuals with high muscle mass may be classified as overweight or obese when they are actually healthy. Therefore, the major limitation of using BMI is its inability to distinguish between fat and lean body mass.",C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI has several limitations as a body fat measurement method. It is not accurate for the average person, it is less accurate than traditional height-weight tables, and it fails to differentiate between fat mass and fat-free mass. Therefore, all of these points are valid concerns.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The brain, despite its small mass relative to the body, has a high energy expenditure due to its constant activity and maintenance of ion gradients for neuronal function. In contrast, skeletal muscle can vary in energy usage depending on physical activity levels but generally has lower baseline metabolic rates when at rest compared to organs like the brain or liver. The kidney also has a relatively high metabolic rate due to its role in filtering blood and maintaining homeostasis, while the liver is one of the most metabolically active organs involved in various biochemical processes. Therefore, skeletal muscle typically has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass when at rest.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The kidney plays a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, which is an energy-intensive process, so it must have a high energy expenditure per unit mass. The liver has various metabolic functions and also requires significant energy. The brain consumes about 20% of total body oxygen consumption despite making up only 2% of body weight, indicating high energy use per unit mass. Skeletal muscle can vary in its energy expenditure depending on activity level but generally has lower metabolic rates at rest compared to the other organs listed.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Randomisation is a key feature of controlled trials that helps ensure comparability between intervention groups, reducing bias from confounding factors. By randomly assigning participants, we increase the likelihood that both known and unknown characteristics are evenly distributed across groups, which strengthens causal inference.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that participants are volunteers implies a higher level of engagement and adherence to the study protocol, leading to more reliable data and stronger evidence for the intervention's effect. This is because motivated individuals are less likely to drop out or deviate from the assigned exposure.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Metformin is considered the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes due to its effectiveness in lowering blood glucose levels, improving insulin sensitivity, and having a favorable safety profile. Additionally, it has been shown to have beneficial effects on weight management, making it suitable for patients with obesity as well.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfonylureas effectively stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas, directly addressing the issue of high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, making them a logical first-line choice. However, Metformin is often preferred as it not only improves glycemic control but also has beneficial effects on weight and cardiovascular risk factors.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Animal proteins are generally more easily digested and absorbed than plant proteins due to their amino acid composition and the presence of fewer anti-nutritional factors in animal sources. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Digestibility refers to the proportion of nutrients absorbed by the body, which can be accurately measured by analyzing the content of faeces, hence the statement about faecal digestibility being correct. The other options are incorrect as plant proteins generally have lower digestibility compared to animal proteins (A), and meat protein is usually more digestible than plant proteins (B). Digestibility can be measured at different points in the gastrointestinal tract, not just the terminal ileum (C).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural rubber latex allergy is known to cross-react with certain food allergens due to similar protein structures, a phenomenon called the Latex-Fruit Syndrome. Among the options given, avocado and banana are commonly associated with this syndrome. Therefore, individuals suffering from natural latex allergy might not react to figs as they do not typically cross-react.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Avocados are known to cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and since cross-reactivity is common in allergies, it's likely that someone with a latex allergy would also react to avocados. Mangoes, peaches, and figs have been reported to show cross-reactivity with natural rubber latex as well.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, not just the colon. It may cause complications such as intestinal obstruction due to swelling and scar tissue formation. Surgical treatment is usually considered when medical therapy fails or in cases of severe complications. A gluten-free diet is primarily associated with celiac disease, not Crohn's disease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that often involves severe complications, and surgery is typically the most effective way to manage these complications and improve quality of life. Although it can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, not always the colon; intestinal obstruction may occur but isn't a defining characteristic; and while dietary changes are often recommended for symptom management, there is no specific requirement for a gluten-free diet.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2007-2008 food price spike had multiple contributing factors, including long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, increased use of food crops for biofuel production leading to reduced supply in the market, and commodity price speculation which drove prices up further. Therefore, all these reasons collectively contributed to the crisis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The increasing demand for biofuels led to a significant diversion of food crops for fuel production, directly reducing food supply and driving up prices, making it the primary cause of the food-price spike. While neglect of agricultural development and commodity speculation also played roles in exacerbating the situation, they were not as direct or immediate as biofuel demand.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Older adults often have lower caloric needs due to decreased physical activity and metabolism, but their nutrient requirements remain high or even increase. Therefore, a diet that is rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients without excessive energy content would be most beneficial for maintaining optimal health.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their metabolism slows down, requiring a higher intake of energy to maintain bodily functions and prevent malnutrition, hence the recommendation for a high-energy diet. However, older adults also need nutrient-dense foods due to decreased appetite and potential difficulty in absorbing certain nutrients.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a known risk factor for various types of cancer, including lung cancer. It can lead to chronic inflammation and hormonal imbalances that may contribute to the development of cancer cells in the lungs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is a known carcinogen and is linked to several types of cancer, including lung cancer, making it a significant risk factor for the disease. The other options (A: Saturated fat, B: Obesity, C: High dose \u00df-carotene supplements) are not as directly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In epidemiology, 'population at risk' refers to those individuals who are susceptible to a particular health outcome or disease under study. It does not necessarily involve risky behaviors, participation in harmful studies, or the group with the highest relative risk of disease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In an epidemiological context, the population at risk refers to the group of people participating in a study who may be exposed to potential harm or adverse effects due to the intervention being investigated. This definition aligns with option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of \u00df-carotene to retinol is not a 1:1 process, as one molecule of \u00df-carotene can produce two molecules of retinol. Therefore, the closest amount would be that for every mole of \u00df-carotene, there are approximately 2 moles of retinol formed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. β-carotene is a precursor to retinol, and their molecular structures are closely related, suggesting a direct conversion of one molecule of β-carotene to one molecule of retinol. However, the actual bioconversion rate from β-carotene to retinol in humans is not a 1:1 ratio but rather approximately 0.15 moles of retinol per mole of β-carotene.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption and bone health. A deficiency can lead to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which stimulates the conversion of vitamin D into its active form and increases the activity of alkaline phosphatase for bone resorption.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, which is essential for blood clotting. Therefore, a deficiency would lead to an increase in preprothrombin, a precursor to prothrombin, as the body attempts to compensate for impaired clotting. The correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is sensitive to heat, light, and oxygen exposure. In the context of canning, high levels of oxygen would actually accelerate the degradation of vitamin C rather than preserving it. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. Reheating food generally leads to further loss of nutrients like vitamin C, making statement B unlikely. Statement D suggests that losses are small during storage at ambient temperature; however, without specific conditions such as vacuum sealing and absence of light, this might not be accurate for all canned foods. Comparatively, statement C is more plausible because the processing methods for fruits often involve higher temperatures than those used for vegetables, which could lead to greater losses of vitamin C in fruit.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is sensitive to oxidation, so maintaining a high level of oxygen in the headspace of canned food helps prevent its degradation and preserve its nutritional value. Therefore, option A correctly states that keeping the amount of oxygen available at a high level limits losses of vitamin C.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis is a process where proteins are broken down into smaller polypeptides or amino acids, and it involves tagging of proteins with ubiquitin for degradation via the proteasome system. This indicates that not all tissue proteins undergo catabolism at the same rate (eliminating B), nor is lysosomal enzymes the only mechanism involved in protein catabolism (eliminating D). The rate of tissue protein catabolism can vary depending on factors such as nutritional status and hormonal signals, so it's not constant throughout the day (eliminating A). Therefore, the correct statement is that all proteins to be catabolized are tagged with ubiquitin.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids, and this process occurs at a constant rate for all tissue proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway tags proteins with ubiquitin for degradation, but not all catabolized proteins undergo this tagging. Lysosomal enzymes are involved in protein breakdown, but they're not the only mechanism.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for healthy teeth development and maintenance. A deficiency can lead to enamel defects and an increased risk of dental caries due to weakened tooth structure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining the health of connective tissues, including dental enamel. Therefore, a deficiency could lead to enamel defects and increased susceptibility to dental caries. The correct answer is vitamin C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble vitamins. Among these, research has shown that supplementation with Vitamin D can help reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure and inflammation. Additionally, some studies suggest that Vitamin E may also have a protective effect on the heart by preventing oxidative stress. Therefore, the combination of Vitamins D and E has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins A and D are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining healthy bones and the immune system. Their overall health-promoting effects likely contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, supplementation with these vitamins may help reduce such risks.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they typically experience a decrease in lean body mass and bone density due to changes in metabolism and hormonal levels. Additionally, the immune system tends to weaken with age, leading to impaired function. However, an increased appetite is not commonly associated with aging; in fact, many older adults experience a decrease in appetite.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As the immune system weakens with age, the body becomes more susceptible to infections, which can lead to increased energy expenditure and a subsequent increase in appetite to compensate for the energy loss. However, lean body mass, bone density, and immune function all tend to decrease as we age.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the difference between nitrogen intake and loss in an organism. Positive nitrogen balance occurs when intake exceeds excretion, indicating growth or tissue repair. Negative nitrogen balance happens when excretion surpasses intake, suggesting protein breakdown or malnutrition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the state where the intake of nitrogenous compounds equals the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites, indicating a steady state in protein metabolism. Positive nitrogen balance occurs when dietary intake exceeds excretion, typically seen during growth or recovery from illness. Negative nitrogen balance indicates that excretion is greater than intake, often observed during malnutrition or disease states.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells lack mitochondria, which are required for aerobic respiration processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, red blood cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway to generate ATP from glucose metabolism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which binds oxygen, providing the necessary conditions for aerobic glycolysis to occur, allowing them to efficiently produce energy. The other options are incorrect: not all reactions of glycolysis are freely reversible (A), fructose can be used in gluconeogenesis (B), and red blood cells lack mitochondria for aerobic respiration.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. It is normal for newborns to lose some weight after birth, but significant concerns arise when the weight loss exceeds a certain threshold or if the baby does not start gaining weight within an expected timeframe. According to medical guidelines, losing more than 10% of their birth weight or failing to regain it by day 14 are signs that warrant attention.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Newborns typically lose some weight after birth due to fluid loss and adjustments to feeding. However, if they haven't regained their birth weight by day 7, it could indicate an underlying issue and warrant concern. Additionally, a weight loss of more than 10% is also considered significant. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is when the newborn has lost more than 10% of their birth weight or hasn't regained it by day 14.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Assessing growth in routine practice involves monitoring multiple parameters to get a comprehensive understanding of an individual's development. Height, weight, and head circumference are all important indicators of growth and overall health. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is assessing both weight and height.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Growth is primarily about getting taller, so monitoring height is the most important factor in assessing growth. However, weight also plays a significant role as it indicates overall health and nutritional status. Therefore, both height and weight should be assessed to get a comprehensive understanding of an individual's growth.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mucous cells are responsible for secreting mucus to protect the stomach lining, chief cells produce pepsinogen which is converted into pepsin in an acidic environment, parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, while G cells secrete gastrin. Therefore, the correct statement about these cells is that mucous cells secrete the glycoprotein mucin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. G cells are directly responsible for producing and releasing hydrochloric acid, which is crucial for digestion. Mucous cells produce mucin to protect the stomach lining from its own acidity. Chief cells secrete pepsinogen, an inactive enzyme precursor that gets activated into pepsin by gastric acid. Parietal cells are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, not chief cells.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. DNMT1 is the enzyme responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns during replication, ensuring that methylation marks are copied from the parental to the daughter strand of DNA.",A,"Let's reason step by step. DNMT3L is known to be involved in establishing methylation patterns, so it's likely responsible for copying these marks during replication. However, the enzyme specifically tasked with maintaining DNA methylation patterns after cell division and ensuring that the daughter strand receives the same methylation pattern as the parental strand is DNMT1.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A Low-Calorie Diet (LCD) typically restricts calories to a certain level, while a Very Low-Calorie Diet (VLCD) is more extreme in reducing daily caloric intake and often uses meal replacements instead of natural foods.",A,"Let's reason step by step. VLCDs are more restrictive, so they likely provide less energy and focus on processed supplements rather than natural foods. Therefore, the correct answer is that a VLCD provides less energy than an LCD and usually does not include natural foods.",A
