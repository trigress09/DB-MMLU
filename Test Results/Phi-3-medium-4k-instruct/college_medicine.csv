A,"Let's reason step by step. Codons are specific sequences that encode for amino acids during protein synthesis, and they consist of three nucleotide bases. These codons can be found on mRNA or tRNA molecules but not in polypeptides or deoxyribose sugars. Therefore, the correct answer is a triplet sequence of nucleotide bases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that adenine and thymine bind with two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine and guanine bind with three. So it makes sense that codons are composed of quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases. However, this is not the case as we have established before. Codons are actually triplets of nucleotides in mRNA or DNA that code for a specific amino acid during protein synthesis.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint activities, peripheral muscle fatigue is often attributed to metabolic changes within the muscles. An accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) occurs due to ATP breakdown and can impair muscle contraction by reducing the sensitivity of contractile proteins to calcium ions. This leads to a decrease in force generation, contributing to fatigue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A lack of potassium can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced during multiple sprint activities. Potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining proper muscle function, including contraction and relaxation processes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a lack of potassium.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The article mentions that during sauna use, the body loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat and there is an increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This indicates a significant loss of fluids from the body. Therefore, it would be important for a person to replenish these lost fluids after sauna use.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sauna use depletes the body's energy stores, so it would be important to eat a meal to replenish those stores and restore homeostasis. Additionally, sauna bathing induces sweating which leads to fluid loss; therefore, drinking water is crucial for hydration afterward.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA polymerase synthesizes a new strand of DNA complementary to the template strand, meaning A pairs with T and vice versa. If the original template has an A:T ratio of 3:2, then in the newly synthesized strand, there will be a corresponding number of Ts for As from the template (3) and As for Ts (2), maintaining the same ratio.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T, then the newly synthesized strand will also have a 3:2 ratio of A:T because they are complementary. For every adenine (A) in the template strand, there is thymine (T) added to the new strand and vice versa.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. ADH, Cortisol and Aldosterone are hormones that help the body retain water and maintain electrolyte balance during dehydration or starvation. Insulin is a hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose levels. In cases of severe dehydration and starvation, insulin secretion would be reduced due to low glucose availability.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aldosterone helps the body retain sodium, which is important for maintaining blood volume and blood pressure. In a state of dehydration and starvation, the body would need to conserve fluids, so aldosterone levels would be elevated. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) also helps retain water in the body, which would likely be increased during severe dehydration. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can increase with starvation and dehydration as part of the body's response to stress. Insulin levels are typically lowered when fasting or not consuming food because insulin regulates blood glucose levels, which would be low during starvation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant is a substance that reduces surface tension within the alveoli, preventing their collapse and maintaining them in an open state for efficient gas exchange. This allows oxygen to diffuse across the alveolar membranes more effectively.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant likely increases the permeability of the alveolar membrane, allowing for easier diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. However, its primary role is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli, preventing their collapse and maintaining them in an open state which facilitates gas exchange.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ability to tolerate heavy training, tactics, and diet are all well-known factors that influence success in sports. However, ingestion of carnitine during exercise is not a universally recognized factor for sporting success; while it may have some benefits related to energy metabolism, its direct impact on overall performance varies among individuals.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tactics are not as important as physical training, mental preparation, and a healthy diet for achieving success in sport. While ingestion of certain supplements like carnitine may have some impact on performance, it is not considered a primary factor influencing overall success.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of one glucose molecule to two pyruvate molecules occurs during glycolysis, which results in a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules per glucose. Therefore, the correct answer is that this process leads to the formation of two molecules of ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and water molecules are produced as a byproduct. So, the net formation would be six molecules of water. However, ATP production also occurs during this process. For each glucose molecule, two ATPs are used in the initial steps, but four ATPs are generated later on, resulting in a net gain of two ATPs.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the principle of continuity, which states that the product of cross-sectional area and velocity remains constant in a fluid flow (A1V1 = A2V2), if the nozzle end has 1/3 the area of the start of the hose, then the final velocity must be three times the initial velocity to maintain this relationship. Therefore, with an initial velocity of 2 m/s, the final velocity would be 6 m/s.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pressure of the water is kept constant, the velocity of the water should also remain constant as it exits the nozzle. The change in area does not affect the speed at which the water leaves the hose.",A

Testosterone is a primary anabolic steroid, known for its role in building muscle mass and increasing physical performance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Progesterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in muscle development and growth, making it a likely basis for performance-enhancing steroids. Testosterone also has similar effects but synthetic anabolic steroids are primarily based on the structure of progesterone.",C

Prejudice involves holding negative attitudes towards individuals solely because of their membership in a particular group.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The spectator is judging all welfare recipients based on a negative stereotype, which is a characteristic of ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism involves evaluating other groups according to the standards and customs of one's own culture or group.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gold (Au) has an atomic number of 79, meaning it has 79 electrons in its neutral state. The quantum number l = 2 corresponds to the d-orbital. In gold's electron configuration ([Xe]4f^145d^106s^1), there are 10 electrons in the 5d orbital (l=2). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gold is in the d-block of the periodic table and has one electron in its outermost s orbital and ten electrons in its d orbitals, so it should have 1 + 10 = 11 electrons with l = 2.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario described is akin to an attachment style assessment, where securely attached children typically explore when their caregiver is present and seek comfort upon reunion after separation. A concerning sign would be the child avoiding the mother upon her return, as it may indicate insecure or disorganized attachment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Crying and returning to the mother upon her return is a normal and healthy response that demonstrates a secure attachment between the child and the mother. Decreased exploration when the mother is out of the room may indicate some level of anxiety, but it can also be typical behavior for young children in unfamiliar situations. Exploring the room before the mother leaves shows curiosity and confidence. However, avoiding the mother upon her return could suggest an insecure attachment or a problematic home situation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The article discusses the benefits of sauna use, including reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death and dementia, improved mental health, and increased plasma volume to mitigate decreases in core blood volume. However, it does not mention any effect on stroke volume; instead, it states that heart rate increases while stroke volume remains unchanged during sauna use.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The article highlights the numerous health benefits of sauna use, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of dementia. It's likely that these benefits extend to mental health conditions as well, such as anxiety and depression. However, there is no mention in the text about a decreased rate of erectile dysfunction being one of the benefits associated with sauna use.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong acids are characterized by their ability to completely dissociate into ions when dissolved in water, resulting in a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). This property leads to stable conjugate bases after the acid has donated its proton. Therefore, among the given options, having stable conjugate bases is most characteristic of strong acids.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong acids are those that do not fully dissociate in water, meaning their Ka value is less than 1. This indicates a high degree of ionization and strong acidity.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inner membrane of the mitochondrion is where oxidative phosphorylation occurs, which includes the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis. Therefore, it contains components necessary for these processes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mitochondria are responsible for energy production, and glycogen is a stored form of glucose, so it makes sense that glycogen molecules would be embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. This allows for quick access to glucose when needed for ATP production.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. An action potential arriving at the motor endplate triggers the release of a neurotransmitter, not ions or hormones directly involved in initiating an action potential along the muscle fiber. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter released at neuromuscular junctions to transmit signals from nerve cells to muscles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in increasing metabolic activity, so it's likely released at the motor endplate to stimulate muscle activity. Acetylcholine is indeed involved in neuromuscular junction transmission but not directly causing an action potential along the muscle fiber.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Osmosis is a specific type of passive transport that involves the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration, driven solely by the gradient of water molecules.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Endocytosis involves the movement of materials into the cell through the formation of vesicles, which is driven by the concentration gradient of the material outside the cell. This process does not require energy and relies solely on the difference in concentrations to control the direction of movement across the membrane.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. SDS is a detergent used in SDS-PAGE to denature proteins and impart them with a uniform negative charge proportional to their length, allowing separation based solely on molecular weight during electrophoresis. The correct answer should reflect this purpose.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The SDS detergent helps to prevent the protein from denaturing during electrophoresis, ensuring that the separation is based on the protein's true tertiary structure. It also imparts a uniform negative charge across all proteins, allowing them to be separated solely based on size.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The article discusses the benefits of sauna use, particularly in relation to cardiovascular health and overall well-being. It mentions that repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes its response to future exposures, similar to moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise. This suggests that individuals who are unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or physical limitations may still benefit from sauna use as an alternative form of stress on the body.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The article mentions the numerous health benefits of sauna use, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of dementia. It's likely that sauna use could also have therapeutic effects on skin conditions. However, it doesn't mention anything about diet or salt restriction specifically benefiting from sauna use. The closest statement to the information provided in the article is option D: 'Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The shape of the meniscus is determined by the balance between cohesive and adhesive forces in a liquid. Mercury forms a convex meniscus because its cohesive forces (attraction among mercury atoms) are stronger than its adhesive forces (attraction to the cylinder walls), causing it to pull together rather than spread out. On the other hand, water has strong adhesive forces with the glass, which causes it to climb up the sides of the cylinder and form a concave meniscus.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The shape of the meniscus depends on the interaction between the liquid and the material of the graduated cylinder. Since water forms a concave meniscus, it must have a stronger attraction to the cylinder walls than mercury does. This indicates that adhesive forces are dominant for water while cohesive forces dominate in mercury.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose transport into muscle cells is facilitated by a specific protein called GLUT4, which responds to insulin signaling for glucose uptake. While hexokinase phosphorylates glucose once it enters the cell and monocarboxylic acid transporters are involved in different processes, they do not directly transport glucose into muscle cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose enters the muscle cell and is immediately acted upon by the enzyme hexokinase, which facilitates its transport across the cell membrane. However, for glucose to be continuously supplied into the muscle cells in response to insulin signaling, it requires specific protein transporters called GLUT4.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. McDonaldization refers to the process where society adopts characteristics of a fast-food restaurant, such as efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control through non-human technologies. Options A, B, and D align with these principles. However, C suggests a shift towards collaborative decision protocols which contradicts the impersonal nature of McDonaldization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. McDonaldization is all about creating efficient systems with clear divisions of labor and established protocols. This aligns perfectly with the characteristics of a bureaucratic organization. However, it does not necessarily dissolve hierarchical authority into collaborative team-based decision protocols; instead, it often reinforces hierarchy through standardized procedures.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training primarily targets the aerobic system, enhancing the muscles' ability to utilize oxygen for prolonged periods of activity. This adaptation leads to improved fat and carbohydrate metabolism during exercise, allowing athletes to sustain effort over longer durations without relying heavily on anaerobic energy sources.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training focuses on improving the muscle's ability to sustain activity over long periods. This involves enhancing the breakdown of phosphocreatine, which is a key energy source for short bursts of power. However, endurance training primarily increases the efficiency in burning fat and carbohydrates as fuel sources during prolonged exercise.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increase, the body relies more on anaerobic energy systems due to the high intensity and short duration of each sprint. This leads to a progressive accumulation of lactate in muscles, causing the pH to drop but not necessarily below 6.0. Blood glucose concentration may decrease as well, but it's unlikely to fall below 3 mmol/L solely due to increased sprinting. The relative contribution of aerobic metabolism does not increase with more sprints; instead, the anaerobic system becomes more dominant.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increases, the body's glucose stores become depleted, leading to a significant drop in blood glucose concentration below the critical level of 3 mmol/L. This is because high-intensity exercises like sprinting rely heavily on anaerobic metabolism and glycogen stores for energy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid is a 16-carbon fatty acid, and during \u03b2-oxidation, it undergoes successive cycles of oxidation that cleave off two carbon units in the form of acetyl-CoA until the entire chain is converted into acetyl-CoA molecules. Since palmitic acid has 16 carbons, \u03b2-oxidation will yield 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA (16/2).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid has 16 carbons in its chain. During beta-oxidation, each carbon is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule. Therefore, the complete oxidation of palmitic acid should yield 16 molecules of acetyl-CoA. The other options either do not account for all carbons or incorrectly describe the process.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen is not used in glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require oxygen. The conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA also doesn't directly involve oxygen. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose and does not use oxygen either. However, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle), which occurs in the mitochondria, uses oxygen indirectly as it requires NAD+ and FAD that are regenerated during oxidative phosphorylation where oxygen is the final electron acceptor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogenolysis is the process of breaking down glycogen into glucose. This process requires oxygen to proceed efficiently, similar to how cellular respiration needs oxygen for ATP production. Therefore, among the given options, oxygen usage in glycogenolysis makes the most sense.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Tyler is a high-performing student aiming for engineering, so he likely has good problem-solving skills.

Option D shows that Tyler critically analyzes his study methods to identify weaknesses and improve them, which is a proactive approach.",D,"Let's reason step by step. By expressing concern about the teacher's grading and potential bias, Tyler demonstrates a willingness to seek external feedback and identify areas for improvement. This approach shows self-awareness and a proactive attitude towards addressing his weaknesses.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. After translation, proteins can undergo various modifications to become functional. Lipidation and glycosylation are post-translational modifications that involve adding lipid or sugar groups respectively. Phosphorylation involves the addition of phosphate groups. However, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds occurs during translation, not after.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that involves changing the protein's structure by adding sugar molecules, which can affect its folding and function. Phosphorylation also modifies proteins after translation by adding phosphate groups to specific amino acids, altering their activity or interactions. Lipidation is another post-translational modification where lipid molecules are added to a protein, influencing membrane association and signaling. However, the attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds occurs during translation itself, not afterward.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. During one complete turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, two molecules of CO2 are produced as a result of decarboxylation reactions. Additionally, for each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, 1 ATP (or GTP) is generated through substrate-level phosphorylation. Since one glucose molecule generates two acetyl-CoA molecules entering the Krebs' cycle, a total of 2 CO2 and 2 ATP are produced per glucose molecule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Krebs cycle generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and also produces NADH and FADH2, which contribute to ATP production in the electron transport chain. Considering all ATP generated, one complete cycle should yield around 16 ATP molecules. However, directly from the Krebs cycle itself, only 1 ATP (or GTP) is produced per turn.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Metabolism is a set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms, and it is primarily determined by enzymes which are proteins encoded by genetic material (DNA). These enzymes catalyze metabolic processes that convert nutrients into energy and building blocks for the cell. Therefore, the correct answer relates to the role of genetic material in dictating protein formation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metabolism encompasses all the chemical reactions within a cell. Since proteins are the main catalysts for these reactions, the size of the proteins present would directly influence the overall metabolic rate. The availability of amino acids and genetic material dictate protein synthesis but do not solely determine metabolism. Amino acid composition in RNA is related to gene expression rather than metabolism itself.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate and hydrogen ions are produced during muscle metabolism, especially under anaerobic conditions. They need to be removed from the muscle cells to prevent acidification of the intracellular environment. These substances can diffuse across cell membranes due to their small size and charge properties without requiring energy or specific transport proteins.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, lactate and hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscle. Carnosine acts as a buffer, binding to these ions and transporting them out of the muscle to maintain pH balance. This process is facilitated through a cotransport mechanism involving carnosine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cystic Fibrosis affects the pancreas, leading to a deficiency in enzymes responsible for digestion and nutrient absorption. Lipase is crucial for fat digestion; without it, patients would experience significant malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). This would have the most extensive effects on overall nutrition compared to deficiencies in other enzymes listed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carboxypeptidase plays a crucial role in the final stages of protein digestion, ensuring complete breakdown of peptides into individual amino acids for absorption. Its deficiency would significantly impair nutrient uptake. Lipase is important for fat digestion but not as critical as carboxypeptidase for overall nutrient absorption. Elastinogen and trypsinogen are involved in other processes, making them less impactful on nutrient absorption compared to carboxypeptidase.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates glucose levels in the bloodstream and promotes the uptake of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells for energy production and protein synthesis. Adrenaline, glycogen, and cortisol have different roles related to stress response and metabolism but do not directly promote glucose and amino acid uptake by muscles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline is released during stress or exercise, preparing the body for action. It stimulates the breakdown of glycogen and release of glucose into the bloodstream, making it readily available for muscle uptake. Insulin promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by cells, including muscle cells, to be used as energy or stored. Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in the liver and muscles but does not promote uptake itself. Cortisol increases blood sugar levels through gluconeogenesis and has catabolic effects on protein tissues. Therefore, insulin is the hormone that promotes glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nietzsche's Will to Truth refers to the philosophical concept where individuals have an inherent drive or instinct to seek and discover truth, regardless of its implications on their belief systems or societal norms. This idea is central to his critique of traditional morality and metaphysics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nietzsche's Will to Truth is deeply rooted in our subconscious desires and motivations. It can be considered a part of our ego, driving us to seek knowledge and understanding of the world. This concept does not directly relate to morality or love but rather focuses on our inherent drive for truth.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The hormone is found both inside and outside cells, increases nucleic acids in the cell, and has a structure with four hydroxycarbon rings. These characteristics match those of steroid hormones, which are lipid-soluble (allowing them to enter cells), can affect gene expression by increasing nucleic acid levels, and have a core structure consisting of four interconnected carbon rings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hormone's ability to increase nucleic acid suggests it plays a role in regulating gene expression or DNA replication. This is a typical characteristic of enzymatic hormones, which often act as catalysts in cellular processes. However, the key information here is that the hormone is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings, which indicates it's a steroid hormone. Steroid hormones are known to be lipid-soluble and can enter cells easily, aligning with the description of being found both inside and outside cells.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that individuals are less likely to offer help in an emergency situation when there are others present, as responsibility is diffused among those witnesses. In this scenario, having another person already approaching the girl (D) would most directly impact the pedestrian's reaction according to the bystander effect, as it introduces a specific other individual into the scene and may influence whether or not they choose to render aid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that the presence of other people diffuses responsibility, making individuals less likely to intervene. Therefore, knowing there's another group nearby would likely reduce the pedestrian's willingness to help. Answer B is correct because it directly relates to the number of potential helpers present.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are a class of compounds that selectively bind to androgen receptors, mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones like testosterone but with fewer side effects. They are not traditional steroid drugs; instead, they offer targeted action on specific tissues without affecting others as much.",C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are designed to target specific androgen receptors, but unlike traditional steroids, they block the effects of natural hormones, leading to a more controlled and targeted response. Therefore, they act as antagonists rather than mimicking or enhancing the effects of natural steroid hormones.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinase reactions are enzymatic processes that specifically involve the transfer of phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific substrates. This process is crucial for various cellular functions including signal transduction and metabolism regulation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinases are essential enzymes that regulate cellular energy by preventing the breakdown of ATP, ensuring a sufficient supply of energy for various cellular processes.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The reaction described is an elimination reaction, specifically E2 mechanism where 2-bromobutane reacts with ethanol to form alkenes. In this case, the major product (2-butene) results from the removal of a hydrogen atom and bromine on adjacent carbons in the starting compound. The most likely reason for 2-butene being the major product is that it forms more stable alkene due to greater hyperconjugation compared to 1-butene, which doesn't involve rearrangement or a preference of ethanol.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ethanol, as a nucleophile, has a preference for attacking the second carbon in a chain due to steric hindrance at the first carbon. This explains why 2-butene is the major product in this reaction. The other options do not accurately describe the mechanism of the reaction.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, muscle cells require energy in the form of glucose. Glycogen stored within the muscles is broken down to release glucose when needed for energy production. This process is primarily activated by an increase in intracellular calcium levels and adrenaline (epinephrine), not insulin, cortisol, or pH changes. Therefore, none of the options listed directly trigger glycogen breakdown during exercise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is a hormone released during stress, and in stressful situations like exercise, the body needs to break down glycogen for energy. Insulin promotes glucose uptake and storage as glycogen, not its breakdown. Increased pH does not directly activate glycogen breakdown. Therefore, none of the options provided are correct.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Semi-periphery countries are those that have aspects of both core and periphery countries, often acting as a buffer between them. They typically have more diversified economies than periphery countries but less developed than core countries. Therefore, the best answer is a diversified and developed economy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Semi-periphery countries are typically still developing, and many developing nations have economies heavily reliant on a single resource like oil or minerals. This characteristic aligns with the description of an economy centralized around one natural resource.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law (PV=nRT), where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is the gas constant and T is temperature in Kelvin; increasing the temperature or the number of moles of gas will increase the pressure if all other variables are held constant. Therefore, option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law, pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. So, decreasing both temperature and volume would increase the pressure. However, we are looking for two variables that will both increase the pressure when all other variables are held constant.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is indeed produced during intense exercise due to amino acid catabolism (A). Muscle phosphocreatine depletion occurs rapidly within the first few seconds of high-intensity exercise, making statement C true. However, muscle lactate accumulation can begin much sooner than 5 seconds into intermittent contractions, as it starts when anaerobic glycolysis exceeds aerobic metabolism (B). Statement D is false because with repeated sprints, the rate of lactate accumulation typically increases due to insufficient recovery time for clearance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which produces ammonia as a byproduct. Muscle phosphocreatine is indeed depleted in the first few seconds of intense activity to provide energy quickly. However, muscle lactate accumulation can begin almost immediately during high-intensity exercise and does not require at least 5 seconds of contractions. Therefore, statement B is false.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. The typical creatine loading protocol involves taking a higher dose for 5-7 days to quickly saturate the muscles, followed by a maintenance phase with a lower daily intake. A common recommendation is to consume around 0.3 g/kg body weight per day during the loading phase. For a 70 kg man, this would be approximately 21 grams per day (70 kg * 0.3 g/kg). However, since none of the options match exactly and considering practical dosing guidelines, option D is closest to the recommended dose.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is naturally produced in the body, so a small daily supplement of 5g should be enough to load the muscles within a week. Higher doses may not provide additional benefits and could potentially cause side effects.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The gustatory system (taste) is based on chemical receptors that detect dissolved substances, while the olfactory system (smell) involves chemoreceptors in the nose responding to airborne molecules. Both are chemically-based sensory systems. On the other hand, the auditory system (hearing) relies on mechanical vibrations rather than chemical interactions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The gustatory system, responsible for taste, directly interacts with chemicals in food to produce sensations, making it a chemically based system. The auditory system relies on mechanical vibrations and is not primarily chemically based.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Sensory or neural adaptation refers to a decrease in sensitivity to a constant stimulus over time. Options A, B, and D describe situations where you become less aware of continuous stimuli (fabric on your back, buzz of conversation, smell of formaldehyde). However, option C describes an immediate adjustment to brightness rather than a decrease in sensitivity over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sensory adaptation occurs when our senses become less responsive to a constant stimulus, like the buzz of conversation in a crowded room, allowing us to focus on more important information. However, option A refers to tactile desensitization rather than neural adaptation since it involves physical contact with clothing and not a change in perception due to continuous exposure.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, balance the chemical equation: C2H4 + 3O2 \u2014> 2CO2 + 2H2O. Next, calculate moles of ethane (C2H4) using its molecular weight (2*12amu for carbon + 4*1amu for hydrogen = 28g/mol). Moles of C2H4 = 84g / 28g/mol = 3 moles. According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of ethane produces 2 moles of CO2. Therefore, 3 moles of ethane will produce 6 moles of CO2. Finally, calculate grams of CO2 using its molecular weight (1*12amu for carbon + 2*16amu for oxygen = 44g/mol). Grams of CO2 = 6 moles * 44g/mol = 264g.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Based on the molecular weights and the reaction equation, 84g of ethane should produce roughly 156g of carbon dioxide. The balanced chemical equation is C2H6 + 7/2 O2 -> 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. Since one molecule of ethane (C2H6) produces two molecules of CO2, and the molar mass of ethane is approximately 30g/mol while that of carbon dioxide is about 44g/mol, we can calculate the expected yield: (84g C2H6 / 30g/mol) * (2 mol CO2 * 44g/mol) = approximately 156g CO2.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers, also known as Type II muscle fibers, are designed for quick bursts of power and speed but fatigue quickly. They rely more on anaerobic metabolism than aerobic metabolism, which means they have fewer mitochondria compared to slow-twitch (Type I) fibers that require a lot of oxygen and energy over long periods. Fast-twitch fibers also exhibit high ATPase activity for rapid contraction but do not rely on the large number of mitochondria as much.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers are used for quick bursts of energy, so they don't require a lot of mitochondria and have low ATPase activity. This is because their primary function is to generate power quickly rather than sustain long periods of contraction like slow-twitch fibers.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation between students having overlapping social networks with alumni and admission acceptance (+0.61) suggests that connections within the college community play a significant role in admissions decisions, beyond academic performance (GPA and test scores). This indicates the importance of relationships and networking, which is referred to as 'social capital'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The strong correlation between academic achievements and admission acceptance indicates that the selection process is based on merit and academic performance. However, the even stronger correlation of +0.61 between students' social networks overlapping with alumni networks suggests an additional factor influencing admissions decisions beyond just grades and test scores. This highlights the importance of connections or relationships in gaining admission to selective colleges.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Symbolic culture involves the transmission of knowledge through symbols, language, or rituals that are not directly related to survival instincts but rather learned behavior within a society. In option I, macaques learning from each other is an example of social learning but does not involve symbolic elements like language or ritualistic behaviors. Option II involves the transmission of knowledge through language and rules, which fits into symbolic culture. Option III also represents symbolic culture as it includes rituals passed down within a group.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hazing rituals serve as a way to transmit cultural knowledge and traditions from older members to new recruits in a military organization. This is an example of symbolic culture transmission (III). A child learning the rules of baseball from a parent also represents the transmission of symbolic culture, as it involves passing down societal norms and practices through generations (II). However, a young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food in the ocean does not involve symbols or abstract concepts but rather direct observation and imitation. Therefore, this is an example of non-symbolic cultural transmission.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA). This occurs within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells where the DNA resides. Ribosomes are involved in translation, not transcription, and cell division does not dictate when transcription happens.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Transcription involves copying genetic information from DNA to RNA, a process necessary for cell division and replication. This occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells where the DNA is located.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The improvement of world record performances is likely due to increased participation and accessibility, rather than biological evolution or inherent speed capabilities compared to men. Starting training at an earlier age could contribute to performance improvements but does not explain the rapid advancement seen across various sports disciplines.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Over time, women have evolved to have greater muscle mass and athletic capabilities, leading to significant improvements in their performance. However, the rapid improvement in recent years is more likely due to increased participation of women in sports at all levels, including professional competitions. This has led to better training methods, resources, and opportunities for female athletes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The officer's unconscious bias, influenced by his past experiences with his father, is affecting his decision-making process without him being aware of it. This scenario aligns with the psychoanalytic framework, which focuses on how unconscious thoughts and feelings can influence behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps individuals identify and challenge their biased thoughts and behaviors, which could explain the officer's actions. This approach focuses on understanding how unconscious beliefs influence current behavior.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the case of a noncompetitive inhibitor, increasing substrate concentration does not affect its binding to the allosteric site and thus has no impact on enzyme activity. For uncompetitive inhibitors, they bind only when the enzyme-substrate complex is formed; therefore, an increase in substrate concentration would lead to more enzyme-substrate complexes available for the inhibitor to bind, increasing its effect.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing substrate concentration wouldn't affect the binding of either type of inhibitor, so there would be no change in their impact on enzyme activity. Noncompetitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site and uncompetitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme-substrate complex regardless of substrate concentration.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy yield from oxygen consumption can be estimated using the approximate value of 20.1 kJ per liter of oxygen consumed (a standard physiological conversion factor). Therefore, if a male athlete consumes 2 liters of oxygen per minute during training, his rate of energy expenditure would be approximately 2 * 20.1 = 40.2 kJ/min.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Each liter of oxygen consumed roughly corresponds to 20 kJ of energy expenditure, so the athlete would be expending around 200 kJ/min. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sex of a child is determined by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from both parents. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). A single Y chromosome, which carries genes responsible for male development, must come from the father to result in a male offspring.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sex-linked traits are determined by recessive alleles on the X chromosome, and since males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to express these traits. However, sex determination is not based on a single Y chromosome from either parent but rather the presence of a Y chromosome itself. The mother can only contribute an X chromosome, while it's the father who contributes either an X or a Y chromosome to determine the child's sex.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Signal Detection Theory, a 'miss' occurs when the signal is present but not detected by the observer. Since the pilot cannot see the light at 1 mile away despite it being there and set to test brightness, this situation represents a miss.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pilot correctly identified that there was no signal present, so this would be considered a correct rejection in Signal Detection Theory. However, the question asks for when the pilot cannot detect the light at 1 mile away, which means he failed to identify the presence of the signal (the tower's light). This scenario is classified as a 'Miss', where the signal was present but not detected.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The contact hypothesis suggests that increased interaction between groups can reduce prejudice, which aligns with the recommendation for paid community improvement projects open to people from different groups. Self-esteem hypothesis is not directly mentioned in the recommendations provided. Legal hypothesis seems relevant due to stricter anti-hate ordinances being recommended. However, there's no mention of a 'Hypothesis', making option III incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The legal hypothesis suggests that by implementing stricter anti-hate ordinances, individuals will feel more secure and valued, leading to increased self-esteem and willingness to interact with different groups. The contact hypothesis posits that increasing interactions between conflicting groups through community projects can reduce prejudice. There is no mention of a 'Hypothesis' or an explicit 'Self-esteem hypothesis,' but the legal measures could indirectly affect self-esteem by creating safer environments.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The son of a bricklayer moving from being a teacher at one medical school to becoming a tenured professor and then relocating for another position represents changes in his own social status (intragenerational mobility) rather than comparing it with the father's occupation (intergenerational mobility). Initially, he moves upward by gaining tenure. Then, moving across the country for a new job is considered horizontal mobility as there isn't an indication of increased or decreased status.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Moving across the country for a new tenured professor position signifies an upward mobility as it often involves a higher salary and greater prestige associated with the new institution. The son becoming a teacher at a medical school, then getting promoted to tenured professor represents horizontal mobility within his career field but does not necessarily indicate intergenerational or intragenerational mobility.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Bernoulli's principle, as blood flows from a higher point (neck) to a lower point (knee), the pressure head decreases due to gravitational potential energy conversion into kinetic energy. Therefore, the pressure in the knee capillary would be greater than that in the neck capillary.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bernoulli's principle primarily deals with ideal fluids, and blood, with its complex composition and properties, requires additional information like viscosity and density for accurate pressure comparisons. Therefore, without knowledge of the fluid's (blood) density and viscosity, an accurate comparison cannot be given.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase (ACE), rendering it permanently inactive, which indicates that DFP forms a stable complex with ACE and does not dissociate easily. This type of interaction is characteristic of irreversible inhibition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since DFP binds to the active site of ACE, it directly competes with the substrate for binding, preventing the enzyme from functioning, which is characteristic of competitive inhibition. However, the key detail here is that DFP renders ACE permanently inactive, indicating a long-lasting or irreversible effect on the enzyme's activity.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The teacher implemented two different reward systems: one for punctuality (fixed ratio) and another for quiz performance (also fixed ratio). Since the students showed significant improvement in quizzes but only slight decrease in tardiness, it suggests that they were more motivated to improve their academic performance than their punctuality. This indicates that intrinsic motivation played a larger role in driving behavior change related to quiz scores.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant improvement in quiz performance compared to the slight decrease in tardiness suggests that the students naturally prioritize academic success over punctuality. This indicates that their intrinsic motivation for doing well on quizzes is stronger than their motivation to arrive on time, making option B the most plausible explanation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power is the highest level of effort that an athlete can maintain over a prolonged period without fatigue. As distance increases, energy stores deplete and muscle fatigue sets in, causing a decline in performance. Therefore, it makes sense that the maximum sustainable power would decrease with longer distances.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest level of effort an athlete can maintain consistently throughout a race, therefore it should remain relatively constant. However, as distance increases, fatigue sets in and the ability to sustain high levels of power decreases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the maximum sustainable power declines with the distance of the race.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline secretion is part of the body's 'fight or flight' response, which is primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. During exercise, increased sympathetic nerve activity stimulates adrenal glands to release adrenaline into the bloodstream.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body utilizes fatty acids as a primary energy source, and the increase in plasma fatty acids triggers the adrenal glands to secrete adrenaline to further mobilize energy reserves. This process is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, which increases activity during exercise.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statements A, B, and C are true: muscle glycogen is indeed broken down to glucose-1-phosphate; elite endurance runners typically have more Type I fibers for sustained energy; liver glycogen helps maintain blood glucose levels. However, statement D is not entirely accurate because insulin promotes glucose uptake primarily in muscle and adipose tissue, but not all tissues (e.g., the brain relies on other mechanisms for glucose uptake).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Elite endurance runners primarily rely on explosive bursts of speed, which are facilitated by Type II muscle fibers, not Type I fibers known for their endurance capabilities. Muscle glycogen breakdown to glucose-1-phosphate (A), liver glycogen's role in blood glucose maintenance (C), and insulin promoting glucose uptake by tissues (D) are all true statements.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle fibers contract when a nerve stimulus causes the release of calcium ions, which then bind to troponin on the thin filaments (actin), moving tropomyosin away from actin binding sites and allowing myosin heads to attach and pull the actin filaments inward. Muscle relaxation occurs when the nerve stimulus is removed, leading to a decrease in calcium ion concentration, which allows tropomyosin to cover the actin binding sites again, preventing further cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When the nerve stimulus becomes too forceful, it can overload the muscle fibers, leading to a temporary relaxation to prevent damage. This is known as the 'overstimulation reflex'. The other options do not directly cause muscle fiber relaxation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the health benefits associated with sauna use, particularly focusing on studies conducted among Finnish populations where sauna usage is prevalent. These benefits include reduced risk of cardiovascular-related death and dementia, improved mental health, and increased heat tolerance due to hormesis. While these findings are significant, they do not directly correlate with any of the options provided except for option D: 'Improved marriage satisfaction rates'. It is plausible that better overall health and well-being resulting from regular sauna use could contribute to improved marital relationships in Finland compared to other countries. The remaining options (A, B, C) do not have a clear connection with the benefits of sauna usage discussed in the passage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The stress-reducing and health-promoting effects of sauna use likely contribute to improved communication and emotional connection between partners, leading to higher marriage satisfaction rates in Finland. This is more plausible than the other options because they are not directly related to the benefits of sauna bathing.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The hypothalamus releases Corticotropin-releasing Factor (CRF), which stimulates the release of cortisol, a stress hormone. This process is regulated through negative feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis. When cortisol levels rise in the bloodstream, it signals the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to reduce CRF production, thus suppressing further cortisol release.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As cortisol levels rise, the body triggers vasoconstriction of blood vessels supplying the adrenal gland, reducing its ability to produce more cortisol and thus suppressing the stress response. This mechanism is known as a negative feedback loop.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine resynthesis during recovery from exercise primarily relies on the availability of oxygen to facilitate aerobic metabolism and ATP production. A lack of oxygen would inhibit this process, as it is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation which occurs in mitochondria.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When oxygen is abundant, the body primarily relies on aerobic metabolism for energy production, which reduces the need for phosphocreatine resynthesis, thus inhibiting the process.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine are all amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. However, palmitic acid is a fatty acid, not an amino acid. Therefore, it does not belong to the same category.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamic acid, like palmitic acid, ends with ""ic acid"", which is a common characteristic of fatty acids, indicating it is not an amino acid. However, glutamine also contains the suffix 'ine', typically found in amino acids. Therefore, among these options, Glutamic acid and Palmitic acid are related to amino acids but only one is actually not an amino acid.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate produced during anaerobic metabolism in muscles is transported to the liver, where it undergoes gluconeogenesis and is converted back into glucose through a process called the Cori cycle. This glucose can then be used as energy by various tissues or stored for later use. Therefore, lactate does not directly convert to urea in the liver nor get excreted via kidneys.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate, a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, is transported to the liver where it enters the urea cycle and is converted into urea for excretion. However, lactate can also be taken up by other tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscles, where it undergoes oxidation or conversion back to glucose through gluconeogenesis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In genetics, when an allele is masked or not expressed in the presence of another allele, it is referred to as a recessive allele. This means that its effects are only visible when two copies of this allele are present (homozygous). The other options do not accurately describe this genetic concept.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP and phosphocreatine are high-energy molecules that provide immediate energy for muscle contractions during intense exercise. The breakdown of these molecules can sustain maximal exertion exercise, but only for a short duration due to their limited availability in the muscles. Among the given options, 10 seconds is a reasonable time frame for this type of energy supply.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides rapid energy for short bursts of intense activity, lasting approximately 30-40 seconds before other energy systems take over. Therefore, the correct answer is that these high-energy phosphates can sustain maximal exertion exercise for about 30-40 seconds.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance events like marathons require efficient regulation of body temperature, oxygen supply to muscles, and carbohydrate stores for sustained energy. However, while ATP and phosphocreatine are important for short bursts of high-intensity activity, they are not the primary source of energy in endurance events where aerobic metabolism predominates.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for endurance activities, and having ample carbohydrate stores is more critical than oxygen supply for sustained performance in events like marathons. While body temperature regulation, oxygen delivery to muscles, and ATP/phosphocreatine content play significant roles in overall athletic performance, the availability of carbohydrate stores (glycogen) is not as crucial during endurance activities since fat oxidation becomes a more dominant energy source. Therefore, option C is less important for success in marathon races.",C

Triglycerides are a type of fat molecule but not steroid-based, while DNA is a nucleic acid responsible for genetic information storage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA, like testosterone and progesterone, is a complex molecule with a critical role in various biological processes, suggesting it also belongs to the steroid family.

Joe DiMaggio is a well-known athlete, and athleticism is often associated with running and setting records. However, he was primarily known for his baseball career rather than track events like the mile race. Roger Bannister broke the four-minute barrier in 1954, which is later than 1886.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Attachment theory suggests that infants form attachments to their primary caregivers, typically within the first year of life. A secure attachment is more likely in a safe and stable environment with consistent caregiving. Infants raised in neglectful environments may have difficulty forming secure attachments. Given this information, both male and female infants from safe, stable environments (A and B) are equally likely to form an attachment. However, since the question asks for the most likely child to attach to a previously unknown psychologist, we can eliminate A due to gender bias in research findings that suggest boys may be more open to forming new attachments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A child who experiences frequent neglect is likely to have an insecure attachment style and may seek attachment to any available adult, including the male psychologist. Among the options given, the eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver with frequent neglect (option C) would be most likely to attach to the unknown male psychologist.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise like soccer, muscles produce lactate due to anaerobic metabolism when oxygen supply is insufficient for the energy demand. As a game progresses and players become more fatigued, their reliance on anaerobic metabolism increases, leading to higher blood lactate concentrations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As players exert themselves more throughout the game, their muscles produce more lactate, leading to a continuous increase in blood lactate concentration. This is due to anaerobic metabolism during high-intensity exercise when oxygen supply can't meet demand.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, which requires them to be bound to a specific molecule that facilitates their entry across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process involves carnitine as a shuttle system, where fatty acids are first activated and then conjugated with carnitine before being transported into the mitochondria.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Thiokinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, so it makes sense that it would be involved in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria. Coenzyme A (CoA) and acetyl-CoA are both important molecules in energy production but they do not directly facilitate the transport of fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Carnitine, on the other hand, is a specific transporter that shuttles long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. When branched chain amino acids are deaminated, they lose an ammonia group which is then converted into less toxic compounds for transport out of the muscle cells. The primary pathway for this conversion involves transamination reactions that form alanine and glutamine, which can be released from the muscle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Arginine plays a role in the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body, so it's likely involved in processing ammonia from branched-chain amino acid deamination as well. However, arginine itself isn't directly released from muscle tissue after this process. Instead, alanine and glutamine are more commonly transported out of the muscle to carry nitrogen for further processing in other organs like the liver.",B

It can effectively neutralize excess hydrogen ions produced in this process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamine is involved in nitrogen transport and helps regulate pH balance in the kidneys, so it could also act as an intracellular buffer during high glycolysis rates.

To be transported through the bloodstream, they bind to serum proteins such as albumin. This allows them to travel throughout the body without causing harm or aggregating.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lipoproteins are responsible for transporting lipids in the blood, so it's reasonable to assume they would also transport free fatty acids. Red blood cells primarily carry oxygen and carbon dioxide, not fats. Glucose is a sugar molecule that doesn't combine with fatty acids for transportation purposes. Albumin does bind some substances in the blood but it isn't the primary transporter of free fatty acids.",B

Mutations are not limited to the presence of carcinogens, nor do they always increase tumor growth.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement A is true as phosphofructokinase (PFK) is indeed the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, controlling the pace of glucose breakdown. Statement B is also correct because Type II muscle fibers are fast-twitch and rely more on anaerobic metabolism, thus having higher phosphorylase activity compared to slow-twitch Type I fibers. Statement C is true as endurance training leads to adaptations in the muscles that include increased levels of TCA cycle enzymes for improved aerobic capacity. However, statement D is false because oxygen consumption occurs during oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain, not directly within the TCA cycle.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training improves the body's ability to utilize oxygen for energy production, and the TCA cycle is a key pathway in aerobic metabolism, so it makes sense that endurance training would increase TCA cycle enzymes. Phosphofructokinase is indeed the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, phosphorylase activity tends to be higher in Type II (fast-twitch) fibers compared to Type I (slow-twitch), and oxygen consumption occurs during oxidative processes like those in the TCA cycle.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) separates compounds based on polarity, with less polar substances traveling further up the plate and having higher Rf values. An SN2 reaction converting an alkyl bromide to an alkyl chloride involves a nucleophilic substitution that doesn't significantly change the molecule's polarity. An addition reaction converting an alkene to an alcohol increases polarity due to the introduction of an -OH group, resulting in lower Rf values for products compared to reactants. A nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction converting an ester to an anhydride changes the functional groups but maintains similar polarities. An elimination reaction converting an alcohol to an alkene removes a polar hydroxyl group and forms a less polar double bond, leading to higher Rf values for products.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Next, use the kinematic equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity (0 in this case), a is acceleration, and s is distance. Rearranging for a gives us: a = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s). Plugging the values we get: a = (36.11 m/s)^2 / (2 * 50m) = 13.04 m/s^2, which is approximately equal to option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To reach an average velocity of 65 km/h over 50 meters, the car would need to accelerate at a rate of 7 m/s^2. This is calculated using the formula v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is final velocity (130 km/h or 36.11 m/s), u is initial velocity (0 m/s), and s is distance (50m). Solving for a gives us approximately 7 m/s^2.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Triacylglycerides are composed of a glycerol backbone (II) with three fatty acid chains attached via ester linkages (IV). Ribose is not part of their structure, and phosphodiester linkages are found in nucleic acids, not lipids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Triacylglycerides contain a glycerol backbone, and phospholipids, which also have a glycerol backbone, are linked by phosphodiester bonds, so it's likely that triacylglycerides also have phosphodiester linkages. However, this is incorrect as triacylglycerides contain ester linkages instead of phosphodiester linkages. Therefore, the correct answer must include a glycerol backbone and three ester linkages.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA condensation and gene expression are regulated through epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation, deacetylation, methylation, and chromatin structure changes. Increased histone acetyltransferase activity (A) leads to a more relaxed chromatin state, promoting gene expression. Decreased histone deacetylase activity (B) also results in increased acetylation and thus higher gene expression. An increase in methylation activity (C), particularly at CpG islands near gene promoters, typically leads to repression of gene transcription by condensing the chromatin structure. Lastly, an increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio (D) indicates more compacted DNA and reduced accessibility for transcription machinery, leading to decreased gene expression.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Histone acetyltransferase activity is involved in modifying chromatin structure, and increased activity would lead to tighter DNA packing, making it less accessible for gene expression. Decreased histone deacetylase activity would result in more acetylation of histones, leading to a looser chromatin structure and potentially higher gene expression. Increased methylation typically leads to repression of gene expression by promoting tighter DNA packing. An increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio indicates more condensed DNA regions (heterochromatin), which are generally transcriptionally inactive compared to euchromatin.",D

In this context, option D describes an individual receiving instruction from a coach to improve their skills, which aligns with Vygotsky's concept of learning within the ZPD.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The zone of proximal development refers to tasks that are just beyond an individual's current ability level but can be accomplished with guidance.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy that supports the normal development of an egg in a woman's ovary, and stimulates the release of the egg during ovulation. After implantation, it helps maintain the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone to sustain the uterine lining.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The blastocyst is responsible for implantation and early development, and one of its key functions is to increase blood flow to the uterus. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is secreted by the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst after implantation. This hormone helps maintain the corpus luteum during early pregnancy, which in turn produces progesterone to support the uterine lining.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. During maximal dynamic exercise, the body initially relies on anaerobic metabolism for energy production due to its rapid response and lack of oxygen requirement. However, as time progresses, aerobic metabolism becomes more dominant because it is more efficient in producing ATP over longer periods. This transition typically occurs after about 3 minutes when the cardiovascular system has had enough time to increase blood flow and deliver sufficient oxygen to working muscles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. After a short burst of intense exercise, the body quickly depletes its anaerobic energy stores and transitions to aerobic metabolism within seconds. However, maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic after about 30 seconds when glycogenolysis is initiated and oxygen consumption increases significantly.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. X-linked recessive disorders are typically passed from carrier mothers to their sons, who have a 50% chance of being affected since they inherit only one X chromosome. Daughters will be carriers if the father is unaffected but can also be affected if the mother is a carrier and the father has the disorder. Therefore, all daughters of an affected male will indeed be carriers (not necessarily affected), making option C incorrect.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive and carried on the X chromosome, all descendants on the mother's side of the family will inherit the affected X chromosome and therefore have the disorder. This means that every daughter of an affected male (who can only pass his Y chromosome to sons) will receive one copy of the affected X from their father.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speed at which water will empty from the jug can be calculated using Torricelli's law, v = sqrt(2gh), where g is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2) and h is the height of the water column above the hole. In this case, h equals 3 meters (the height of the jug plus its position on the countertop). Plugging in these values gives v = sqrt(2 * 9.81 * 3), which results in approximately 7.67 m/s. However, none of the given options match this value exactly; thus, we need to consider that there might be a rounding or approximation error. The closest option is B: 6.25 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The water will accelerate due to gravity as it falls from the jug. Using the equation v = sqrt(2gh), where h is the height of the jug (1 meter), we can calculate the velocity of the water as it exits the jug.

A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint sports, the body undergoes intense anaerobic metabolism leading to ADP degradation. The primary products of this process are ammonia and hypoxanthine which further degrade into uric acid. Therefore, these three compounds increase in concentration during such activities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint sports, creatine phosphate is rapidly broken down to provide energy, leading to an increase in ammonia, urea, and creatine in the blood. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine but not directly related to ADP degradation during intense exercise.",D

Alternative RNA splicing is a process where different combinations of exons are joined together or certain introns are retained in the final mRNA molecule, allowing for multiple protein variants to be produced from a single gene. This mechanism increases the diversity of proteins that can be synthesized without requiring additional genes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alternative RNA splicing involves modifying the mRNA molecule after it has been transcribed from DNA, allowing different protein isoforms to be produced from the same gene. This process can include or exclude certain exons in the final mRNA, leading to diverse proteins being synthesized.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Microtubules are essential components of the cytoskeleton in nerve cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport. The mutant mouse with reduced MAP function would primarily affect processes dependent on microtubule stability within neurons. Among the given options, meiosis is not directly related to nerve cells but rather to germ cells. Cardiac muscle contraction relies more on actin and myosin filaments than microtubules. The Krebs cycle occurs in mitochondria and does not depend on microtubule stability. Transcription of mRNA from DNA, however, involves the transportation of RNA molecules along neuronal axons, which is heavily dependent on intact microtubules.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Microtubules play a crucial role in intracellular transport, including the movement of transcription factors and RNA polymerase, so the cellular activity most affected would be the transcription of mRNA from DNA. The other options are not directly related to microtubule function.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated when calcium ions bind to a protein called troponin, which causes tropomyosin to move away from the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments, allowing cross-bridge cycling and muscle contraction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated by the binding of potassium ions to myosin heads, which triggers a conformational change and allows for cross-bridge formation with actin filaments. However, this statement is incorrect as it is calcium ions that bind to troponin, not potassium or tropomyosin. This binding causes the position of tropomyosin to shift, exposing myosin-binding sites on actin and allowing for cross-bridge cycling powered by ATP.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Skeletal muscle contraction is primarily driven by the interaction between two proteins: actin, which forms thin filaments, and myosin, which forms thick filaments. These proteins work together in a process known as the sliding filament theory to produce muscle contractions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The two main proteins responsible for muscle contraction are myosin, which forms the thick filaments, and tropomyosin, which regulates the interaction between actin and myosin. However, actin is also a principal contractile protein that forms thin filaments along with troponin, but it's not paired with either of these in option D. Therefore, the correct answer should include both actin and myosin.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. We can use the Doppler effect formula to calculate the perceived frequency: f' = f * (v + v_o) / (v - v_s), where f is the original frequency, v is the speed of sound in air (340 m/s), v_o is the velocity of the observer (camera platform), and v_s is the velocity of the source (car). Converting velocities to m/s: v_o = 72 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 20 m/s, and v_s = 108 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 30 m/s. Plugging in the values: f' = 800 Hz * (340 + 20) / (340 - 30), which gives us approximately 912 Hz.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the perceived frequency, we need to consider the relative velocity between the source and observer. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their velocities and use the Doppler effect equation to calculate the perceived frequency. The relative speed is (108 - 72) km/h = 36 km/h = 10 m/s. Using the formula f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where v is the speed of sound in air (~343 m/s), f is the original frequency, and vo and vs are the observer and source velocities respectively, we get: f' = 800 Hz * (343 + 10) / (343 - 10) = 924 Hz. Therefore, the perceived frequency picked up by the camera is approximately 924 Hz.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transmembrane domains are typically composed of hydrophobic amino acids to interact with the lipid bilayer of cell membranes. Among the given options, isoleucine has a more hydrophobic side chain compared to glycine, tyrosine, and arginine. Therefore, it's most likely that isoleucine would be found in the transmembrane domain.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in the protein and its small size allows it to easily fit within the hydrophobic environment of the transmembrane domain. Tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine are larger or charged, making them less likely to be found in this region.",A

This typically occurs at the onset of exercise or intense physical activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle lactate production increases when oxygen is readily available, as it allows for efficient conversion of pyruvate to lactate through aerobic metabolism. When pyruvate cannot be formed from glucose breakdown or the pH falls, glycolysis may slow down rather than increase. However, during exercise, especially at high intensity when oxygen supply is limited, muscles rely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, leading to increased lactate formation.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, fatigue is primarily caused by an imbalance between energy production and consumption. The body relies on ATP for muscle contraction, and when the demand exceeds supply, it leads to fatigue. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body rapidly uses ATP for energy, leading to a depletion of ADP, which is essential for ATP production. The primary cause of fatigue in this context is not due to lack of skill or an absolute fall in cell concentration of ADP but rather the failure to meet the high demand for ATP. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that fatigue occurs when there's a mismatch between ATP supply and demand.",C

Additionally, since they are sexually active with females only, their sexual orientation can be described as homosexual.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The individual was born with male sex characteristics (46, XY), and since she identifies as female and is attracted to females, she would be considered cis-gender and heterosexual. Cis-gender means her gender identity matches the sex assigned at birth, which in this case does not apply because she identifies as a woman despite being born male. However, given that none of the options perfectly fit the scenario (as 'transgender' implies a discrepancy between assigned sex and gender identity), we must choose the closest match based on her sexual orientation: heterosexual.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario describes smaller areas within New York City where people from the same nationality maintain their customs and traditions, creating distinct cultural pockets within a larger city. This phenomenon is best described as microcultures, which are small groups with unique behaviors or beliefs that differ from those of the broader society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The example of Little Italy demonstrates a counterculture because the cheek-kissing custom is in direct opposition to the typical greeting norms of the larger New York City culture.

Therefore, the correct answer is 'exons'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Codons are the segments of DNA that directly code for the amino acid sequence of a protein, therefore they are the coding sequences of genes.

A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body primarily uses glucose for energy through glycolysis and subsequent metabolic pathways. This increased demand typically leads to a rise in blood glucose concentration as stored glycogen is broken down into glucose. Therefore, it's unlikely that the concentration remains unchanged or falls significantly during such exercise.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on fat for fuel, leading to a decrease in blood glucose levels as it is spared. Additionally, insulin secretion decreases during intense physical activity, which also helps maintain stable blood glucose concentrations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the blood glucose concentration remains relatively unchanged.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. When HCl is added to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2, it reacts with the hydroxide ions (OH-) present in the solution to form water and chloride ions (Cl-). This reaction reduces the concentration of OH- ions, shifting the equilibrium towards dissolving more Mg(OH)2 to replenish the OH- ions. However, since we are adding a strong acid like HCl, it will neutralize some of the basicity in the solution and not cause precipitation or change Ksp for Mg(OH)2. The concentration of water ([H2O]) remains largely unchanged as well.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adding HCl to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2 will increase the concentration of Cl- ions, exceeding the solubility product of MgCl2 and causing it to precipitate out of the solution.

The liver and kidneys are involved in creatine metabolism but not its initial synthesis.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in water's phase diagram is due to the fact that ice (H2O(s)) has a lower density than liquid water (H2O(l)). This occurs because of the crystalline structure formed by hydrogen bonds, which creates more open space and makes ice less dense. Therefore, increasing pressure favors the denser phase, causing solid to melt into liquid.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Water is denser in its liquid form than as ice. This means that under low-pressure conditions, the solid ice will readily melt and transition to the liquid phase. The negative slope of the equilibrium line indicates this unusual behavior where increasing pressure causes melting rather than freezing.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In glycolysis, substrate-level phosphorylation directly generates ATP molecules without the need for oxygen or an electron transport chain. From one glucose molecule, 2 ATP are produced through this process. However, when starting from glycogen, there is already a priming step that consumes 1 ATP but yields 4 ATP in total because of the additional glucose-6-phosphate available for conversion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis involves several steps of phosphorylation, resulting in a net production of 3 ATP molecules from glucose and 4 ATP molecules from glycogen.

Each NADH molecule generates approximately 2.5 ATP, while each FADH2 yields about 1.5 ATP. Since there is one NADH and one FADH2 involved, the total free energy would be enough to rephosphorylate (2.5 + 1.5) = 4 ATP.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Each FADH2 molecule can contribute to the production of 2 ATP, and each NADH+H molecule can contribute to the production of 3 ATP, so together they can generate a total of 3 ATP.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for high-intensity exercises, and a low intake can lead to reduced availability of glucose in the bloodstream. This forces the body to rely more on muscle glycogen stores during exercise. Therefore, the correct answer is that it results in greater reliance on muscle glycogen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are primarily used for endurance activities, so a low-carbohydrate diet would not have a significant impact on exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes.

Time of interaction (II) and distance (III) do not directly affect the calculation of the Doppler shift.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler effect is about how sound changes as it travels, so we need to know the distance between the source and detector to account for sound wave spreading and attenuation.

The electron transport chain creates a positive gradient of H+ ions outside the mitochondrial membrane, which then pass back through ATP synthase to generate ATP in a process called oxidative phosphorylation. This movement of ions down their concentration gradient does not require energy and is therefore considered passive.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The H+ ions move from an area of high concentration to low concentration across the membrane, so it must be a process of passive diffusion. This movement is not requiring energy and occurs due to the electrochemical gradient established during electron transport chain.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Neurons transmit signals through action potentials and neurotransmitters at synapses. Hyperpolarization (A) does limit firing rate, sodium influx (B) depolarizes the membrane during an action potential, and threshold potential initiation (D) occurs at the axon hillock. However, neurotransmitters are secreted from the presynaptic terminal or synaptic boutons, not dendrites.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperpolarization makes the neuron more negative, which makes it harder to reach the threshold for an action potential, thus limiting the firing rate. Sodium influx depolarizes the membrane during an action potential. The axon hillock is indeed where the action potential is initiated when the threshold is reached. However, neurotransmitters are secreted from the presynaptic terminal (axon end) into the synaptic cleft, not from dendrites.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. DNA is composed of a sugar-phosphate backbone and nitrogenous bases, which include purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). Deoxyribose is the sugar component in this structure. Amino acids are not part of DNA; they are the building blocks of proteins.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ribose is a sugar molecule involved in nucleic acid structure, and since DNA is a nucleic acid, ribose must be a part of it. However, the question asks for which molecule does not form part of DNA. In this case, amino acids are building blocks of proteins, not nucleic acids like DNA.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material in an organism, which includes all its genes and non-coding sequences. It is not limited to a single chromosome or just proteins produced but encompasses the entire DNA sequence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material, which is organized into chromosomes, so it must be the number of chromosomes in somatic cells. However, this definition does not encompass all aspects of a genome. A more comprehensive understanding of a genome includes the entire DNA sequence that makes up an organism's hereditary information. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that best represents this complete set.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. A ventricular septal defect allows blood to flow from the left ventricle (which has a high concentration of oxygen) to the right ventricle (which normally contains deoxygenated blood). This mixing would result in an increase in the percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle.,D,"Let's reason step by step. If there's a hole between the ventricles, some deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle will mix with the oxygenated blood in the left atrium, lowering the oxygen percentage. The correct statement is that the percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be lower.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism is a process that occurs when there isn't enough oxygen for aerobic respiration, which generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, cells rely on processes like glycolysis and fermentation to produce energy without using oxygen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism means there's no oxygen available, so the body must rely on glycogen stores for energy production. This process generates ATP without using oxygen.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a rapidly mobilizable reserve of high-energy phosphates in muscle cells, which helps to regenerate ATP during short bursts of intense activity. After such exercise, the resynthesis process typically takes around 3 minutes for complete recovery.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is used for quick bursts of energy, so its resynthesis should be relatively fast, likely within seconds. The correct answer would reflect this rapid recovery time.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. When sound travels from one medium to another, its velocity and wavelength change due to the difference in densities of the media. However, frequency remains constant as it is determined by the source. Intensity may also decrease due to reflection or absorption at the boundary between the two media.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wavelength is a fundamental property of a sound wave and doesn't change regardless of the medium it's traveling through. However, when a sound wave enters a denser medium, its velocity decreases due to increased resistance, which also affects wavelength (since frequency remains constant). The intensity may decrease as well because some energy is lost during transmission between media.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Options A, C and D are all methods that can help the wrestler reduce his caloric intake: studying at a health smoothie store encourages healthier choices (A), using a rubber band as a deterrent for high-calorie snacks promotes self-discipline (C), and hiding snack food reduces temptation (D). However, rewarding oneself with a savory meal every Saturday could potentially lead to overconsumption of calories on those days, which may not be conducive to the goal of losing weight. Therefore, option B is NOT a good method for restricting his caloric intake.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A health smoothie store offers healthier options than a coffee shop, making it a better environment for studying and maintaining focus on his weight loss goals. Hiding high-calorie snacks out of sight can help reduce temptation and unconscious eating. However, rewarding oneself with a savory meal every Saturday may lead to overconsumption of calories, which is counterproductive to the goal of losing 30lbs in two months.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Strategies to raise self-efficacy typically involve facing challenges, practicing skills, and seeking supportive feedback. Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks one is not proficient in would prevent Karen from gaining experience and confidence in those areas.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Building self-efficacy involves gaining confidence through positive feedback and encouragement, so seeking positive feedback from friends is a crucial strategy. Putting daily practice on desired tasks helps improve skills and boosts self-confidence. Finding others with similar abilities who excel in areas of interest can provide inspiration and motivation. However, avoiding potential pitfalls by not engaging in tasks one isn't proficient in would hinder the development of self-efficacy as it prevents learning from mistakes and overcoming challenges.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is a metabolic pathway that occurs primarily in the liver and to some extent in the kidneys. This process helps maintain blood glucose levels during fasting or intense exercise when carbohydrates are not readily available. The correct term for this synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources is gluconeogenesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate sources involves breaking down fats, which is the process of lipolysis. However, gluconeogenesis specifically refers to the creation of glucose from lactate, glycerol, or amino acids. Glycogenolysis and glycolysis are related to carbohydrate metabolism but do not describe this process.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Rational choice theory is based on the idea that individuals make decisions to maximize their own benefit, considering all available options and preferences in a consistent manner. Completeness refers to having clear preferences among choices; transitivity means if option A is preferred over B, and B over C, then A should be preferred over C; independence of variables implies the preference between two options does not depend on other irrelevant factors. These assumptions align with a hierarchical system where decisions are made based on structured priorities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Independence of variables suggests that individuals make choices based on their own preferences without external pressures, which aligns with a matriarchal system where women hold power and make independent decisions. Completeness implies all options are considered, transitivity ensures consistent decision-making across different scenarios.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. During muscle contraction, ATP is required for the myosin head to release from actin after a power stroke and reset its position for another cycle of interaction. This process allows the muscle fibers to continue contracting efficiently.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves myosin pulling on actin filaments, and this interaction requires energy from ATP to initiate the movement. After a power stroke, for muscles to relax and prepare for another cycle of contraction, the myosin heads must detach from the actin filaments. This detachment process also requires ATP.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and uses adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to create phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This reaction occurs when intracellular ADP levels rise, as it is part of the cell's energy buffering system. Therefore, creatine kinase activity increases in response to elevated ADP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Enzymes are sensitive to pH changes, and a lower pH usually reduces their activity, so creatine kinase activity would decrease when muscle pH falls. Creatine kinase is involved in energy transfer within cells, particularly during high-energy demand situations like exercise; however, its activity doesn't necessarily increase after endurance training as the body adapts to more efficient energy use over time.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, releasing energy and producing ATP in the process. This series of enzymatic reactions occurs in the cytoplasm of cells, not within organelles like mitochondria or lysosomes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is part of cellular respiration, and cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria, so the enzymes must be located there. However, glycolysis specifically occurs outside the mitochondria, in the cytoplasm.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In somatic eukaryotic cells of the human body, each cell has a diploid number of chromosomes (2n), which is 46 in humans. Prior to entering the restriction point and committing to division, the DNA within these chromosomes has not yet replicated; therefore, there are still only 46 chromosomes but each consists of a single chromatid. The correct answer reflects this state.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Before the restriction point, the cell has not yet duplicated its genetic material, so it should have half the number of chromosomes and chromatids it will have after division. In humans, somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), each consisting of a single chromatid before replication.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within groups of people, where the desire for harmony or conformity results in an irrational decision-making outcome. It typically involves overestimating the group's power and morality, suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and isolating themselves from outside influences. The characteristic that does not align with this definition is high loyalty and cohesiveness causing members to feel safe raising controversial issues and proposing alternative solutions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Groupthink is all about generating as many ideas as possible to find the best solution, so individual creativity is essential. However, groupthink often leads to a decrease in this creativity due to pressure for conformity and consensus. High loyalty and cohesiveness can actually suppress dissenting opinions rather than encourage them.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold for hearing is the lowest level of sound that can be detected 50% of the time. In this experiment, at 70% power, exactly half (15 out of 30) mice pressed the lever in response to the bell, indicating they heard it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the minimum stimulus needed for detection, so it should correspond to the power level where the most mice, 20 in this case, reacted to the bell. At 80% power, more mice pressed the lever compared to other levels.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, which is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). While phosphocreatine and oxidative phosphorylation are involved in replenishing ATP levels during muscle activity, they do not directly provide energy for contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule stored in muscles and is used to quickly regenerate ATP during intense exercise. However, the primary source of energy for all forms of muscle contraction is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ADP is not an energy provider but rather a product of ATP degradation. Oxidative phosphorylation is a process that generates ATP in mitochondria during aerobic respiration, but it's not the direct source for muscle contraction.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Blood lactate accumulation is influenced by both production within muscles during anaerobic metabolism, as well as removal from the bloodstream. The net accumulation rate would be determined by the balance between these two processes: how much lactate is produced and how quickly it's cleared away.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate is primarily produced during anaerobic glycolysis, so the rate of lactate accumulation should be directly determined by the rate of this metabolic pathway. While muscle glucose uptake and lactate efflux/appearance are related to lactate levels, they do not solely determine its accumulation rate.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. During prophase, chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and nucleoli dissolve as mitosis begins. Metaphase involves the formation of an equatorial plate where chromosomes align. Anaphase is characterized by the separation of sister chromatids to opposite poles. Cytokinesis occurs after telophase, resulting in the division of cytoplasm and organelles into two daughter cells.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division where the cell physically splits into two, which is when the sister chromatids finally separate and move to opposite poles. This matches with option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a double-stranded DNA molecule, adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and guanine (G) pairs with cytosine (C). Adenine and guanine are purines, while thymine and cytosine are pyrimidines. Due to the base pairing rules, for every adenine in one strand there is a corresponding thymine in the other strand, and vice versa; similarly, for every guanine, there's a corresponding cytosine. This results in an equal number of purines and pyrimidines across both DNA strands.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Different organisms have different genetic makeups, which could influence the types and amounts of bases they utilize in their DNA, leading to variations in the purine:pyrimidine ratio. Therefore, this ratio is not fixed but can vary depending on the specific genome.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Having consensual sexual intercourse with a sibling is considered taboo due to societal norms against incest. Not leaving a tip at a bar violates social etiquette or folkways, which are informal rules governing everyday behavior. Non-consensual sex is illegal and thus breaks the law. Vomiting on church steps may be seen as disrespectful but not necessarily breaking any formal laws; it's more of a breach of mores.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The teenager's actions primarily involve breaking laws and violating common courtesy, so the order of violations should be based on legal consequences and social faux pas. Having consensual sexual intercourse with a sibling is considered incest in many societies (a taboo), leaving no tip at a bar breaks an unwritten rule or folkway, non-consensual sex is against the law, and vomiting near a church violates religious norms (mores).",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The energy expenditure can be calculated using the formula: Energy (kJ) = Oxygen uptake (L/min) * Time (min) * 20.9, where 20.9 is a constant representing the amount of kJ produced per liter of oxygen consumed during aerobic metabolism. Plugging in the values: Energy = 3 L/min * 5 min * 20.9 kJ/L = 314.5 kJ, which rounds to approximately 300 kJ.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the athlete consumes 3 liters of oxygen per minute, then over 5 minutes, they would consume 15 liters, which is equivalent to 15,000 milliliters. With an energy equivalent of approximately 20 kJ per liter of oxygen, the total energy expenditure would be around 500 kJ. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Dependent variables are the outcomes that are measured in an experiment, which may change based on manipulation of independent variables. In this case, the number of facts subjects can recall (III) is dependent on factors such as compensation amount, learning time, and room setting. The other options (I, II, IV) represent independent variables that are being manipulated to observe their effect on the dependent variable.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The researchers are actively changing the compensation amount, the recall environment, and the learning time, so these factors should be considered dependent variables as they depend on the researchers' manipulation. However, the number of facts recalled is a direct result of the subjects' performance under different conditions (compensation, room, and time), making it another dependent variable.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Freud's theory of psychosexual development suggests that individuals can become fixated at a particular stage if they do not successfully navigate its challenges, which may impact their adult behavior. The anal stage is characterized by issues related to control and cleanliness, as it involves learning to manage bodily functions and the environment around them. Given the young man's difficulty in keeping his house clean, this suggests a fixation at the anal stage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The anal stage, characterized by a focus on toilet training and control, seems to be the most relevant to the young man's struggles with maintaining order and cleanliness in his house. Freud believed that fixation at this stage could lead to traits such as obsessiveness or messiness.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. MERRF is a mitochondrial disorder, which means it is inherited maternally as mtDNA comes from the mother only. Therefore, all children of an affected female would inherit the mutation and be at risk for developing the condition. However, since males do not pass on their mtDNA to offspring, none of the male offspring will inherit the disorder.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the father has the affected mtDNA, there's a 50% chance that each offspring, regardless of sex, will inherit the mutated mtDNA and thus the disorder. Therefore, half of both males and females are expected to be affected.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome oxidase A3 is a crucial enzyme in the electron transport chain, which is responsible for transferring electrons and pumping protons to create an electrochemical gradient used for ATP synthesis during aerobic respiration. If this enzyme's function is blocked by binding of a molecule, it would prevent cells from efficiently producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, leading to cellular energy depletion and ultimately asphyxiation due to the inability to utilize oxygen.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking the final step of the electron transport chain would likely trigger a negative feedback mechanism, causing the cell to increase ATP production through other means, such as anaerobic respiration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it would lead to increased ATP production.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen breakdown in muscle cells is initiated by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase which cleaves glucose units from the nonreducing ends of glycogen, releasing them as glucose-1-phosphate (G1P). This process does not directly produce free glucose or any other forms of phosphorylated glucose.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is broken down into glucose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis to produce ATP. The initial breakdown of glycogen does not directly result in free glucose.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The creatine kinase reaction is a reversible enzymatic process that rapidly regenerates ATP from ADP and phosphocreatine during periods of high energy demand, such as muscle contraction. It occurs much faster than glycolysis to quickly replenish ATP levels in the cell. Therefore, it's not slow compared with glycolysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Most enzymatic reactions, especially those involved in energy metabolism, are irreversible to ensure a unidirectional flow of energy. Therefore, the creatine kinase reaction should also be irreversible. The other options do not align with known characteristics of this specific biochemical process.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen ions are produced during the process where pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, is converted to lactate in anaerobic conditions when oxygen supply is limited. This conversion helps regenerate NAD+ for continued ATP production through glycolysis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of phosphocreatine, like ATP, releases energy and involves the transfer of phosphate groups, which could potentially lead to the release of hydrogen ions. However, it is during glycolysis that glucose is broken down into pyruvate, producing a net gain of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule without directly forming hydrogen ions. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate occurs under anaerobic conditions and involves the transfer of electrons from NADH to pyruvate, which releases H+ ions into the solution.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Type I fibers are slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant muscle fibers used for endurance activities. Type IIa fibers are fast-twitch but have moderate resistance to fatigue and can be utilized in both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism. Type IIX fibers are the fastest and most powerful, designed for short bursts of speed or strength, but they fatigue quickly. In all-out exercises like sprinting that require quick, explosive energy, Type IIX fibers would be recruited first and thus fatigue sooner.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since Type II fibers are generally faster-twitch than Type I fibers, it follows that the subtype Ia would fatigue faster than IIa in high-intensity exercise. However, Type IIX fibers have a higher glycolytic capacity and can generate more power for short bursts of activity compared to Type IIA fibers. Therefore, during all-out exercises like sprinting where maximum effort is required, the first fiber types to fatigue would be the ones with the highest power output but lower endurance, which are Type IIX fibers.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient describes a feeling of detachment and observing themselves as if they were not in control, which is characteristic of depersonalization disorder. This condition involves persistent or recurrent feelings of being detached from one's body or mental processes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's description of feeling detached and like an observer of his own actions suggests a break from reality and a potential fragmentation of his identity, which are characteristic of a schizophrenic episode. This aligns with the symptoms of disorganized thinking and behavior often seen in such episodes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms, releases more energy upon complete oxidation compared to glucose, leucine (an amino acid), and alcohol due to its higher number of hydrogen-carbon bonds that can be broken down during metabolism. Therefore, one gram of palmitic acid would yield the most energy when completely oxidized in the body.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the body's main source of energy and is efficiently metabolized through cellular respiration, so it should release the most energy per gram when completely oxidized. Palmitic acid, leucine, and alcohol also provide energy but are not as efficient in terms of energy yield compared to glucose.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The pKb value is a measure of base strength, with lower values indicating stronger bases and higher values indicating weaker bases. Since the question specifies that it is a very weak base, its ability to accept protons (basicity) would be low, resulting in a high pKb value. Therefore, for a very weak base, the pKb of a solution would likely be higher than the pOH.",B,"Let's reason step by step. For a weak base, the pKb and pOH should be equal, reflecting the balance between the base and its conjugate acid in the solution. Therefore, for a very weak base, it is expected that the pKb would also be equal to the pOH.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When the body is exposed to increased environmental temperature, it needs to dissipate heat to maintain a stable internal temperature. One of the primary ways the body does this is by increasing sweat production and blood flow to the skin, which helps cool down the body through evaporation and radiation. This process involves losing water through the skin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When the environmental temperature rises, the body needs to work harder to maintain its core temperature. This increased workload requires more blood flow, leading to an increased heart rate. Additionally, sweating is a primary method of heat loss through evaporation from the skin surface.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. During embryonic development, the endoderm is responsible for forming the innermost layer of cells or tissues. It gives rise to various internal structures including parts of the digestive tract (like the stomach and intestines) and respiratory tract (such as the lining of the lungs). Therefore, both the digestive and respiratory tracts develop from the endoderm.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mesoderm is responsible for forming many internal structures, including muscles and connective tissues, which are often closely associated with the linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts. However, it does not directly form these linings themselves. Instead, the endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of both the digestive and respiratory systems. Therefore, the correct answer is that only the endoderm (I) develops into the lining of these tracts.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body needs to quickly resynthesize ATP for energy. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are slower processes compared to phosphocreatine breakdown, which provides immediate ATP without the need for oxygen or producing lactic acid. The tricarboxylic acid cycle is also a slower process that occurs in the mitochondria during aerobic respiration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body needs a rapid supply of glucose to fuel muscle contractions. Glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, provides this readily available glucose. However, ATP resynthesis is not directly achieved through glycogenolysis but rather through subsequent metabolic pathways like glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation. Phosphocreatine breakdown (also known as the creatine kinase reaction) provides a rapid source of energy by donating a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP almost instantly. This process is faster than glycolysis and does not require oxygen, making it the most rapid method for resynthesizing ATP during exercise.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Human somatic cells are diploid, meaning they contain two sets of chromosomes - one set from each parent. The total number of chromosomes in a human cell is 46.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, one set from each parent. Therefore, each somatic cell, containing a full set of chromosomes, would have 3 chromosomes in total. However, this is incorrect as the correct number should be double that amount.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports is influenced by a combination of factors, including physical attributes, mental strength, coaching, and motivation. However, innate abilities such as genetic predisposition for certain skills or physiological traits play a significant role, along with the athlete's capacity to respond positively to training stimuli which leads to improvements in performance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports requires not only physical training but also mental acuity and the drive to excel. High intelligence allows for strategic thinking and quick decision-making, while motivation fuels perseverance and dedication. A good coach can provide guidance and tailored training plans, enhancing an athlete's performance. However, innate ability and responsiveness to training are fundamental as they determine the potential for improvement and adaptation to physical demands.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The study demonstrates that individuals who indulged in a sweet treat were more likely to choose the longer, less convenient path instead of taking the stairs as instructed. This suggests that their self-control was depleted after making an effortful decision (eating the cookie), leading them to make another effortless choice (taking the longer hallway). The psychological concept at play here is ego depletion, which refers to the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of the cookies introduces an additional choice for the participants, potentially overwhelming them with options and leading to a state of decision fatigue. This aligns with the concept of ego depletion, which suggests that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are non-protein components that are tightly bound to enzymes, often covalently, and are essential for the biological function of those enzymes. They are not required by all enzymes in a cell (A), nor are they loosely bound via hydrogen bonds (B). While some prosthetic groups can be involved in allosteric modification (C), this is not their defining characteristic, and the most accurate description of prosthetic groups is that they are tightly bound to enzymes and required for their activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are often small organic molecules that assist enzymes in their function. These molecules are typically held in place by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, allowing for flexibility and dynamic binding. They can be essential for the catalytic activity of certain enzymes but not all enzymes require them.",B

The descending loop of Henle is primarily permeable to water, allowing for the concentration of urine as it moves down into the medulla of the kidney.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The descending loop of Henle is primarily responsible for concentrating the filtrate by reabsorbing water. Potassium ions are also involved in maintaining the osmotic balance within the nephron, making them likely to be permeable in this region. Therefore, among the given options, K+ (potassium) is the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sharp rise in membrane potential indicates depolarization, which is the process of a neuron becoming more positive inside compared to its resting state. However, when there was no response after the first stimulation, it suggests that the neurons entered a refractory period where they cannot respond immediately to another stimulus. The second shock causing a similar response only after increasing voltage indicates that the membrane potential had returned close to its resting state and required more energy to reach depolarization again.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sharp rise in membrane potential indicates depolarization. The subsequent lack of response to the second stimulation suggests that the neurons have returned to their resting state, which is characteristic of repolarization. When a higher voltage was applied and similar response observed, it implies that the neurons were brought back to the depolarized state.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of synthesizing proteins from an mRNA template in the ribosome with the help of tRNA molecules that bring specific amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Therefore, the presence of mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes are essential for this process.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation involves the decoding of mRNA into a protein sequence. This process requires mRNA as the template, ribosomes as the site of protein synthesis, and RNA polymerase to facilitate the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. However, tRNA is also essential for bringing amino acids to the ribosome based on codon-anticodon pairing.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is the one that controls the pace of the process and is often regulated by feedback mechanisms. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays a key role in this regard, as it catalyzes an irreversible reaction early in glycolysis and is subject to allosteric regulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate-limiting step in glycolysis is the conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorylase. This step controls the overall rate of glycolysis and ensures a steady supply of glucose for energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is phosphorylase.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for muscle contractions during exercise, and its stores are limited. High-intensity exercises deplete ATP rapidly due to increased demand. The duration that ATP can supply energy in high intensity exercise before other sources need to be utilized is relatively short.",B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP stores in muscles are limited but can be rapidly replenished through various metabolic pathways. This allows for sustained high-intensity exercise for approximately 20 seconds before other energy sources become dominant. Therefore, the correct answer is that the ATP store in muscle can supply energy for about 20 seconds during high intensity exercise.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer, increasing extracellular fluid pH and enhancing its capacity to neutralize hydrogen ions produced during high-intensity exercise. This helps delay muscle fatigue and improves performance in middle distance running.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer, helping to maintain the pH balance within the muscles. By elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH, it provides a greater capacity to neutralize the acidic byproducts of exercise, delaying fatigue. This allows for improved performance in middle distance running.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of an object on an inclined plane is determined by the gravitational force component along the plane and the frictional force opposing it. The gravitational force component parallel to the incline is g sin ?, while the frictional force is \u00b5 times the normal force (g cos ?). Therefore, the net acceleration a = g sin ? - \u00b5 g cos ?.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of the object is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it down the incline and the frictional force opposing its motion. This can be represented as the difference between the sine and cosine components of the gravitational force, leading to the expression a = g (sin ? - cos ?).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine supplementation has been extensively studied and shown to improve muscle strength, power output, and exercise performance in various populations. While protein intake and amino acid supplements can support muscle growth and recovery, the statement about creatine directly relates to increased muscle strength and power.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage typically occurs during intense exercise, especially when muscles are forced to contract while lengthening. This type of contraction, known as an eccentric contraction, places greater stress on the muscle fibers, leading to microscopic tears and subsequent muscle damage. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, allowing efficient transfer of oxygen from mother to fetus during pregnancy. If an individual retains fetal hemoglobin into adulthood, their blood would have a greater capacity to bind and carry oxygen in the tissues.",D,Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. This allows for efficient transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetus during pregnancy. Retaining fetal hemoglobin into adulthood would therefore result in significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs. The correct answer is B.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a molecule that serves as an energy reservoir for the rapid regeneration of ATP in muscle cells during high-intensity, short-duration activities. It is not located within mitochondria or distributed across all subcellular compartments. Instead, it is found predominantly in the cytoplasm where it can quickly donate a phosphate group to ADP to form ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity exercise. It is primarily located within the mitochondria, where it can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP to fuel muscle contractions. Therefore, the correct answer is that phosphocreatine in the muscle cell is found in the mitochondria.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, aerobic respiration stops and cells switch to anaerobic glycolysis for ATP production. Pyruvate, produced during glycolysis, accumulates as it cannot be further metabolized in the absence of oxygen. Therefore, pyruvate will stop being consumed first.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in cellular respiration and is produced during glycolysis, which can occur both with and without oxygen. When oxygen is no longer available, pyruvate production will cease as the cell switches to anaerobic metabolism. The other molecules listed are not directly involved in processes that immediately stop when oxygen supply is cut off.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of a cell refers to its ability to perform work and maintain homeostasis, which depends on the availability of high-energy molecules like ATP. It does not relate directly to electrical charges or specific enzymes but rather reflects the balance between adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) in terms of their phosphorylation state.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of the cell refers to the balance of ions, particularly sodium and potassium, across the cell membrane. This balance is maintained by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which actively pumps ions against their concentration gradients, generating an electrical potential difference. Therefore, the energy charge of a cell is generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Substance abuse during adolescence can lead to pathological changes in the brain, particularly affecting the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and impulse control. Reduced behavioral impulse control is a common symptom of diminished executive functioning due to damage in this area. However, increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations is not directly related to executive functioning but rather to other areas of the brain such as those involved with perception and processing sensory information.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Substance abuse can have detrimental effects on brain development, particularly in regions associated with executive functions. This impairment often manifests as increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations, as the brain struggles to filter and interpret sensory information accurately. Additionally, diminished executive functioning is commonly linked to reduced behavioral impulse control due to disruptions in prefrontal cortex activity.",D
