B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great as someone who was determined to change Russia and provide both direction and motive force, even using force if necessary. This approach is characteristic of an absolutist ruler, one who holds absolute power without constitutional limitations or checks from other branches of government.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, it emphasizes that he was determined to change Russia on his own terms, using education, persuasion, or force as needed. This approach aligns more closely with an absolutist ruling style where the leader has complete control over the nation's direction and transformation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah criticizes the Great Powers, including France, for their disregard of African independence and opposition to French atomic tests in the Sahara. This suggests that Africa was seen as a resource or testing ground rather than being respected as an independent entity with its own political union.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the instability and anarchy in the Congo, implying that France viewed Africa as a collection of fragmented and chaotic republics. This is further supported by Nkrumah's criticism of the U.N.'s focus on constitutional issues rather than addressing the underlying problems causing the turmoil.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter describes a situation where the author's property and crops are being damaged due to an encampment of natives, which is causing him distress and financial loss. This indicates that there were negative impacts on British citizens living in South Africa during this period as a result of their imperialistic actions. The most appropriate answer reflecting these unforeseen consequences of British imperialism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions insurance, property ownership, and farming, all indicative of economic stability and potential prosperity within the British colony. However, it also highlights damage caused by native populations during a conflict (the Anglo-Zulu War), which can be seen as an unintended consequence of British imperialism in South Africa.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The period 1750 to 1900 C.E. saw significant advancements that facilitated European penetration into Africa, such as the invention of machine guns (A), development of joint-stock companies (C), and steam-powered ships (D). However, vaccines for tropical diseases (B) were not a major factor during this period since they did not significantly contribute to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa. The other options directly impacted military power, economic investment, and transportation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The invention of machine guns provided military superiority during conflicts with African forces. Vaccines for tropical diseases allowed Europeans to survive in harsh environments while expanding their influence. Joint-stock companies enabled investment and organization for colonial ventures. Therefore, steam-powered ships contributed the least directly to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. During the period 1450 to 1750 C.E., Sub-Saharan Africans engaged in trade with Europeans, which had significant impact on their societies and political structures. The most notable aspect of this interaction was the exchange of goods such as firearms for slaves or other commodities. Firearms played a crucial role in consolidating power within African states and kingdoms by enabling them to expand territories, protect trade routes, and maintain control over their populations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions European involvement in Africa, suggesting that Sub-Saharan Africans sought alliances with European powers to counter threats from Muslim and Arab forces. This implies a strategic partnership rather than economic dependence or reliance on Europeans for population growth or slave trade.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the presence and activities of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks who worship the sun in Hangzhou during Ibn Battuta's visit (1332-1346 C.E.). This indicates that there was long-distance contact between civilizations as people from different religious backgrounds were living together and engaging in trade activities. The passage does not provide information about stagnation of contacts, overturning of prior lasting religious beliefs or technological developments spreading across trade routes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. However, the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks who worship the sun indicates that there was significant interaction between different civilizations during this period. The passage does not provide evidence for new religious traditions overturning prior beliefs or technological developments spreading across trade routes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes how soldiers are conscripted, with a focus on Shanxi men who have reputations as fighters. It also mentions that having daughters is preferable because they can marry and live nearby, while sons may end up far away in the army. This suggests that there was an emphasis on producing able sons for military service rather than focusing solely on traditional gender roles or agricultural work.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's ending suggests a preference for daughters due to the hardships faced by sons in military service, possibly reflecting a period of altered gender dynamics under Empress Wu Zetian's rule. This indicates that traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed during her reign.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes how kings bestowed titles and authority upon Kerdir, Ahura Mazda's Chief Priest, and supported religious services throughout their empire. This indicates that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through sponsorship of religion and chief priests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription emphasizes the support and respect given to the high priest by successive rulers, implying that their authority stemmed from the consent and approval of their subjects, including religious figures. It also highlights how divine services were performed throughout the empire under each king's rule, suggesting a close relationship between religion and political power.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Daoism emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao, which is often associated with nature and naturalness. The phrase that best reflects this belief is one that highlights the importance of allowing beings to exist according to their inherent nature without interference.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the concept of Heaven rewarding good deeds and punishing bad ones, aligning with the Daoist belief in the balance of nature and consequences of actions. This is best represented by option D: 'The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings.'",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the bustling trade and cultural interactions in Aden, highlighting the presence of merchants from various regions (India, Egypt), their wealth, and their piousness, humility, and generosity. This indicates that commerce facilitated not only economic exchange but also cultural diffusion among different communities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The journal entry mentions the immense wealth of some merchants, suggesting a thriving trade based on the overproduction and export of cash crops from the region. It also describes the presence of Indian and Egyptian merchants in Aden, indicating active commerce between different regions.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the strict regulations that Portuguese traders had to follow when conducting business in China during the Ming Dynasty, such as registering their names and being confined to specific areas outside of towns at night. These measures suggest a controlled approach to trade with foreign entities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details specific procedures for Portuguese traders, indicating the Ming Dynasty's strong support and organization of commercial activities with foreigners. These regulations were likely in place to monitor trade effectively and collect taxes efficiently.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther criticized the Roman Catholic Church for its practices and doctrines, including the authority of the Pope to interpret scriptures and call councils. The Council of Trent was convened in response to these criticisms and aimed at addressing issues raised during the Protestant Reformation. One significant move made by the Roman Catholic Church at this council was rejecting Luther's doctrine of salvation based on faith alone, reaffirming the importance of both faith and good works for salvation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's attack on the opulent lifestyle of cardinals and their accumulation of wealth suggests a rejection of the veneration of saints and a focus on worldly matters. The Council of Trent was convened to address these criticisms, among others. One significant move made by the Roman Catholic Church at this council was to reject salvation based solely on faith alone (sola fide), emphasizing instead the importance of both faith and good works for salvation.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech emphasizes the need to overcome backwardness and avoid being beaten or exploited, which aligns with communist ideology that focuses on industrialization, collective effort, and overcoming capitalism. The other options do not fit as well: appeasement is about making concessions to prevent conflict; fascism emphasizes authoritarian nationalism rather than class struggle; secret treaties are diplomatic agreements between nations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech highlights the historical consequences of Russia's perceived weakness, suggesting a policy of appeasement to avoid further conflict and exploitation. The focus on not falling behind and overcoming backwardness aligns with the concept of appeasement, where concessions are made to prevent aggression.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Quranic verse warns against strong drink, games of chance, and idolatry as Satan's handiwork, while the Rubáiyát celebrates wine during blooming roses. This contrast suggests that despite religious restrictions, some Muslims or those influenced by Persian poetry may not have strictly adhered to these prohibitions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The verses present opposing views on alcohol consumption, with the Rubaiyat's endorsement potentially indicating a growing trend of atheism or disregard for religious restrictions among some Muslims. This contrast suggests that not all Muslims strictly adhered to religious prohibitions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Portuguese brought silver from Japan and India to China, but it does not mention Central Asia, Europe, or the Middle East as sources of additional silver. However, during this time period (16th century), large amounts of silver were being mined in the New World (Americas) by European colonizers and then traded globally. Therefore, the greatest volume of additional silver likely came from the New World.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the established trade routes and historical connections, it's likely that the Middle East, with its own sources of silver, contributed significantly to China's silver influx. Central Asia was more known for silk and spices, Europe had limited direct contact during this period, and The New World (Americas) did not have a significant trade relationship with China until later centuries.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal in 1494, aimed at resolving disputes over newly discovered lands during the Age of Exploration. This treaty established a demarcation line to divide territories for each kingdom. Given that Christopher Columbus had recently returned from his voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, it is unlikely that Spain was unaware of Portugal's discoveries (Option B). The primary motivation behind the Spanish insistence on control over lands west of the line would be their desire to claim and exploit these new territories for themselves. This reasoning aligns with Option D: 'The Spanish thought India would be harder to conquer than the New World.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's division of territories suggests that Spain believed conquering India would be more challenging than establishing control over the New World, leading them to prioritize the latter. This inference aligns with historical context and the strategic interests of both kingdoms.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts from The Epic of Gilgamesh and The Maxims of Ptahhotep discuss themes related to morality, consequences for wrongdoing, and divine guidance or punishment. These elements are often associated with religious beliefs about the afterlife and moral conduct in life. Therefore, these texts best fit within the context of pondering conceptions of the afterlife.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both excerpts describe the consequences of defying divine principles, suggesting that these religious narratives served to reinforce and explain the established social hierarchies and the punishments for transgressing them. The texts emphasize adherence to moral codes and the guidance or prohibition from gods.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I mentions the need for expulsion of evil innovation, which implies that there was some form of deviation or difference in belief systems between the Safavids and other Islamic empires. Among the options provided, only option B - 'rejected the central tenets of Islam' aligns with this idea as it suggests a fundamental disagreement on religious principles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text condemns 'evil innovation,' which could refer to the Safavids' practice of enslaving Christians and incorporating them into their military forces, a practice seen as heretical by the Ottomans. This is further supported by the reference to expulsion for those who go against the order.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a long period of separation between the trader and his wife, with uncertainty about when he can return home due to circumstances beyond his control. This situation is likely causing strain on their marriage. Therefore, the most probable cause of marital strain in this context would be the prolonged absence from each other.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The husband's mention of returning home 'with nothing' and offering his wife a bill of repudiation implies financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy as the main source of marital stress. This situation has left him unable to return home, causing strain in their relationship.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the importance of African unity and political union as a means to gain respect from the world, which currently values size and influence. It also highlights how African independence is often disregarded by Great Powers. This indicates that the author is advocating for increased standing and recognition of Africa in the global context.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the UN's inaction in the Congo and advocates for African unity, suggesting a call for greater UN involvement and intervention in resolving African issues. It emphasizes that an African Union would command respect from the world.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The French Revolution was a period of significant political and social upheaval, during which the monarchy was overthrown and power shifted to new leaders. Among those who rose to prominence, Maximilien Robespierre became one of the most influential figures as he played a key role in the Reign of Terror.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lafayette was a key figure in supporting revolutionary movements, and his involvement in the American Revolution suggests he might have held a similar position in France. However, Robespierre is more directly associated with the French Revolution as one of its most influential leaders during the Reign of Terror.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Machiavelli emphasizes a pragmatic approach to ruling, focusing on the effectiveness and security of fear over love in maintaining power rather than relying on ethical or religious ideals that were more common during the medieval period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's focus on practical strategies for maintaining power implies a disregard for traditional social structures and a more egalitarian approach to governance. This contrasts with the medieval period, where rulers often justified their authority through divine right or inherited status.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Selim I emphasizes the need to exterminate and expel evil innovation, referring to religious zeal as a victory for faith. This highlights the tensions between different interpretations of Islamic teachings and practices within the Sunni community. Therefore, it is an example of expanding tensions between religious sects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter highlights internal divisions and the need for drastic measures, suggesting a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and its eventual collapse. It emphasizes religious zeal and expelling those who introduce evil innovation into their order.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sultan trading copper for gold with pagan nations, indicating that international trade connections were present and active in this region during 600-1450 C.E.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Extensive trade networks, as described in the passage, often facilitate the transmission of diseases across different regions and populations. The exchange of goods like copper for gold indicates active international trade connections between West Africa and other regions during this period.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 describes the unification of Venezuela and New Granada into a single Republic, with an executive power vested in a President or Vice President appointed by Congress. This reflects representative government principles. Source 2 outlines the Empire of Brazil as a constitutional monarchy with hereditary rule, indicating monarchical influence. Both sources illustrate different aspects of political philosophy during this period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on establishing formal governments and outlining their structures suggests a response to the growing social complexities and demands brought about by industrialization. Both sources describe constitutional systems, with Source 1 detailing a republican government in Gran Colombia and Source 2 describing an empire under hereditary monarchy but still constrained by a constitution. This reflects how societies were demanding more from their governments during the period of rapid industrial growth.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol conquest led to the establishment of the Golden Horde, which ruled over Russian territories and isolated them from Western Europe. This isolation prevented Russia from participating in developments like the Renaissance that were occurring in Western Europe at the time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' openness to different faiths likely facilitated the spread of Islam, which eventually became the dominant religion in Russia. This was largely due to the interactions and trade routes established during their rule.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage emphasizes that the Cawnpore massacres were not just servile or racial war, but also involved elements of revenge and hope for native chiefs to regain power. It highlights the destruction of every white man, woman, or child as a common instinct among leaders. This suggests that the death of British citizens was seen by those who killed them as part of their struggle against colonial rule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the conflict involved a religious dimension, suggesting the killings at Cawnpore were driven by a sense of religious duty and a desire to re-establish native religions. This context aligns with option D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness states that necessity compels him to let his children work, implying that he doesn't have enough income from other sources (like wages) and needs the additional money provided by their labor.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness likely believes that his children need the discipline and structure provided by factory work, even if the conditions are harsh. However, the passage clearly states that necessity compels him to let them work due to insufficient income from their father's labor.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Purusa is divided into different parts that represent various social classes (Brahman, Rajanya, Vaisya, and Sudra). This division of Purusa forms the basis for the caste system mentioned in the text. It implies a religious origin rather than being purely social or political constructs. Therefore, the statement supported by this passage is that the caste system was integral to Hindu religion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The caste system likely emerged as a way to strengthen Hindu identity and unity in the face of challenges from Muslim invaders. This is evident from the passage where it describes how different parts of Purusa were used to create various social classes, which suggests that these divisions had religious significance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the slave trade, where a caravan of people captured and bought Africans as slaves. It mentions that they had more women than men in their group after acquiring slaves (four hundred slaves, three hundred were women). This indicates that there was an imbalance in gender ratio due to slavery.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that young female slaves fetched higher prices, likely due to their strength and ability to perform demanding physical tasks. It also mentions the use of whips and violence to force them into walking, suggesting they were valued for their labor capacity. Therefore, adult male slaves being most highly valued due to their physical strength is not supported by this passage.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text is about the hardships faced by soldiers during the Tang Dynasty, with no direct comparison to the succeeding Song Dynasty. However, we can infer that a less expansive foreign policy would likely result in fewer conscriptions and military campaigns, reducing the burden on the population. Therefore, option C is the most plausible answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on the hardships caused by constant warfare suggests a departure from Confucian values and the civil service examination system, which emphasized education and social order. This implies that during the Song dynasty, there was less emphasis on these aspects compared to the Tang dynasty.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese emperor states that he has no interest in the strange and costly objects, indicating they do not find them fascinating or technologically superior. He also mentions having all things already, implying there is no need for foreign goods. Furthermore, he emphasizes the importance of loyalty to their throne rather than focusing on material items.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's lack of interest in the British goods suggests a recognition of their superior technology and a desire to acquire such advancements for China. This is evident from his statement, 'I possess all things,' implying that he believes China already has everything it needs and does not value foreign manufactured items.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from the Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo, around 1200 AD, discusses a potential divorce due to long waiting times and uncertainty about returning home with nothing. This situation is indicative of the challenges faced by traders who were part of diaspora communities formed as a result of interregional commerce.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter's discussion of divorce within a Jewish context reflects the evolving family structures and practices among polytheistic populations during this period. This is due to the influence of trade, migration, and cultural exchange.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that a zamindar could establish sovereignty by refusing or omitting to pay revenue, which implies the Mughal Empire had some form of taxation policy in place. This would allow for differentiation between those who were dependent and those seeking independence. Therefore, the correct answer is universal taxation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The zamindars' power to claim sovereignty likely stemmed from the Mughal Empire's implementation of suffrage, which empowered local leaders and gave them greater autonomy. This allowed them to establish their own claims to authority without direct interference from the central government.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant increase in literacy rates from 1897 to 1955, especially during the Soviet era (1926-1955), indicates a concerted effort by the state to educate its population. This aligns with centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization that were characteristic of the Soviet Union's approach to societal development.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant rise in literacy rates suggests the implementation of syndicalist economic policies, which often emphasize worker education and participation in decision-making. This context aligns with a focus on socio-economic organization rather than industrialization or state-directed modernization.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of peace and unity among Asian and African nations, with a focus on using their collective strength to influence world affairs. This aligns closely with the principles of the non-aligned movement, which sought to maintain neutrality during the Cold War and promote cooperation between developing countries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on unity and progress among Asian and African countries aligns with the goals of the Green Revolution, which aimed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce poverty in developing nations. The other options do not directly relate to the themes mentioned in the passage.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both laws mentioned in the passages were enacted to restrict immigration from specific countries, namely China and India. These restrictions were not related to religious conversions or industrialization but rather a response to concerns about labor competition and social order during periods of colonial expansion. The most appropriate answer is European and American colonial domination of India and China.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The immigration laws described in the passages were likely a response to European and American colonial domination in India and China, as these powers sought to control the movement of people and resources within their empires. This is supported by the fact that both acts specifically targeted Chinese laborers, who had been brought to work on plantations or railroads under indentured contracts during this period.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of new crops and plants from America, such as wheat, peaches, pears, oranges, lemons, chickpeas, grapevines, melons, onions, radishes, etc., would have increased the diversity of available food sources in Europe. This greater variety likely led to improved nutrition and a more stable food supply, which could support a larger population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The large-scale export of crops from the New World to Europe likely resulted in food shortages and famine, leading to a decline in the European population. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the population declined because of famine caused by mass export of crops.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the negative impact of opium on mankind and criticizes Europe for exporting it to China, despite its prohibition in their own country. This suggests a focus on economic exploitation rather than colonization or enslavement. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is related to Europe's economic domination of China.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's condemnation of the opium trade suggests that it was seen as a form of enslavement, with Europeans forcing the Chinese population into addiction and dependence. This is indicative of economic domination rather than colonization or missionary activity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is related to Europe's economic domination of China.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text refers to Mahatma Gandhi encouraging Indians to boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving, which aligns with his broader goal of self-rule (Swaraj) and independence from British rule. This was part of the Swadeshi movement that aimed at promoting Indian goods while rejecting foreign products.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the passage likely reflects Indian labor's efforts to improve working conditions and gain greater rights through collective action. Gandhi encourages Indians, both men and women, to completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute as a means of self-reliance and resistance against British colonial rule.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided does not mention any direct interaction between Persia and Arabia during 600-1450 C.E., nor does it discuss control, support for client states or being brought into the Arabian orbit. However, given that this period includes the rise of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula (7th century) which eventually led to Persia's conquest by Muslim forces and its incorporation into the Islamic Caliphate, it can be inferred that Persia was brought into the Arabian orbit over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages highlight the religious justifications used for warfare, with one source advocating for the spread of Islam through jihad and the other depicting peaceful interactions between Christians and Muslims. However, these sources do not provide direct information about Persia's relationship with Arabia during 600-1450 C.E. The correct answer should reflect historical events in this period.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Western Europe achieved global hegemony through exploiting ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets outside its lands. Among the options provided, the conquest of the Aztec Empire (B) best supports this assertion as it involved the acquisition of vast territories with rich natural resources and labor force in the Americas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes the need for resource exploitation from other continents, and Japan's isolationist policies during the Tokugawa period would have provided ample opportunity for such exploitation by Western Europe. This aligns with Crosby's assertion that geographical and ecological luck played a role in European hegemony.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to change Russia and provide both direction and motive force for its transformation, even if it meant using education, persuasion, or coercion. There is no mention of creating an elected assembly (A), declarations of human rights (B), or developing a constitutional monarchy (C). However, the passage does imply that he aimed to reduce aristocratic influence by taking control and leading the transformation himself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to drive Russia forward and his willingness to use force suggest a desire to dismantle the existing power structures, including the aristocracy, in order to implement his reforms. The passage does not mention any intention of creating an elected assembly or developing a constitutional monarchy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the obligation of jihad and how Muslim rulers should prosecute it, while the second passage describes interactions between Christians and Muslim hermits in a peaceful manner. These passages highlight the influence of religious beliefs on both conflict (through jihad) and cooperation (peaceful treatment of hermits). Therefore, they best illustrate how religion impacted interactions between different cultures during that time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription clearly demonstrates Persia's strong influence and authority in the region, suggesting that their military and political power would have extended to Arabia throughout the period. This dominance likely facilitated trade routes and cultural exchanges between the two regions, as well as influenced religious practices and beliefs.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Moreland describes how revenue collection varied across different regions, with some chiefs and tribes paying taxes while others were in open rebellion or enjoyed practical independence due to inconvenience for Mughal authorities. This indicates that geographical differences influenced the groups who paid taxes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of revenue collection for the Mughal Empire's functioning, implying that it was the primary, if not the only, means by which the empire sustained itself financially. It also mentions how some chiefs and tribes had an 'anomalous position,' sometimes paying taxes, rebelling, or enjoying independence due to inconvenience for Mughal authorities.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the exercise of power and control over native populations in India during British rule, with a focus on maintaining order and subordination through various means such as prohibiting certain practices or controlling trade. The context is about colonial administrative decisions affecting Indian society.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the mobilization of military resources was a key strategy employed by colonial powers. The first passage talks about suppressing sati in India while considering the safety of the British Empire, indicating an exercise of administrative power. However, it also emphasizes the importance of keeping Indians subordinate and dependent on goods from Britain, which aligns more closely with maintaining control over resources and populations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of women retiring late, rising early, performing domestic duties, and maintaining purity in spirit. It also mentions that a woman should attend to her own affairs and continue ancestral worship. These expectations highlight obedience and fulfillment of obligations within the home.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman's role in supporting her husband and maintaining a harmonious household, suggesting a collaborative approach to domestic tasks and responsibilities. It also highlights virtues such as correctness, upright character, purity, and orderliness.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno, the Indonesian leader, was addressing the Bandung Conference in 1955 and discussing the importance of peace for Asia and Africa during a time when many countries were trying to maintain neutrality amidst global conflicts. The Cold War (choice C) is the most fitting context as it involved ideological tensions between the US and USSR, with Asian and African nations often caught in the middle, attempting to remain non-aligned.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on peace and the mobilization of Asian and African nations suggests a direct response to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and its destabilizing effects on the region. The other options, while significant events during that time period, do not directly involve Asia and Africa as much as the Arab-Israeli conflict.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech emphasizes the need to overcome backwardness in various aspects, including military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural sectors. This aligns with Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy, which aimed at rapid industrialization and modernization.",C,Let's reason step by step. Stalin's focus on rapid industrialization and his fear of falling behind suggest a strong motivation to develop nuclear weapons as a means of ensuring the Soviet Union's security and dominance on the world stage. This aligns with historical events during that time period.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the governance and control over Indian territories during colonial times, with a focus on maintaining order and ensuring subordination through various means. The first passage refers to William Bentinck's role as Governor-General of India, indicating direct rule by the crown. However, George Simpson's statement about ruling Indians 'with a rod of iron' and their dependence on goods sold by Western powers suggests an indirect form of control where companies play a significant role in governance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages emphasize the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the imposition of martial law and the presence of large armies were common colonial techniques. However, George Simpson specifically mentions the Hudson's Bay Company, which was a chartered company given authority to govern certain territories in exchange for sharing profits with the crown.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The tone of King Afonso I's letter expresses concern over his people being kidnapped and sold to Europeans, indicating a negative impact from European presence in their kingdom. This suggests resistance against the exploitation caused by European expeditions rather than dependence on trade or establishment of trading posts.",B,Let's reason step by step. The king's complaints about the kidnapping of his people and their sale into slavery indicate a strong resistance against European attempts to conquer and colonize the region. This shows that there was vigorous opposition from African leaders towards European expeditions.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal, dividing newly discovered lands outside Europe along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. This division allowed Portugal to claim territories east of the line, which included routes to India via the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. The Portuguese were interested in establishing trade with Asia and securing valuable spices and goods.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese were known for their pursuit of wealth and resources, and the lands of Mexico, with their abundant gold and silver, would have been a highly desirable territory for them to control. This aligns with the Treaty of Tordesillas which aimed at dividing newly discovered territories between Spain and Portugal.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that zamindars were landowners who paid revenue to the Mogul, indicating their position of dependence and potential claim to sovereignty. Considering the historical context of Northern India during the Mughal Empire, which was predominantly Muslim, it is most likely that these zamindars belonged to a religious group present in the region at that time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in the context of land and revenue, and since peasants are typically associated with agricultural activities and land cultivation, it's reasonable to assume that zamindars were a type of peasant class within the Mughal Empire. Additionally, considering the historical context of Northern India during the Mughal period, Hinduism was prevalent among the local population.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects on the meaning of life and acknowledges the limitations in understanding a transcendental purpose, emphasizing human terms as the only comprehensible context. This perspective aligns with modernist themes that often question traditional belief systems and explore existential concerns.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the devastation and loss of faith caused by World War II, many people turned back to traditional religious values for comfort and guidance, and Camus' exploration of meaning and the human condition reflects this trend. The passage does not express patriotic pride or embrace radical Marxism, nor does it question faith-based moralities but rather acknowledges a lack of understanding.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of the Roman Empire was influenced by various factors, including civil wars between rivals for the throne (A), incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire (B), and demographic weakness due to diseases and epidemics (D). However, the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire (C) was not a contributing factor to its decline; instead, it continued to function throughout the later years of the Roman Empire.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the constant threat posed by barbarian incursions and intertribal conflicts, suggesting that these external pressures were the main cause of the Roman Empire's decline. Civil wars between rivals for the throne also weakened the empire internally. Demographic weakness due to diseases and epidemics further contributed to its downfall. However, the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire is not mentioned as a contributing factor to the decline.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'quantum jump' mentioned refers to a significant increase in productivity, which would have allowed Western Europe to exploit resources and achieve global hegemony. This increased productivity likely led to more efficient agricultural practices, resulting in more plentiful food supplies and thus an increase in the world population during 1450-1750 C.E.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The exploitation of resources and the rapid increase in productivity often lead to social unrest and inequality, as different groups compete for access to wealth and power. In this context, Western Europe's 'quantum jump' likely exacerbated existing tensions and created new ones within societies affected by its expansion.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both Source 1 (Martin Luther King Jr.'s letter) and Source 2 (National Organization for Women Statement of Purpose) emphasize the importance of taking concrete action to achieve their goals, rather than just discussing or debating them. Martin Luther King Jr. talks about creating tension through nonviolent direct action to force a community to confront issues it has been ignoring. Similarly, NOW states that 'the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument...to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying equality.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. All three sources advocate for social justice and equality, and achieving such goals often requires building alliances and solidarity with other movements fighting for similar causes. Source 1 emphasizes the importance of nonviolent direct action to create tension that forces a community to confront issues it has been ignoring. Similarly, Source 2 calls for concrete actions beyond discussions to achieve true equality for women in America. Both sources implicitly suggest the need for unity with other movements as they seek change.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from the Upanishads discusses understanding, mindfulness, and purity as means to reach a place where one is not reborn again, which aligns with Hindu beliefs about moksha (liberation). Buddhism also shares the concept of karma affecting rebirth. Therefore, among the given options, the most similar aspect between Hinduism and early Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation would be retaining the concept of karma.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach about reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of this cycle of rebirth is to reach a state of enlightenment and ascend to a heavenly realm. The concept of karma plays an essential role in both religions as it determines one's fate in future lives based on their actions in the current life.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the dilemma of continuing or discontinuing sati, highlighting the horror of allowing innocent victims to die and the potential risk to British authority in India if they intervene. It concludes with a preference for an open prohibition due to Britain's supreme position at that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The British were predominantly Christian and often sought to spread their religion in their colonies, so their opposition to the sati ritual likely stemmed from a desire to convert the Indian population to Christianity. However, William Bentinck specifically mentions that discontinuing the practice of sati would not put at risk the safety of the British Empire in India and he is 'decidedly in favour' of prohibition. This suggests that their primary motivation was ending what they considered an inhumane practice without endangering their own authority.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Maynard Keynes, a twentieth-century economist, is known for his belief in government intervention to stabilize the economy and maintain aggregate demand during economic downturns. In response to Bismarck's evaluation of workers facing insecurities such as unemployment, illness, and old age, Keynes would likely suggest that society address these issues through active government policies aimed at supporting those in need.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Keynes generally cautioned against excessive government intervention in the economy, believing that market forces should play a primary role in regulating economic activity. However, he also recognized the importance of addressing social issues such as poverty and unemployment through public policy measures when necessary.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text emphasizes the importance of truth, moral behavior, and adherence to divine ordinances for a favorable outcome in life and after death. It suggests that those guided by gods will not lose themselves and those forbidden passage won't cross the river of life, implying consequences based on one's actions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text clearly emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, suggesting that ancient Egyptians were deeply committed to elaborate rituals and offerings to appease their gods. It also implies a belief in divine guidance and consequences for wrongdoing, which aligns with religious influence on societal values.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I mentions the 'Faith of God the Beneficent', which is a reference to Islam, and specifically refers to Sunni consensus. Additionally, it quotes the Prophet Muhammad (Peace upon him!), indicating that this empire follows the teachings of Islam. Therefore, the religious tradition best characterizing the empire founded by Ismail I would be Shi'a Islam.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the removal of ""evil innovation,"" which aligns with the Sikh tradition of extirpating hair as a way to dedicate oneself to God. Additionally, Ismail I was the founder of the Safavid dynasty in Persia (modern-day Iran), known for establishing Shi'a Islam as the state religion.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Europe and China developed different military strategies based on their unique threats, with Europe focusing on gunpowder weaponry due to prolonged sieges while China improved horse archer units for mobility against nomads. This difference in technological development contributed to the eventual military superiority of European states over non-Western powers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly compares the different approaches to gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, highlighting how societies strategically shared and adapted technologies based on their specific needs. It discusses how European states developed cannons for sieges while China focused on improving horse archer units due to threats from mobile nomads.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'what the world whispers' in this context refers to how the rest of the world perceives and reacts to apartheid, which is a system of institutionalized racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s. Given the poem's overall tone and content, it suggests that while many may be aware or disapprove of the atrocities happening under apartheid, they do not openly oppose it due to fear or other reasons.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poet contrasts the world's quiet disapproval of apartheid with South Africa's blatant actions, suggesting that the global economic system indirectly promotes and benefits from South Africa's discrimination. Therefore, 'what the world whispers' refers to how the international community subtly supports or ignores such oppressive systems.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the former kings cultivated their virtue, which led to tranquility and prosperity under Heaven's favor. However, it also mentions that calamities were sent down due to a lack of following this example, indicating that the ruler had lost the blessing of the gods or the Mandate of Heaven.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the former kings of Xia faced calamities due to their lack of virtue. This implies that the current ruler, who inherited their legacy, likely met a similar fate as a result of natural disasters. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how people can be ungrateful, fickle, and false when it comes to their loyalty towards a ruler. It emphasizes that fear is more reliable than love in maintaining control over subjects because obligations based on love are easily broken for personal gain. This reflects the author's cynical view of people's loyalty.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's argument about the importance of fear over love in maintaining control clearly reflects a criticism of the religious establishment's reliance on faith and devotion, which he sees as unreliable tools for governance. He emphasizes that people are fickle, false, and driven by self-interest rather than loyalty or moral obligation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for evidence that contradicts the argument of rigid caste system roles in Indian society during 600 BCE to 600 CE. Option C provides an example where a person from a lower social class (fisherwoman) could rise and achieve greatness, thus challenging the idea of fixed economic and social roles.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Krishna, mentioning four divisions created by him, reinforces the idea of a rigid caste system where individuals are born into specific roles with limited social mobility. This statement does not contradict but rather supports the argument that the caste system imposed strict economic and social roles.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the text refers to Gandhi's call for Indians to boycott foreign cloth and embrace spinning or weaving, which was part of the Swadeshi movement during India's struggle for independence from British rule. World War II (D) significantly weakened Britain economically and militarily, making it difficult for them to maintain control over their colonies, including India. This historical development most likely assisted in the success of Gandhi's boycott.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott's success was undoubtedly influenced by the decolonization process already underway in Africa, as it inspired and empowered Indians to resist colonial rule and demand independence. However, World War II had a more direct impact on India's struggle for freedom. During the war, Britain needed Indian support against Axis powers, which led them to make concessions towards Indian demands, including granting limited self-governance in 1942 through the Cripps Mission and eventually leading to independence in 1947.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a situation where Bonesteel is trying to establish a surrender zone in Korea that would be acceptable to the Russians while preventing them from seizing all of Korea. This indicates a delicate balance and negotiation between the United States and the Soviets, suggesting an uneasy alliance rather than close cooperation or outright hostility.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly depicts the US and Soviets working together to manage the surrender of Japanese forces, demonstrating their close collaboration and shared goals as comrades-in-arms. However, there is also an underlying tension due to concerns about Soviet intentions in Korea.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights that while Western Europe invested in gunpowder weaponry, China focused on improving horse archer units due to their specific military needs against mobile steppe nomads. This challenges the traditional view of technological progress being linear and uniform across societies. Among the options provided, option B suggests that China's dictatorial rule suppressed innovation, which is not supported by the passage as it shows a strategic choice rather than suppression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archers over gunpowder was a strategic choice based on their specific threats. This challenges the view that China's progress was hindered by religious fundamentalism, which often opposes technological advancements. Instead, it shows that China made deliberate decisions in response to its unique circumstances.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker emphasizes the importance of unity among African states, common purpose, planning and endeavor to overcome the consequences of colonial rule. This focus on continental solidarity and cooperation aligns with Pan-Africanism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's call for African unity highlights the limitations of individual states and emphasizes the need for collaboration, suggesting a neocolonial approach where African nations work together under the guidance of former colonial powers. However, his focus on common purpose, planning, and endeavor indicates an aspiration to overcome these constraints.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation mentions 'going beyond this life', which implies an expectation of an afterlife, where one can meet Brahman again if they have faith and doubts not.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's belief in an afterlife and the emphasis on faith suggest that salvation in this religion is achieved through right actions and right speech, earning favor with the gods. This aligns with Hinduism, which values dharma (righteousness) as a path to spiritual growth.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck, in his speech, highlighted the worker's grievances regarding job security, health concerns, and lack of support during old age or illness. The passage suggests that society did not recognize any obligation towards workers beyond basic help for the poor. This led to the creation of laws aiming at providing social protection for workers in terms of health care and pensions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's concern for worker insecurity and the lack of social safety nets clearly indicates that the resulting laws aimed to limit work hours in factories, providing workers with more stability and protection. This aligns best with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem reflects an appreciation and connection to New York, which suggests that the poet is influenced by transatlantic cultural exchanges between Afro-Eurasia and the Americas. This influence likely stems from historical connections such as migration, trade, and shared artistic movements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet's lyrical portrayal of New York likely stems from the outmigration of Africans escaping political violence and seeking new opportunities in the United States, leading to a blending of cultural influences. This migration allowed African intellectuals like Senghor to experience Western culture firsthand and express their perspectives through art.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The third stanza discusses the difficulty for Shanxi men to pay land tax due to their conscription into military service, implying that there is a need for conscripted soldiers rather than a professional standing army. This suggests that the Tang Dynasty relied on conscription as part of its military strategy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of widespread conscription and tax collection suggests a relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, with a large population concentrated in cities, necessitating a strong bureaucracy for efficient administration. This is evident from the mention of 'district officers,' who are responsible for collecting land taxes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty was signed in 1949, shortly after World War II, during a time when tensions between Western countries and the Soviet Union were rising (the beginning of the Cold War). This treaty aimed to provide collective defense against potential aggression from opposing states. Article 5 specifically mentions that an armed attack on one member would be considered an attack on all members, indicating mutual protection as a primary reason for signing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty's emphasis on collective defense and the potential use of armed force suggests that it was signed in response to the monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities held by certain nations, prompting others to form an alliance for protection. This aligns with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which recognizes the right of individual or collective self-defense.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to a historical context where the 'Winter King', Frederick V, lost his throne in Bohemia and was forced into exile after being defeated at the Battle of White Mountain. Rhine and Prague are mentioned as places he must avoid due to their significance within the Holy Roman Empire, which Ferdinand II now ruled.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator's reference to Rhine and Prague suggests these are significant locations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage, possibly seeking redemption or spiritual guidance after his defeat. This is supported by the context of asking him to go to Ferdinand, who is Bohemia's lawful king.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages from John of Damascus and the Second Council of Nicaea emphasize the importance and use of holy images in religious practices, particularly within Christianity. Among the given options, Sunni Islam is known for its opposition to the depiction of human figures in religious contexts due to concerns about idolatry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages advocate for the use of holy images as tools for religious understanding, which directly contradicts the principles of Buddhism, a religion that emphasizes meditation and inner reflection over external representations. Sunni Islam also opposes the use of images in worship due to aniconism, but it is not explicitly mentioned among the options.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The United Nations, as mentioned in Article 1 and Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, is focused on settling disputes peacefully, promoting friendly relations between nations, and assisting parties under attack to maintain security. This aligns with providing avenues for arbitration of disputes among nations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of the United Nations in the treaty suggests it is an organization dedicated to asserting a particular ideological tenet over the world, promoting its values and principles as the basis for international relations. However, the specific articles mentioned focus on peaceful dispute resolution, refraining from force inconsistent with UN purposes, and collective self-defense in case of armed attack. This aligns more closely with an organization providing avenues of arbitration for disputes among nations.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation describes Brahman as encompassing all aspects of existence ('all works and desires', 'all perfumes and tastes'), containing the universe within him, and being present in silence with love for everything. This suggests that Brahman is omnipresent and not confined to a specific location or form.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Brahman as a spirit residing within the hearts of individuals, suggesting that he is found in a specific location, similar to the concept of Heaven in other religions. However, it also states that 'He enfolds the whole universe', indicating an omnipresence and universality beyond just human hearts or heavenly realms.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights that under the Mongol Empire, various cultures and religions coexisted peacefully, with an emphasis on tolerance and international contact facilitated through secure trade routes. This description aligns closely with option A, which states that both empires allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of various religions and their vast empire encompassed diverse belief systems, likely leading to the creation of a new syncretic religion. On the other hand, Persian Empire was historically associated with Zoroastrianism, an ancient monotheistic religion that remained prevalent throughout its history.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The verse mentions 'a burst of saxophone laughter,' which is a reference to jazz music, and the overall vibrant and imaginative description aligns with the spirit of the Jazz Age. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the Jazz Age.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on nature, emotions, and vivid imagery aligns with the core principles of the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism and a connection to the natural world. However, references to jazz music (e.g., 'burst of saxophone laughter') suggest an influence from The Jazz Age, a period known for its cultural innovation in music, particularly jazz.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther, in his letter to the Christian Nobility of Germany, criticizes the Roman Catholic Church for its corruption and abuse of power, particularly regarding indulgences, papal authority, and worldly pomp. John Wycliffe was an early reformer who also challenged the church's practices, including the sale of indulgences and questioning the Pope's authority over Scripture interpretation. His views align closely with those expressed by Luther.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther were key figures in the Protestant Reformation and challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, so their views must have been similar. Sir Thomas More was a staunch defender of the Catholic Church against the Reformation, while Erasmus criticized certain practices but remained within the church's framework. John Wycliffe predated Luther by about 150 years and shared many reformist ideas that influenced later Protestant thinkers.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sacrificial ritual involving Purusa and how different elements of society were born from it. It highlights the significance of sacrifice in creating various aspects of life and establishes its role as an essential practice for the gods.,C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sacrifice that leads to the creation of the world and different castes, suggesting that good deeds and sacrifices are essential for achieving enlightenment and improving one's karma. Therefore, this passage can be used to explain the emphasis on karma or right actions in Hinduism.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects on the search for meaning in a world that may not inherently possess it, and emphasizes understanding through human terms. This existential questioning aligns with Existentialism, which focuses on individual existence, freedom, and choice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's questioning of meaning and the nature of existence aligns with the principles of New Age syncretism, which seeks to blend various spiritual and philosophical perspectives. Albert Camus is known for his exploration of absurdity and existential themes in his works.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a brutal extermination of the Bructeri people, which is an example of how civilized societies treated barbarian peoples between 600 BCE and 600 CE. Among the given options, option D reflects a similar treatment where inviting barbarians to rule instead of their own ruling classes could lead to conflict or extermination.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the conflict between barbarian tribes and the Roman Empire, suggesting that barbarian peoples were often converted to Christianity as part of their integration into Roman society. This mirrors the treatment of barbarian peoples in the period 600-1450 C.E., where conversion to the dominant religion was a common practice for assimilation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given information mentions a British citizen who had insured his property and was concerned about damage caused by natives during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. This suggests that European citizens were already present in Zulu lands before this time, likely due to colonial expansion efforts rather than trade ports or diamond rushes. The Berlin Conference took place later (in 1884), so it could not have influenced the movement of Europeans to Zulu lands in 1867.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference established clear boundaries and regulations for European colonization in Africa, making it easier for Europeans to move to Zulu lands and establish settlements. This conference aimed at avoiding conflicts between European powers over African territories.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Olympe de Gouges wrote her 'Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen' in 1791, advocating for women's rights during the French Revolution. However, despite this early push for equality, it took a long time before significant progress was made towards political rights for women in France. The correct answer is that French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the disappointment and frustration of women who had hoped for greater equality after the French Revolution, suggesting that their status actually declined as they faced continued discrimination and exclusion from political life. This indicates that full political rights were not granted to them in the immediate aftermath.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to the Winter King, who snatched the Kaiser's crown and is now being urged to seek pardon from Ferdinand, Bohemia's lawful king. This situation indicates a conflict over rightful royal succession.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The song's mocking tone and criticism of the ""Winter King"" suggest underlying social class conflicts and resentment towards the privileges and authority of the ruling elite. It emphasizes that only Ferdinand, presumably from a higher social status or royal lineage, can be Bohemia's lawful king.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem speaks of the resilience, history, and cultural richness of America with references to its poets, ancient civilizations, and religious beliefs. It also emphasizes that despite facing numerous challenges, it continues to thrive on love and dreams. This theme aligns best with option B: Latin America has survived many invaders and will endure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem acknowledges the power and influence of the United States while emphasizing the resilience of Latin American culture, suggesting that change and progress are inevitable, even if they come through external forces. However, it also highlights the enduring spirit and identity of Latin America despite these challenges.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, in the passage, emphasizes the importance of African unity and political union to project a strong African personality on the world stage. He also criticizes the disregard for African independence by Great Powers. These ideas align with Pan-Africanism, which advocates for solidarity among all people of African descent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's emphasis on African unity and self-determination aligns with the principles of neocolonialism, which sought to maintain European influence in Africa through economic and political partnerships. His call for a political union and projecting an 'African personality' reflects the desire to break free from colonial powers while still engaging with them on equal terms.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a ruler who recognizes and rewards Sanehat for his military successes, placing him at the head of his sons due to his valor and achievements. This indicates that meritocratic appointments based on individual accomplishments were valued in Egyptian society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a champion representing his tribe and seeking to take the narrator's cattle, indicating that clans were the basic political units in Egyptian society and played a significant role in conflicts and rivalries. This suggests that decisions and actions were often influenced by tribal affiliations.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions were influenced by a movement that emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority. This period saw significant advancements in philosophy, science, and politics, which directly contributed to the ideas behind these revolutions. Among the given options, 'the Enlightenment' best represents this intellectual foundation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were influenced by the principles of mercantilism, which emphasized economic competition and the accumulation of wealth through trade and colonization. However, the intellectual foundations for these political revolutions primarily stemmed from Enlightenment ideas that advocated for individual rights, reason, and social contract theory.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese traders traveling from Macao to Japan, carrying goods like silk, gold, musk, porcelain, etc., and bringing back silver. This indicates that they were actively participating in East Asian trade patterns, exchanging European goods for valuable commodities such as Japanese silver.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese trade route between Macao and Japan, highlighting the exchange of goods and the presence of Portuguese merchants, which suggests the influence of Jesuit missionaries who often accompanied traders and facilitated cultural exchange. This indicates European participation in East Asian trade patterns.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage primarily focuses on the hypocrisy of selling opium, which is banned in Britain due to its harmful effects, to China while causing injuries there. It emphasizes that if it's considered too dangerous for their own country, they should not transfer it to another.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes China's economic and moral superiority over Britain, suggesting that Britain should fear the potential military consequences of its harmful opium trade and China's righteous anger. This argument is based on a perceived power imbalance between the two nations.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a situation where there are limited regulations on business and working conditions, with children being allowed to work due to necessity despite poor wages and treatment. This scenario aligns most closely with the laissez-faire style of government, which advocates for minimal interference in economic affairs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system with minimal government intervention in business and labor practices, aligning with the principles of corporatism, where the state and corporations work together to regulate the economy and social affairs. However, among the given options, laissez-faire is most closely associated with limited regulations on businesses and working conditions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how mine owners exploit and mistreat indigenous people, forcing them into labor without pay or proper compensation for their work. This system results in the Indians becoming poor and indebted to the mine owners. It highlights a form of social stratification based on origin of birth where the native population is subjected to harsh conditions while benefiting the elites.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in Spanish South American mines, indicating that the king of Spain was likely unaware of or unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects in the colonies. This is supported by the mention of corruption among colonial officials who collude with mine owners to maintain their oppressive practices.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the French Revolution and the American Revolution were driven by a desire for change in their respective societies, particularly regarding governance and representation. The most fitting answer is that both revolutions were responses to unfair systems of taxation, which caused widespread discontent among the populace.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were fueled by discontent with the power and influence of religious leaders, who often held significant political and economic authority, similar to the challenges posed during the Protestant Reformation. This shared aspect is evident in both revolutions as they sought to limit or eliminate the Church's control over governance.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar was a key figure in the Latin American independence movement, and his message to the Congress of Angostura reflects on the challenges faced by newly independent nations. The passage does not mention any specific military victory or coup but rather discusses the broader issues related to liberty, governance, and morality. Among the given options, Bol\u00edvar is best known for his role in promoting unity among Latin American states.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes Simón Bolívar's mixed-race identity and his struggle against both Spanish rule and native resistance, suggesting that he likely led a political coup to challenge the existing power structures and assert the rights of mixed-race individuals. This aligns with historical accounts of Bolívar leading efforts for independence in Latin America.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta was a traveler and explorer who visited various regions, including Aden in Yemen. Zheng He and Marco Polo were also famous travelers and explorers of their time, while Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India for religious purposes. Lorenzo de Medici, however, was an Italian statesman and patron of the arts during the Renaissance period in Florence, Italy, with no known extensive travel experiences like Ibn Battuta.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. Marco Polo was also a famous explorer whose accounts of his travels in Asia bear some resemblance to Ibn Battuta's observations. Xuanzang, like Ibn Battuta, traveled extensively for religious purposes, experiencing various cultures and societies along the way. Lorenzo de Medici, however, was a prominent Italian statesman and patron of arts during the Renaissance period who did not travel as extensively or document his experiences in the same manner.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author argues that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment through their exploitation and manipulation of the continent's resources. Among the options, the establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company (C) directly involves Western European capitalists in the colonization and resource extraction from Africa, which aligns with Rodney's assertion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. However, Rodney specifically mentions Western European capitalists as responsible for underdevelopment in Africa. Therefore, we need to find an option that involves Western Europeans and their actions directly impacting Africa's resources or economy. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company (a Western European entity) involved direct control over African land and resources, which aligns with Rodney's assertion.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses a struggle against both native inhabitants and foreign invaders, as well as issues of liberty, slavery, and deception. These themes align with Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar's efforts to liberate South American countries from Spanish colonial rule during the early 19th century.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text clearly describes a population seeking self-governance and resisting external control, aligning with the concept of political autonomy. Additionally, Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar was a key figure in South America's fight for independence from Spanish rule during the early 19th century. The context provided by his message to Congress and the specific references to struggles against invaders and natives further support this connection.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how neighboring tribes, possibly under imperial encouragement or favorable regard from fortune (which could be interpreted as divine support), exterminated the Bructeri. This suggests that empires may have promoted rivalries among barbarian peoples to reduce threats and conflicts against themselves.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that empires benefited from the influx of barbarian peoples who could contribute to the empire's workforce and economic growth. It mentions how these tribes were driven out, exterminated, or displaced due to various reasons such as hatred for their tyranny, attractions of plunder, or favorable regard from heaven.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The chart shows a steady increase in literacy rates from 1897 to 1955 under both Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union. A historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would likely focus on the significant improvements made during this period, despite potential abuses or shortcomings of Leninist and Stalinist regimes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The dramatic rise in literacy rates suggests that the Soviet Union's communist system was more effective in achieving its goals compared to other communist nations like China. This increase can be attributed to the government's focus on education and eradicating illiteracy, which aligns with the ideals of a communist society.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii expressed concerns about the potential threat posed by Western powers due to their technological advancements, military efficiency, and formidable power. In response to these concerns during this era, Japan initiated a period of rapid modernization known as the Meiji Restoration. This included sending emissaries abroad to study western democracies and industry in order to strengthen its own nation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To address the concerns about foreign powers, Japan likely needed to completely reform its outdated systems, starting with the Chinese-style civil service. This would allow them to modernize and compete effectively on a global scale.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) were enacted to restrict immigration based on nationality, race or occupation. These acts reflect a period in history where there was an increasing desire among certain nations to limit the influx of foreigners perceived as threats to social order and economic stability.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the selective nature of immigration policies, aiming to attract skilled workers while restricting the entry of unskilled laborers. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both demonstrate a desire to control the type of immigrants entering their respective countries, focusing on skilled workers while excluding others.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E., as recorded by Robert the Monk, was primarily focused on addressing the invasion and occupation of Christian lands by a foreign power. The Seljuk Turks had invaded Anatolia, which led to the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos requesting military assistance from Western Europe. This event directly inspired Urban's call for aid in his speech.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire. However, Pope Urban II was addressing his speech in 1095 C.E., which is after these events occurred. The Seljuk Turks' invasion of Anatolia during this period threatened Christian lands and led to calls for help from Constantinople, making it a more immediate concern.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong discusses the need to eliminate the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in favor of cooperation, which implies collective ownership and management of agricultural resources. This approach aims at improving living conditions for all rural people together through socialist transformation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The socialist transformation likely involved a shift of agricultural workforce towards industrial centers, contributing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This process would have allowed for increased investment in modernizing both industry and agriculture.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The rural peasantry, being largely illiterate and having limited access to education historically, would have benefited most from rising literacy rates as it would provide them with better opportunities for social mobility, understanding of political changes, and improved quality of life.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Increased literacy would greatly benefit the clergy, allowing them to better interpret and disseminate religious texts and teachings to the population. The Russian Orthodox Church played a significant role in society during this period, making it likely that members of the clergy would have benefited most from rising literacy rates.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a ruler who values and promotes Sanehat due to his military successes against outsiders, which led to victories and conquests. In early civilizations, such achievements were often seen as evidence of the leader's ability and favor from the gods, thus granting legitimacy to their rule.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflicts between states primarily served to provide the victors with a source of slaves and resources, which were crucial for sustaining their agricultural systems and economies. The Tale of Sanehat exemplifies this through the depiction of capturing cattle and inhabitants.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the virtues and duties expected from a woman in ancient patriarchal societies, including correctness in manner, upright character, domestic responsibilities, and ancestral worship. Among these themes, female purity is highlighted as an essential aspect of her role to serve her husband and maintain order within the household.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage underscores the importance of women fulfilling their roles in maintaining the household and upholding ancestral traditions through rituals and offerings. Among these, it emphasizes living a pure life, attending to domestic duties, and continuing ancestral worship. While all options are mentioned, the theme that is most consistently highlighted throughout the passage as common in patriarchal ancient societies is female purity.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The U.S. concern over limiting Soviet occupation of Korean territory aligns with the policy aimed at preventing the spread of communism and restricting Soviet influence during the Cold War. This objective is consistent with the containment strategy, which sought to stop the expansion of Soviet power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concern over Soviet expansion aligns with the Cold War strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, where the threat of retaliation deterred aggressive actions. However, this policy does not directly address territorial concerns in Korea. Dollar Diplomacy is related to economic influence rather than military or political containment. Detente refers to a relaxation of tensions and doesn't specifically aim at limiting Soviet occupation. Containment was the U.S. strategy during the Cold War that sought to prevent the spread of communism, which includes limiting Soviet territorial expansion in Korea.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Winston Churchill's speech emphasizes determination and resilience in the face of adversity, specifically mentioning fighting on various terrains against an unnamed enemy. Given that Adolf Hitler had recently declared war on Poland (Source 1), it is clear that Nazi Germany was a significant threat to Britain at this time. The context of Churchill's speech aligns with British fears about a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. The context of his speech, which emphasizes fighting on various fronts and never surrendering, suggests a focus on strengthening their defense rather than supporting resistance movements or appeasing the enemy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph are primarily focused on Portuguese traders who used to carry goods from Macao and Japan to China, while bringing silver back from these regions. This system was disrupted when a new power took control of India, which was an important source of silver for the Portuguese. Among the given options, only the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (1603-1868) had significant impact on trade patterns by restricting foreign influence and limiting European traders' access to Japanese ports.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and subsequent control over trade routes in the Pacific likely disrupted the established trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan. This would have affected the Portuguese ability to bring silver from Japan for their advantageous trades with China.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage describes a situation where Christians show kindness to Muslim hermits and do not hinder Christian merchants in Muslim territories during the crusading era, which contradicts the common perception of constant hostility between Christians and Muslims at that time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims. This contradicts traditional assumptions about state-level hostilities being reflected in personal or economic interactions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the dilemma faced by William Bentinck, Governor-General of India, regarding whether or not to continue the practice of sati (a Hindu funeral custom where a widow immolates herself on her husband's pyre). He acknowledges that stopping this practice would prevent innocent victims from suffering but also considers the potential impact on British control in India. This passage challenges the assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to impose their cultural norms, as Bentinck weighs both moral and political considerations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage demonstrates that European colonizers often intervened in the religious practices of native populations, as seen in the example of the suppression of sati. This intervention was driven by moral considerations and a sense of responsibility rather than solely for profit or cultural imposition.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The instructions in the fifth paragraph emphasize boycotting foreign cloth and promoting Swadeshi, which refers to using goods produced within one's own country. During 1450-1750 C.E., joint-stock companies like the British East India Company were established, leading to increased trade between Britain and India, including textiles. This development likely inspired Gandhi's call for boycotting foreign cloth as a means of promoting Indian industry and self-reliance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The call to boycott foreign cloth likely drew inspiration from the historical experience of India under the rule of Muslim empires, where local industries suffered due to competition from imported goods. This context aligns with Gandhi's emphasis on Swadeshi (self-sufficiency) and economic independence.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage discusses how the Cawnpore Massacre was an indigenous response to British rule, which had established itself through violence and treated Indians as inferior beings. It highlights that the revolt shattered the monopoly of violence held by the British, suggesting that the massacre can be seen as a reaction against systemic oppression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the Cawnpore Massacre was a brutal event, it might be understood within the context of local military customs and traditions, which may differ from Western norms. The passage does not explicitly state that the massacre was justifiable or praiseworthy; instead, it highlights the violence inherent in British rule and how the revolt shattered their monopoly on violence by matching official alien violence with indigenous resistance.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby discusses the exploitation of ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets in other continents to achieve global hegemony through increased productivity. This is most closely related to the colonization efforts where Western Europeans established control over vast territories outside their own lands.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby's argument likely refers to the Industrial Revolution, where European nations needed vast resources and markets to fuel their industrial growth, leading to the exploitation of other continents. This period saw Western Europe expand its influence through colonization and resource extraction.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the local Yakut and Tungus natives were forced to pay yasak tribute, initially in sables or red foxes, but now there are no sables and not many foxes left due to overhunting. Additionally, many of them cannot hunt because they have lost their horses, which have been pawned off to the yasak collectors.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline in fur-bearing animals likely resulted from competition with Russian hunters and trappers who also sought these valuable resources, making it difficult for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. Additionally, the loss of horses due to pawning them off to yasak collectors further hindered hunting efforts.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 is a quote from Vladimir Illyich Lenin, who was the leader of the Bolshevik Party and a key figure in the Russian Revolution. The text emphasizes seizing power for the sake of revolutionary change, aligning with the interests of the Soviets (workers' councils), and addressing issues like peace, famine, and land distribution to peasants. These ideas are consistent with Marxist philosophy, which advocates for a proletarian revolution and the establishment of a classless society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's emphasis on seizing power and controlling resources aligns with the core principles of capitalism, where individuals strive to maximize their own wealth and control over the economy. However, his focus on class struggle, revolutionary change, and transferring land to peasants reflects Marxist ideology, which advocates for a proletarian revolution leading to a classless society.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the Sharpeville massacre, which was a significant event in South Africa's history that highlighted racial oppression and discrimination. However, it does not symbolize the end of institutionalized discrimination. Nelson Mandela's election as President marked the official end to apartheid and the beginning of democratic governance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Boer War, with its focus on racial tensions and power struggles, ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a more equitable society in South Africa. Nelson Mandela's election was significant but occurred after the end of institutionalized discrimination.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Malians keep to prayers and study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) while learning the Quran by heart. These practices are indicative of a serious commitment to their Muslim faith.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the Malians' openness to friendships between men and women outside of family, demonstrating their commitment to inclusivity and tolerance, which are central tenets of Islam. Additionally, it mentions that they keep up with prayers, study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learn the Qur'an by heart. These practices show a serious approach towards their faith.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker mentions the need to smother both internal and external enemies of the Republic, emphasizing that terror is a consequence of democracy applied to urgent needs. This suggests concern for threats from within (internal) as well as outside forces (external). Among the options provided, counterrevolutionary opponents are most likely to be considered 'enemies' in this context.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against the enemies of the Republic suggests a fear of communist agitators who aimed to overthrow the existing social order and establish a classless society. However, his mention of both internal and external threats indicates that he is concerned with counterrevolutionary opponents within France as well as foreign invaders attempting to undermine or attack the revolution.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that Peter the Great was determined to change Russia and provide both direction and motive force for its transformation, even if it meant using education, persuasion, or force. This indicates a focus on reform rather than decentralization of power, isolationism, or maintaining serfdom.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to modernize Russia and his willingness to use force suggest a belief in decentralizing power and empowering the people to participate in the decision-making process. However, the passage also mentions that he was convinced of the need for him to provide direction and motive force, indicating that he did not fully embrace democratic reforms or decentralization. Instead, his approach aligns more with maintaining a strong central authority while implementing changes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Confucian teachings emphasize respect for elders, proper rituals, and maintaining harmony in society through hierarchical relationships. The passage from 'The Analects' highlights the importance of serving parents according to proper ritual during their lifetime and after death. This focus on hierarchy and filial piety was used politically to reinforce social order and stability.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Confucius' teachings on filial piety, with their emphasis on respect for parents and elders, aimed to promote gender equality by ensuring that both sons and daughters had equal responsibilities and rights within the family structure. This focus on familial relationships was a cornerstone of Confucian philosophy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh conditions, exploitation, and mistreatment of indigenous people in silver mines during the colonial period. It mentions that Indians were made to work without pay, forced into labor under pretexts, and lived in poverty due to debts imposed on them. These circumstances indicate a significant decline in their population as they faced harsh working conditions, exploitation, and mistreatment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment of indigenous populations and the disruption of their traditional ways of life, clearly demonstrating the dramatic alteration of New World religious traditions and social customs due to European influence. Therefore, option C is most directly supported.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speech given by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E., as recorded by Robert the Monk, is a call to arms for Christians to aid Jerusalem and other holy places that were under Muslim control during this time period. This event marked the beginning of the First Crusade, which was part of a series of religious wars known as The Crusades between Christians and Muslims over control of the Holy Land.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe. However, this speech specifically mentions aiding Christians in recovering territory lost to invaders who have desecrated holy sites, which is more closely associated with the Crusades - military campaigns sanctioned by the Catholic Church during the medieval period aimed at reclaiming Jerusalem and other Holy Land territories from Muslim control. The speech's emphasis on avenging wrongs against Christians and recovering lost territory for the holy church further supports this context.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Sadler Committee was established in the 19th century to investigate and report on the working conditions of children employed in factories during the Industrial Revolution. Labor unions, which are organizations formed by workers to protect their rights and interests, played a significant role in advocating for better wages, hours, and working conditions during this era.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Joint-stock companies, with their focus on collective ownership and shared profits, played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and improving working conditions during the Industrial Revolution. They were instrumental in pushing for reforms such as shorter work hours, better wages, and safer environments.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the need for unity, common purpose, and collaboration among African states to overcome the consequences of colonial rule. It does not mention ethnicity, language, religion, communism, or natural resources as factors preventing political dreams from being fulfilled. However, armed intervention on the part of Cold War superpowers could have disrupted efforts towards unity and progress in Africa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Africa's struggle to achieve unity and progress can be attributed to its shortage of natural resources, which limited its economic potential and hindered its ability to compete on the global stage. This scarcity made it difficult for African states to develop their financial structures, banking institutions, and harness material resources and human energies for national aspirations.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong discusses the issues arising from the growing disparity among peasants due to the forces of capitalism in rural areas, and proposes a solution through socialist transformation of agriculture alongside industrialization and commerce. This approach aligns with promoting collectivization of land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's concerns about the growing wealth gap and the potential for social unrest indicate a move towards liberal political and economic reforms, aimed at empowering individuals and fostering economic development. The focus on collectivization of land to reduce inequality between sectors of the population aligns with these goals.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers, including being conscripted at a young age, not returning home after service, and the burden of taxation on already struggling farmers. These issues indicate that there was significant discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive policies such as high taxes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of constant warfare and the hardships faced by soldiers suggest that foreign invasions and the need to defend the empire's borders were major contributing factors to the decline of the Tang dynasty. Additionally, the mention of 'the Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions' implies a focus on military expansion.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speech discusses the need for socialist transformation in agriculture, cooperation among peasants, and eliminating individual economies to improve living conditions collectively. This approach aligns with the principles of the green revolution, which aimed at increasing food production through modern techniques and improved crop varieties.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation of the peasant economy and the focus on collective farming methods directly contributed to the Green Revolution, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity and improve food security through technological advancements and modern farming techniques. This process is most closely related to option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a slave trade caravan operating in Algeria during the 1830s, which is part of North Africa and not directly connected to the Middle East or South America. Additionally, sugar plantations were more prevalent in Brazil than cotton plantations at that time. Considering these factors, it's unlikely that slaves from this caravan would be destined for either Elites' homes/harems in the Middle East (A) or sugar plantations in Brazil (B). The Mughal Empire was located in South Asia and not connected to North Africa slave trade routes. Therefore, the most likely destination is cotton plantations in North America (C), where there was a high demand for labor during that period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high value placed on young women and the brutal treatment of the slaves, it is likely that they were destined for cotton plantations in North America, where slave labor was extensively used in the cotton production process. The other options do not align as closely with the context provided.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text states that 'if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity', which implies that only those with a certain status or reputation could participate in the democratic process. It also mentions 'nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state'. This suggests that it was not about geographic boundaries but rather citizenship and ability to contribute to the state. Therefore, the answer should be limited to adult men who were citizens of the state by birth.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the inclusive nature of Athenian democracy, where all adult men and women who were citizens by birth had the right to participate in the political process and contribute to the governance of the state. This is evident from phrases like 'administration favors the many instead of the few' and 'if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker in the second passage expresses disappointment that despite gaining freedom, there has been no significant change in their socio-economic status or access to education for her children. This suggests that while political independence was achieved, social reforms and improvements in living conditions were not prioritized. Therefore, the most likely factor preventing progress is 'D': Prioritization of national liberation over social reform.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's disappointment likely stems from the new elites' resistance to women's rights and their reluctance to implement social reforms that would empower women and improve their status in society. This aligns with option C, which suggests hostility towards women's rights on the part of new elites.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage specifically mentions that an armed attack against one or more parties will be considered as an attack against all, and each party agrees to assist the attacked party through individual or collective self-defense measures, including the use of armed force if necessary. This concept is known as collective defense.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, with its emphasis on collective action and mutual aid against threats, aligns with the principles of communism, where nations work together to achieve common goals and defend against external aggression. However, it does not specifically promote capitalist or socialist economic systems. Additionally, while the treaty mentions self-defense in response to an armed attack (which could be interpreted as mutually assured destruction), its primary focus is on collective defense through cooperation among member nations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the advancements in foreign states, including steamships and efficient armies, which posed a threat to Japan's antiquated systems during that time. This led to significant changes in Japanese history as they modernized their society and government structure. The Meiji Restoration is known for these reforms and modernization efforts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concerns about foreign advancements and the need for modernization suggest that the era following the passage is the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period marked by Japan's isolationist policies and resistance to external influences. However, the Meiji Restoration was characterized by rapid modernization and westernization in response to foreign pressures, which aligns with the context of the letter.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Adolf Hitler, in his speech to the Reichstag, criticizes the Treaty of Versailles as a forced agreement that was not lawful for Germany due to its coercive nature and unfair terms imposed after World War I. This indicates that there was widespread dissatisfaction with how Germany had been treated at the end of the war.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hitler's strong opposition to the Treaty of Versailles was rooted in his belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated and that Germany had a right to reclaim lands lost after World War I. However, this specific quote from his speech does not directly address Polish borders or collaboration with Mussolini. Instead, it focuses on the perceived unfairness of the Treaty imposed upon Germany.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that China was mainly threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were ineffective due to their unwieldiness. Therefore, the Chinese focused on improving horse archer units which could effectively combat this threat. This indicates they chose a weapon better suited for their immediate military needs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese failure to innovate in gunpowder weaponry can be attributed to their overconfidence in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces, leading them to believe that further technological advancements were unnecessary. This is supported by the passage stating that China was mainly threatened by highly mobile steppe nomads and thus focused on improving horse archer units instead.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the disparity in benefits received from a revolution, with Olympe de Gouges emphasizing women's rights and Halima Ghomri discussing lack of change for peasants post-independence. This suggests that new liberties gained through revolution may not be evenly distributed or benefit all groups equally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri experienced disappointment and lack of improvement in their lives after their respective revolutions, which suggests revolutions generally fail to benefit women and minorities. The first passage highlights the continued oppression faced by women despite the French Revolution, while the second passage shows that even though Algeria gained independence from France, Halima Ghomri's life remained unchanged.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both sources discuss medical knowledge, with Source 1 being a description of treating thigh fractures from the late seventh century C.E., attributed to Paul of Aegina, and Source 2 discussing the importance of understanding causes in medicine, written by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) around 1020 C.E. The time period between these two sources indicates a cultural exchange through Byzantine and Islamic scholars who preserved Greek medical knowledge during this era.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Aegina and the Mediterranean, which are close to Mesoamerica, indicating a possible influence of Mesoamerican science on European medical practices. Additionally, it discusses trade routes between Europe and Asia during this period.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Tsar Nicholas II mentions internal troubles, a foreign enemy trying to enslave their country for three years, and the need for unity in order to achieve victory. The context suggests that Russia was facing significant challenges during World War I, including military losses and social unrest among the working classes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nicholas II mentions the 'happiness of the people,' suggesting that economic prosperity and dissatisfaction with the aristocracy led to his abdication. However, he also refers to internal troubles threatening Russia during a war against a foreign enemy, indicating military losses and resentment from the working classes as significant factors.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 is from the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, which clearly states that 'The Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire.' This implies a preference for religious uniformity within the state during this period. The other options do not align with the information provided in the source.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Brazilian constitution mentions a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion as the religion of the Empire, suggesting a connection between religious authority and the divine right of monarchs. It also allows followers of other religions to worship within their households or specific houses for that purpose, indicating some level of toleration but not uniformity.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poet emphasizes the long history of poets, knowledge about stars and Atlantis in 'our America', suggesting that this region has been culturally rich and vibrant for a very long time. This is not specifically about excellence in poetry or scientific contributions, nor does it mention any prophecy regarding events.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of consulting the stars and having poets since ancient times suggests that Latin America has a history of scientific inquiry and astronomical knowledge. This, combined with references to Netzahualcoyotl, Atlantis, Montezuma, Inca, and Christopher Columbus, highlights the region's rich cultural heritage.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'his Indians' in the context of a Spanish nobleman requiring labor to cultivate and provide produce suggests an economic practice where indigenous people were forced into service for colonial powers. Among the options, the encomienda system was specifically implemented during the colonization period, granting Spanish settlers control over native populations for labor purposes in exchange for their conversion to Christianity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The nobleman likely had indigenous people working for him as apprentices, learning agricultural techniques in exchange for food and shelter. This practice was common during the colonization period.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage emphasizes that most authorities believed in the obligation of jihad until all the world was under Islam, and a ruler failing to prosecute it would be better dead than alive. This suggests that the ideology of holy war (jihad) was taken seriously during this era.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the duty of jihad and the goal of bringing the world under Islamic sway, indicating that many Muslims during the Crusades were inherently violent and driven by their faith to conquer others. This supports the assumption that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mahatma Gandhi was a prominent leader who advocated for non-violent resistance and civil disobedience as means to achieve political and social change, particularly in India during its struggle for independence from British rule. His message of remaining non-violent aligns with the principles that inspired various movements around the world. Among the given options, the civil rights movement in the United States, which sought to end racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans through peaceful protests and legal challenges, most closely reflects Gandhi's influence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance likely inspired the Zionist movement, as they both employed civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve their goals. However, the context of Gandhi's message is more closely related to India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule and his influence on other anti-colonial movements in Southeast Asia.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Egyptian New Kingdom, which existed between 1550 and 1069 B.C.E., was known for its military campaigns to expand and secure territories in the Near East. This included conflicts with various powers such as the Hittites over control of strategic regions like Syria and the Levant.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions a champion of Syria, which suggests a conflict with the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. However, this time period does not align with the New Kingdom era (1550-1069 BCE). Instead, during the Egyptian New Kingdom, there were significant conflicts over Syria and the Levant region, particularly against the Hittites.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided comes from 'Journey to the West', which was written around 1590s, long after Xuanzang lived (602-664 AD). This work is a fictionalized account of his travels and adventures, including interactions with mythical characters like the Monkey King. Therefore, it complicates historians' understanding by presenting an embellished version of events.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt was written centuries after Xuanzang lived, making it unreliable and irrelevant to understanding his actual career. It also includes fictional elements like the Monkey King, which further complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is from the Upanishads, which are ancient Indian texts that predate Ashoka's reign (3rd century BCE). Sikhism arose in the 15th century CE and was not influenced by Ashoka. Islam arrived after Ashoka's time through invasions. Hinduism continued to exist alongside Buddhism during and after Ashoka's rule, but there is no evidence of it being eradicated by force. However, historical records show that Emperor Ashoka embraced Buddhism and promoted its teachings throughout his empire.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the self and controlling the mind, which aligns with Ashoka's efforts to eradicate traditional Hinduism and promote Buddhism. Among the given options, only one reflects this change: the official encouragement of Buddhist edicts.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the trading of copper and gold, with Musa mentioning that they sell copper in exchange for gold from Sudan. This indicates a form of international trade involving these mineral resources between Mali and other regions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the extraction of gold from pits, indicating that Mali possessed advanced mining technologies that contributed to its wealth. It also mentions trading copper with Sudan for gold, suggesting international trade involving these resources.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem expresses a strong sense of national pride and resistance against foreign intervention, particularly from the United States. It references historical figures and events related to Spanish America, emphasizing its cultural heritage and identity. Given this context, it is most likely that the poet was responding to U.S. involvement in Panama's independence, which threatened the sovereignty of Latin American countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's themes of resistance against a powerful invader and the mention of 'barbarous soul' suggest it was written in response to the Haitian Revolution and the fight against French colonialism. This aligns with Ruben Dario's known political views, making option D the most likely answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the letter describes damage caused by a contingent of natives, which led him to sue the Government for damages done. This indicates that the British government was held responsible for protecting its citizens in South Africa and compensating them when harm occurred due to conflicts with local populations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The British government used incidents like the one described to justify taxing the Zulu kingdom and demanding reparations for damages caused by their actions. This is evident in historical events such as the Anglo-Zulu War, where Britain sought compensation from the Zulu Kingdom.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the construction of Uruk, mentioning its rampart and walls, as well as the Eanna temple dedicated to Ishtar. This indicates that ancient cities like Uruk had designated areas for worshiping their patron deities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage focuses on the impressive walls and ramparts of Uruk, suggesting that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications and were vulnerable to attacks. However, it also mentions the Eanna temple dedicated to Ishtar, indicating that religious worship was an important aspect of these cities.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to the 'Winter King', a term associated with Frederick V, Elector Palatine of the Rhine, who was a Protestant leader during the Thirty Years' War and briefly accepted the Bohemian crown before losing it to Ferdinand II, an ally of the Catholic Habsburgs. The song encourages him to seek pardon from 'Ferdinand', his king, indicating that he is not in favor with the current ruler.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song criticizes the 'Winter King' for snatching the crown and emphasizes the legitimacy of Ferdinand as the rightful king, suggesting a conflict between Muslims and Christians during this period. Given that the Winter King refers to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was Protestant but lost his title in the Thirty Years' War against Catholic forces led by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor (Ferdinand), it is likely that the narrator identifies as a supporter of Ferdinand and thus would be from the opposing religious group. The correct answer is A: Roman Catholic.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494 between Spain (Castile, Leon, Aragon) and Portugal, established a boundary for their respective territories discovered during voyages of exploration. This treaty shows that monarchs were actively involved in sponsoring these expeditions to discover new lands and establish boundaries for colonization.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty focuses on dividing newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal, which suggests it was related to the trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there is no direct mention or implication of such a trade in this excerpt. Instead, the text discusses how these monarchs are actively involved in determining boundaries for their respective territories discovered during voyages of exploration. This involvement indicates that they were interested and invested in these expeditions.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a violent revolt against British rule in India, where the colonized people retaliated against their oppressors and targeted not only military personnel but also civilians (women and children). This context aligns with 'killing of civilians during wartime', as it involves violence perpetrated by both sides within a conflict setting.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe violence and massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, suggesting that banditry due to socio-economic breakdown was a significant issue in colonial India. However, the focus is on the deliberate targeting of civilians (white men, women, and children) by rebels as part of their struggle against British rule. This aligns with violence occurring during wartime when non-combatants are killed intentionally.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Mansa Musa's statement about collecting duties only on crude copper, which is then sold for gold to pagan nations. This indicates that Mali's wealth was significantly derived from the mineral resources (copper and gold) in their kingdom.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Mansa Musa's control over 'pagan nations' and the slave trade, suggesting that Mali's wealth primarily came from the exploitation of the slave trade. Additionally, it highlights the extraction of gold as a significant source of income for the kingdom.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that soldiers were summoned 'to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes', which indicates a religious motivation behind their actions, as they are targeting people based on their perceived lack of adherence to Islamic beliefs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the capture of a large number of women, indicating that the Arab slave trade was primarily driven by the demand for female slaves for domestic and reproductive purposes. However, to determine if religion played a role in this trade, we need to look at statements directly related to religious motivations or justifications.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The documents provided are from Simon Bolivar, a key figure in Latin American independence movements who convened the Congress of Angostura and helped establish Gran Colombia. Similarly, the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil was established during a period when many Latin American nations were gaining independence from colonial powers. These events suggest that revolts organized by provincial elites in Latin American nations are most directly responsible for creating these constitutions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The documents likely arose from colonial powers guiding their colonies towards self-governance, as they outline frameworks for independent republics. Source 1 describes the unification of Venezuela and New Granada into a single Republic under the title 'Republic of Colombia', while Source 2 establishes an Empire with its own territory, government, dynasty, and religion. Both documents reflect efforts to create constitutional structures in newly independent states.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses non-alignment and cooperation with all states, regardless of their economic system (capitalist, socialist, or mixed economy). This approach is not related to the ideologies of World War II or I, nor does it pertain to colonization companies in Africa. Instead, it refers to a policy during the Cold War era when countries had to navigate between capitalist and socialist blocs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation mentioned likely refers to the alliances formed during World War I, where countries with different ideologies collaborated against common enemies. This is because Nkrumah mentions non-alignment and cooperation among states regardless of their economic systems (capitalist, socialist, or mixed economy), which aligns more closely with the complexities of alliances formed during World War I.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Between 1450 and 1750 C.E., Western European global hegemony was influenced by factors such as the exchange of food sources, gunpowder technologies, and joint-stock companies. However, steam-powered technologies were not developed until the late 18th century, making them irrelevant to this time period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gunpowder technology was primarily a medieval advancement, so it wouldn't have significantly contributed to European hegemony between 1450 and 1750. The exchange of food sources (Columbian Exchange) greatly impacted Europe's population growth and economy during this period. Joint-stock companies facilitated the expansion of trade and colonization, while steam power was not developed until later in the Industrial Revolution, which began around 1760.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Rome expanded through conquest, leading to a diverse population with different cultures and values. This diversity eventually contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire as it became difficult to maintain unity and control over such a vast territory. Among the given options, cultural assimilation is mentioned in the context of limiting diversity within an empire.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Classical empires often supported foreign religions to appease conquered populations and ensure stability within the empire. This approach helped maintain peace, foster loyalty, and prevent rebellion among diverse groups under their rule.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt mentions that the king and majority of his ministers are Muslim, but it also states that the people's religion is paganism and worship of idols. This suggests a coexistence of Islam among elites while lower classes maintained their traditional beliefs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muslim merchants likely adhered to strict religious principles, refusing to engage in trade with individuals outside their faith. However, the text does not provide evidence of this behavior specifically during this time period or within Africa as a whole. The excerpt mentions that some elites converted to Islam and maintained certain customs (e.g., wearing sewn clothes), while lower classes continued practicing paganism. There is no mention of imams enforcing Islamic law across all Africans, nor does it state that African kings required Muslims to conform to pagan practices at court.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to the 'Winter King', which is a nickname for Frederick V, Elector Palatine, who was briefly king of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War. This war involved many European powers and had significant religious undertones, with Ferdinand II being recognized as the lawful king by the Peace of Prague in 1620. The song reflects on Frederick V's loss of power and his need to seek pardon from Ferdinand.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The song likely refers to the War of Spanish Succession, a conflict over who would inherit the Spanish throne, impacting various European powers. This war involved several monarchies and territories, including Bohemia (part of modern-day Czech Republic), which aligns with the mention of 'Bohemia's lawful king.' The other options do not directly relate to this context.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Quran verse warns against strong drink and games of chance, which are considered sinful activities according to Islamic teachings. This indicates a religious regulation on personal behavior within the Islamic society. On the other hand, Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat mentions pouring wine when roses bloom, reflecting cultural practices but not directly addressing economic processes or gender relations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both verses address the production and consumption of food and drink within Islamic societies, highlighting regulations and cultural practices. The Quran verse discourages strong drink (alcohol) while Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat mentions pouring wine during a specific time.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks in Hangzhou, with their own districts, mosques, cells, colleges, and a large number of followers. This indicates that different religious groups were allowed to practice their faith openly and had established communities within Yuan China.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of Muslim communities and their influence suggests that foreigners likely held significant administrative positions in Yuan China. Additionally, the mention of a city division specifically for Jews, Christians, and Turks indicates religious tolerance within the society.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Marco Polo was received and respected within the court of the grand Khan, indicating that the Mongols were open to different cultures and languages. This suggests they generally assimilated or ignored cultural identities rather than imposing their own beliefs or showing disinterest in trade.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' vast empire and efficient postal system suggest they often took over territory peacefully, establishing order and communication networks. Additionally, the passage mentions that Marco Polo was welcomed and respected in the court of the grand Khan, indicating a level of cultural assimilation rather than imposition or destruction.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the decline of Rome due to overexpansion, corruption within its military forces, and eventual invasion by barbarians. Among the options provided, Han (China) and Gupta (India) empires also experienced similar patterns: they expanded significantly before eventually facing internal decay and external invasions that led to their downfall.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The factors leading to the Roman Empire's decline, such as overexpansion and internal strife, are also applicable to other classical empires like the Qin and Etruscan. Both experienced rapid expansion followed by political instability and eventual collapse.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's writings discuss the struggle against neo-colonialism, emphasizing non-alignment and cooperation with all states while maintaining control over foreign investments to protect national interests. This context aligns closely with the period of decolonization when newly independent nations sought to establish their sovereignty and economic independence from former colonial powers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writing likely emerged during the Industrial Revolution, as he criticizes the exploitation of less developed nations by industrialized powers. However, his focus on neo-colonialism and non-alignment suggests a post-World War II context when many countries were gaining independence from colonial rule. The best fit for this historical period is decolonization.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the impact of the Mongol Empire on international contact, trade routes, and cultural exchange between civilizations in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. It mentions that all religions were tolerated within their domains, which facilitated peaceful coexistence among once-hostile peoples.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. This is because a well-policed domain would require organized medical care for its inhabitants, especially considering the vastness of their territory.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes the promotion of Ahura Mazda and Zoroastrianism under Sassanid rule, but it does not mention any specific efforts to convert people away from Buddhism or grant limited toleration to Buddhists. Additionally, there is no reference to Buddhism's apocalyptic message swaying converts in Persia. However, the presence of diverse religious communities like Jews, Christians, and Manichaeans suggests that Sassanid Persia was a cosmopolitan society with international connections. Given its location along trade routes between East and West, it is likely that Buddhist communities were present due to these interactions.",C,Let's reason step by step. Persia's location on major trade routes between India and the West likely facilitated the spread of Buddhism and the establishment of Buddhist communities within the empire. The other options do not directly explain the presence of these communities.,C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The verse celebrates New York City, incorporating elements of jazz music and African American culture into its imagery. This reflects a blending of Western forms with non-Western cultural influences, particularly those from Africa and the African diaspora.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem likely served as a form of political propaganda, advocating for racial equality and social justice within a specific context. It uses vivid imagery and metaphor to convey its message, which aligns with the characteristics of politically motivated art and literature.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong emphasizes the importance of socialist transformation, cooperation, and eliminating individual economies in rural areas to improve living conditions for all peasants. The development that would most undermine these hopes is one that directly contradicts this approach. Option C describes a situation where cooperatives and countryside steel production led to famine and poverty among the Chinese peasantry, which goes against Mao's vision of improving rural living conditions through socialist transformation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. The development of Special Economic Zones and political friction with the Soviet Union do not directly undermine Mao's hopes regarding agriculture. However, cooperatives on farmland combined with countryside steel production led to famine and poverty among peasants, which would significantly weaken the worker-peasant alliance that Mao aimed to consolidate.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty emphasizes peaceful resolution of disputes, development of friendly international relations, and collective defense against armed attacks in the North Atlantic area. It specifically mentions Article 51 of the UN Charter, which recognizes the right to self-defense. This indicates that it is a response to potential aggression from outside Western Europe.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty likely aimed to maintain the balance of power in Europe by creating a system of alliances and deterring potential aggressors. It emphasizes peaceful resolution, collective defense, and mutual aid among member states. This aligns with the concept of balancing power dynamics rather than focusing on trade or reconstruction efforts.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States) both aimed to restrict immigration based on certain criteria, such as language proficiency or labor agreements. These acts were part of broader policies that sought to maintain a predominantly white population in Australia by limiting non-European immigration. The White Australia Policy was an official government policy that embodied these principles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act aimed to diversify the Australian economy by attracting skilled laborers from various European countries and limiting unskilled labor. This policy was part of a broader initiative known as the White Australia Policy, which sought to restrict non-European immigration.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck's speech highlighted the plight of workers and their lack of security, which led to social reforms aimed at providing support for them. This eventually resulted in the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's social welfare programs likely led to a decrease in German economic output due to increased taxes and regulations on businesses. However, the most significant long-term effect of his speech was the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe as other countries adopted similar policies.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The time frame mentioned in the information is the 1940s, which aligns with World War II (C). During this period, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and entered Korea to fulfill their agreement at the Yalta Conference.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a consequence of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict with implications for territorial control in Asia. However, this event occurred before World War II and is not directly related to the situation described in the passage. Both World Wars I and II involved significant changes in world power dynamics but did not specifically lead to Soviet involvement in Korea during the time frame mentioned. The Crimean War was a conflict between Russia and an alliance of Western powers, which does not align with the context provided.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria in 1839 was a plea against the opium trade, which had detrimental effects on China and its people. The delivery of this letter did not result in immediate changes or successful ban of the opium trade; instead, it led to increased tensions between China and Western powers. This eventually culminated in the First Opium War (1839-1842), where Chinese forces were defeated by British naval power.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter likely aimed to expel all foreigners from Chinese territory due to their involvement in the opium trade and its harmful effects on Chinese society. However, this did not happen immediately after his letter was delivered.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage discusses how native Siberians were forced to pay yasak tribute, initially in fur or cash. It mentions the depletion of fur-bearing animals and loss of horses as factors that made it difficult for natives to fulfill their obligations. Among the options provided, epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers would have directly affected the native population's ability to hunt or gather resources, exacerbating their difficulties in meeting tribute requirements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the scarcity of fur-bearing animals, which suggests a change in the environment like global warming that makes it harder for the natives to hunt and pay tribute. However, this factor is already mentioned indirectly through the decline in animal populations. Epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers could have significantly reduced the native population's ability to fulfill their obligations due to illness or death. The arrival of rival hunters from China and Japan would not directly affect the natives' ability to pay tribute, as it doesn't impact the availability of animals for them specifically. Lastly, a reduced demand for furs among elites could decrease the value of their tributes but wouldn't necessarily make fulfilling obligations more difficult.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the presence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians living within walled districts in Hangzhou during Ibn Battuta's visit. This suggests that there was a level of tolerance for foreign merchants and religious groups to reside and trade within Chinese cities. However, it does not mention any specific policy changes under the Ming Dynasty regarding trade with foreigners or endorsement of Chinese merchants abroad.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes wealthy merchants with significant influence, suggesting that Confucian principles were relaxed to allow merchants a greater role in government. This aligns with the Ming Dynasty's policies of promoting trade and commerce.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the harmful effects of opium and how it is strictly prohibited in Britain due to its destructive impact on mankind. Lin Zexu argues that since Britain does not allow opium to injure their own country, they should not transfer this drug to China or any other nation. This complaint directly addresses the issue of British sale of opium in China.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the British for introducing a harmful drug to China, and since heroin is a well-known dangerous drug, it's likely the source of the complaint. Additionally, opium was historically known as a major issue between Britain and China during this time period.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that Chinese Emperor was not interested in European goods and had no use for their manufactures, implying a high demand for Chinese products from Europeans. This would have led to an influx of silver into China as the primary medium of exchange for these goods. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the influx of silver into China due to European demand for goods, and Portugal's early trade presence likely led to their increased power and prestige. However, this does not directly address the impact on worldwide silver supply or British actions in relation to Japan or Malacca Strait.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2, the Statement of Purpose from National Organization for Women (NOW), clearly states that they believe it is time to move beyond abstract discussions and take concrete action towards achieving equality for women in America. This implies that at this point in time, their goals had not been fully achieved.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the need to move beyond discussions and symposia, indicating a shift towards more abstract and theoretical explorations of women's issues. It also highlights the goal of achieving full equality for all women in America, suggesting that this had not yet been accomplished.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a military leader who is successful in warfare, capturing territories and defeating rivals. This suggests that early urban societies placed importance on military prowess and had organized armies to expand their influence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the speaker's travels and conquests, suggesting the development of extensive trade routes connecting different regions. This is supported by the mention of overcoming various lands, capturing cattle (indicating movement of goods), and interacting with a Syrian champion in their tent.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how slaves captured in the Arab slave trade had different prices based on their age, gender, and beauty, suggesting that they could potentially gain freedom or improve their status over time. In contrast, there is no mention of such opportunities for those involved in the Atlantic slave trade.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage refers to the capture of ""idolatrous Koholanes"", implying that the Arab slave trade was driven by religious motivations, unlike the primarily economic Atlantic slave trade. Additionally, it mentions that slaves taken for the Atlantic trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, while those taken by Arab merchants did have a chance at freedom.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe situations where indigenous populations are forced to provide labor or pay tribute, which is a form of coerced labor. The first passage talks about the mita system in Peru, while the second discusses yasak tribute in Siberia. These systems were used by colonial powers to exploit local resources and manpower.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe systems of forced labor imposed by colonial powers, which aligns with the historical role of joint-stock companies in colonizing overseas territories. The first passage discusses mita, a system used by Spanish colonizers to extract labor from indigenous populations for mining operations. The second passage describes yasak tribute and coerced hunting among native Siberians under Russian control.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 describes how Kongolese people, including noblemen and relatives of the King, were being seized and sold to white men in their kingdoms. This indicates that there was a significant issue with slavery during this time period. Source 2 shows that Portugal wanted to fill ships with goods from Kongo, but it also mentions serving God and the king's pleasure, which could imply some level of diplomatic relations. However, the main focus is on acquiring slaves or other valuable commodities for trade.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letters highlight concerns about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, suggesting the presence of regulations to control and limit trade interactions between Portugal and Kongo. King Afonso I expresses his dissatisfaction with the seizure of their people for sale as slaves, while King Manuel instructs his envoy on how to ensure profitable returns from the expedition.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes exploitative practices towards indigenous people in Spanish colonies, including forced labor, debt bondage, and sexual abuse. Compared to these practices, the English treatment of natives was different primarily due to their policy against intermingling with the native population. This is reflected in laws like the Virginia Assembly's 1691 act prohibiting marriage between English women and Native Americans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the mistreatment of indigenous people in Spanish colonies, which contrasts with the English experience where conflicts often arose from differing concepts of land ownership. While all options may have some truth to them, option B directly addresses a specific issue mentioned in the text that distinguished English treatment: confusion over native notions of land ownership.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno, an Indonesian leader, was speaking at the Bandung Conference in 1955, a time when many Asian and African countries were gaining independence from colonial rule. The term 'revolutions' here refers to these struggles for self-determination and sovereignty against foreign powers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is decolonization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's reference to ""revolutions"" likely alludes to the communist movements gaining traction in Asia and Africa during the Cold War era. These revolutions were often associated with anti-colonial struggles, as many countries sought independence from European powers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Communism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II delivered this speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095, calling for a crusade to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy sites from Muslim control. The most direct result of his call was the initiation of the First Crusade, which aimed to recapture the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean region) from Muslim rule. This led to the conquest of several key cities in the area by Latin Christians.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech urges Christians to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, suggesting that this call led to the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks and the restoration of Christian dominance in the Levant. This event is known as the First Crusade.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that many officials, including those in charge of the treasury, are Muslims and that there is a significant presence of Islamic practices within the kingdom. This suggests that Islam has been integrated into Ghanaian society to some extent. However, it does not indicate that the king himself converted or that African kings were vassals of caliphs. The most likely explanation for having Muslim officials in charge of the treasury is to facilitate trade with predominantly Muslim merchants during this era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a Muslim overseeing the treasury, which suggests that the king of Ghana had recently converted to Islam and was incorporating Muslim advisors into his administration. This would explain why a Muslim is in charge of the Ghanian treasury.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a society where women do not wear the veil despite their perseverance in prayers, and they have friends and companions amongst men outside prohibited degrees of marriage. This suggests that the practice is rooted in cultural norms rather than religious or climatic reasons. Therefore, it's likely due to preexisting cultural patterns.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes women as not being modest and not veiling themselves, indicating that they were viewed primarily as sexual objects and had limited control over their own bodies. This aligns with the idea of them being prevented from veiling due to societal norms rather than a rebellion or climate-related reasons.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Source 3, written by the Gay Liberation Front, explicitly states that their long-term goal is to rid society of the gender-role system which they believe is at the root of their oppression. They mention eliminating social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles as a necessary step towards achieving this goal.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the need to eliminate gender roles, suggesting that societal privileging of certain races over others is a key obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation. This aligns with Source 3's emphasis on eliminating social pressures for men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph were primarily based on manual labor, traditional manufacturing methods, and limited transportation capabilities. During the period 1750-1900 C.E., the Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in production processes, leading to mass production of goods, improved transportation systems, and increased global trade. This shift would have had a direct impact on altering traditional trade patterns by enabling more efficient and widespread exchange of goods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade system where silver flowed from Japan to China, and this pattern was likely disrupted by Enlightenment revolutions that transformed European societies and economies. However, the most direct undoing of these patterns would be the Industrial Revolution (C), which led to increased production capabilities in Europe and reduced reliance on imported goods like silk and porcelain from China.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the inhabitants as 'pious, humble, upright, and generous in character', treating strangers well and giving liberally to devotees. This suggests that religious piety was highly valued and influential within their society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the challenges faced by Aden's inhabitants, including water scarcity and dependence on Arab control, suggesting a hostile environment for outsiders and merchants. However, it also highlights the piety, generosity, and good treatment of strangers among the local population, indicating that despite external pressures, religious values were upheld.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The account describes a society where people practice Islam, including prayers and studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). Mali is located in West Africa, far from the regions of Berber mystics or Ethiopian pilgrims. Additionally, there were no significant Mughal armies that conquered this region during Ibn Battuta's time. The most likely source of Islam in Mali would be through contact with Muslim trade caravans traveling across Africa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the practice of Islam in Mali, which likely originated from pilgrims traveling to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia and spreading the religion throughout the region. This is supported by historical accounts that indicate trade routes between West Africa and North Africa facilitated cultural exchange and religious diffusion.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's reception at the court of the grand Khan, where he is welcomed warmly, honored above courtiers, and learns Tartar manners and languages. This indicates a friendly cultural exchange between Europe (represented by Marco Polo) and Asia (the land of the grand Khan).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's positive reception by the Khan, which contradicts the prevailing notion of widespread conflict and lack of cooperation among major political groups during the High Middle Ages. Instead, it highlights a friendly cultural exchange between Europe (Marco Polo) and Asia (the grand Khan).",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes self-awareness, understanding, and mindfulness as key elements for spiritual evolution, rather than relying on external authorities or rituals. It suggests that individual responsibility is crucial in achieving enlightenment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and spiritual growth, suggesting that Hindus should abandon their faith and embrace Buddhism to achieve enlightenment. It highlights individual responsibility in achieving spiritual evolution rather than relying on priestly authority or adhering strictly to caste systems.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions damage caused by natives, which indicates conflict between British citizens and local inhabitants in South Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War. This war was fought between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom, a nation of South African decedents of the Dutch (Boers). Therefore, the direct effect mentioned is related to this conflict.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference was a significant event in late nineteenth-century European history, where major powers like Great Britain faced consequences for their actions, including territorial losses. However, the letter from the British citizen during the Anglo-Zulu War does not mention any penalties or loss of land due to the conference. Instead, it highlights conflicts with local populations in South Africa.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses using terror as a tool to achieve justice and protect the Republic, suggesting that the desired outcome (protecting the Republic) justifies the use of extreme measures (terror). This aligns with the political principle 'The end justifies the means', which states that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against enemies of the Republic suggests a belief in the inherent power and authority of the state to enforce its will, regardless of ethical considerations. This aligns with the principle that 'the end justifies the means', where achieving the desired outcome (preserving the Republic) is seen as more important than adhering strictly to moral or legal constraints.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Lin Zexu's concerns about opium being transferred from Europe to China, and how it is harmful to mankind. It also mentions that European countries export products beneficial to mankind. This implies a trade imbalance where Chinese goods are not as valuable or desirable in the eyes of Europeans compared to their own exports like tea. Therefore, the most likely reason for engaging in such actions would be related to economic interests and trade disparities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage hints at economic factors driving European actions. Considering the high demand for Chinese tea in Europe, it's likely that rising prices and trade imbalances led to tensions and the opium trade. Therefore, the most plausible answer is related to the price of Chinese tea.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's view on agricultural cooperation emphasizes collective ownership and socialist transformation of agriculture, which aligns with communism ideals that advocate for a classless society where the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole. Joseph Stalin was known for his implementation of these principles in the Soviet Union.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's call for agricultural cooperation reflects a trend towards globalized economic models, where collaboration and shared resources are key to achieving prosperity and stability. However, his emphasis on eliminating the rich-peasant economy and individualism aligns more closely with communist ideals that advocate collective ownership of means of production.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont emphasizes Jerusalem as a 'royal city,' its desecration, and the need for liberation from non-believers. He calls upon Christians to undertake this journey not only for remission of sins but also for the glory of heaven. This context aligns with pilgrimages to centers of religious significance where believers travel to sacred sites.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's focus on Jerusalem's importance suggests a connection to the flourishing of religious art during this period, as artists sought to depict and celebrate holy sites. However, the text emphasizes the city's significance due to its association with Jesus Christ and the Christian faith, rather than solely for its artistic value. The mention of pilgrimages in the context of Jerusalem aligns more closely with Pope Urban II's call for aid and liberation of the holy city from non-Christian control.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'second wall' mentioned in the passage refers to the argument that only the Pope can interpret Scriptures, which is a point of contention between Catholics and Reformers during the Reformation period. Martin Luther criticizes this viewpoint as it prevents others from understanding or interpreting the Bible for themselves.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ""second wall"" likely refers to disagreements between Catholics and Reformers regarding the divinity of Jesus, a central theological point of contention during the Reformation. However, in this passage, Martin Luther is specifically addressing issues related to authority over interpretation of Scripture and calling councils, which are not directly tied to beliefs about Jesus' divinity.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe the process and reasoning behind treating a fractured thigh, emphasizing understanding causes and symptoms to achieve effective treatment. This approach is based on observation, logical deduction, and practical application rather than supernatural or astrological beliefs. Therefore, both sources rely on reason and rationalistic understandings of physical phenomena.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages demonstrate a reliance on abstract philosophical principles to understand physical phenomena and guide medical practices, emphasizing theoretical knowledge over empirical observation. They discuss the importance of understanding causes and symptoms in medicine, which aligns with an abstract philosophical approach.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that the Chinese emperor was not interested in strange or costly objects, implying a limited interest in foreign trade. During this era (1750-1900), China restricted foreign trade primarily through the Canton System, which confined European merchants to specific cities designated for foreign trade.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During this era, European powers often established exclusive trade agreements with specific regions. Considering the Dutch presence in Asia, it's likely they held exclusive trading rights with China, limiting British involvement. This aligns with historical records of the Canton System.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther, in his letter to the Christian Nobility of Germany, discusses various issues related to the Church such as its worldly pomp, power dynamics (Temporal Power vs Spirituality), and the creation of cardinals for acquiring wealth and influence. However, he does not mention anything about the sale of indulgences.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's address to the nobility suggests a concern with the political nature of the church and its entanglement with secular authorities, a common issue during the Reformation. He also criticizes the wealth and power of the clergy, specifically mentioning cardinals and their acquisition of rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices. However, Luther does not explicitly address the sale of indulgences in this particular letter.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text emphasizes the importance of virtue, morals, proper laws, and justice as essential elements for a functioning legal system. It also mentions that happiness consists in practicing virtue and that the rule of law is more powerful than tyrants because it provides beneficent austerity. Based on these points, the author believes that morality and justice are requirements for a properly functioning legal system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bolivar's vision for a just legal system emphasizes the importance of truth and religious values as foundational principles for guiding individual and societal behavior. He argues that happiness comes from practicing virtue, which is rooted in morality and justice. Therefore, these two elements are essential requirements for a properly functioning legal system.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a situation where children are working in factories, receiving low wages and facing poor conditions due to necessity. This scenario is indicative of the labor practices during the Industrial Revolution when child labor was prevalent, and workers faced harsh conditions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The harsh working conditions and child labor described in the passage are likely a consequence of the Scientific Revolution, where new technologies and industrial processes led to changes in labor practices. However, these specific issues were more prevalent during the Industrial Revolution when factories became widespread and workers' rights were not yet established.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the king levies one golden dinar on every donkey-load of salt brought into the country and two dinars when it is sent out, as well as five mithqals from a load of copper and ten mithqals from other goods. This indicates that the economy involves taxation on imports and exports of these commodities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details various goods like salt and copper, suggesting a diverse agricultural base and a self-sufficient economy in Ghana, with minimal reliance on external trade. However, the most explicit information provided is about taxation: 'On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out.' This indicates that the king was directly involved in regulating and profiting from the trade of these goods. Therefore, the correct answer is that the king taxed salt and copper imports and exports.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to 'continual beatings' due to backwardness and weakness implies a need for strength, unity, and defense against external threats. Among the options provided, the Brezhnev Doctrine was aimed at maintaining control over Soviet satellite states in Europe and suppressing anti-Soviet protests, which aligns with the idea of preventing further 'beatings' due to perceived weakness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's historical analysis of Russia's vulnerability likely influenced the decision to declare war on Japan in 1945, aiming to prevent future threats and assert Soviet strength. This aligns with his emphasis on not lagging behind or being beaten due to backwardness.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese emperor states they possess all things and have no value for strange or ingenious objects, indicating a lack of interest in foreign goods. This suggests that their primary concern was not about the potential influence of Britain but rather the perceived insignificance of British products.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's response likely reflects underlying political tensions between China and Great Britain, possibly due to British involvement in Chinese foreign affairs or territorial disputes. This could have led the Chinese to be cautious about expanding trade relations with a potentially influential power like Great Britain.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed to resolve disputes over newly discovered lands during the Age of Exploration, when European maritime powers were exploring and claiming territories around the world. This treaty aimed to divide these newfound lands between Spain (Castile) and Portugal along a meridian line in the Atlantic Ocean. The context that best fits this historical event is the era of European maritime exploration.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas aligns with the historical context of the African slave trade, where European powers sought to divide territories and control resources, including human labor. However, this treaty specifically deals with dividing newly discovered lands between Spain (Castile, Leon, Aragon) and Portugal along a meridian line in the Atlantic Ocean. This division was crucial for both countries' maritime exploration efforts during the Age of Discovery.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, and mentions racial dominance, oppression, and apartheid explicitly. Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 until the early 1990s.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's description of racial oppression and segregation aligns with the Jim Crow laws prevalent in the United States during the same era, highlighting the global struggle against racial injustice. However, it specifically mentions South Africa, where apartheid was a systematic policy enforcing racial segregation and discrimination. The poem's focus on Sharpeville, an event that occurred in South Africa, directly points to apartheid as the correct answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses serving parents according to proper ritual while they are alive, burying them properly after death, and sacrificing to them as per the rituals. These actions reflect a deep respect for one's parents and adherence to traditional customs, which is the essence of filial piety.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation, suggesting that even in cases of disobedience, children should seek to restore harmony with their parents through proper rituals. This aligns closely with the concept of filial piety.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to the Winter King as having 'snatched the kaiser's crown', which implies that he took over a position or territory belonging to someone else, in this case, Ferdinand. This action is described as naughty and shameful, suggesting it was not approved of. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the Winter King rebelled against King Ferdinand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song suggests that the Winter King, recognizing his error in claiming the crown, voluntarily abdicated and returned it to the rightful ruler, King Ferdinand. This is evident from lines such as 'Right well you knew...That Ferdinand alone can be Bohemia's lawful king.' and 'So come, dear Fritz, rouse up and go To Ferdinand, your king,' which indicate that he acknowledges his mistake and seeks to make amends by returning the crown.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Walter Rodney discusses the impact of imperialism on African underdevelopment, focusing on economic exploitation and resource drainage caused by Western European capitalists extending their influence to cover all of Africa. This argument aligns with the colonization period when European powers established control over various regions in Africa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rodney's analysis likely addresses the impact of New World crops introduced to Africa during this period, leading to economic shifts and potential disruptions to existing agricultural systems. This development could have contributed to African underdevelopment as it altered traditional practices and economies.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Gilgamesh as being two-thirds god and one-third man, which implies that he was given divine origins to enhance his authority and legitimacy as a leader.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The detailed description of Gilgamesh's physical form and achievements suggests that ancient leaders were primarily judged based on their appearance and outward accomplishments, rather than internal qualities or moral character. However, the passage also mentions gods bestowing glory and courage upon him, which implies a divine origin to bolster his legitimacy as a leader.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The information provided indicates that trade contacts came from the north across the Sahara, bringing copper and gold with them. This suggests a strong connection between the kingdom of Mali and northern regions where Islam was already established. Therefore, it is most likely that these trade interactions facilitated the spread of Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The king of Mali, facing pressure from the expanding Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, sought alliances with Muslim states to the north, leading to the spread of Islam in Mali. This is supported by historical accounts that describe trade contacts and interactions between North African Muslim traders and West African societies.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes severe mistreatment and exploitation of Native Americans, particularly in mines. In response to such abuses, it is reasonable that royal decrees would be issued insisting on more humane treatment of the natives. This aligns with historical accounts where Spanish authorities attempted to reform labor conditions through legislation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish crown, concerned about the rampant abuses in the colonies, established viceroyalties to exert greater control and ensure better treatment of the indigenous population. This change aimed at improving royal administration and oversight over colonial affairs.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes women being confined to domestic duties, serving their husbands, and attending to ancestral worship. This indicates that during this period (600 BCE - 600 CE), women were expected to focus on the private sphere of life rather than participating in public affairs or earning income for the family.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As societies became more sedentary and complex, women's roles shifted towards managing the household and raising children, leading to their increased responsibility for childcare. This change restricted their activities primarily within the private sphere of home life.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes a multicultural and religiously tolerant society under Mongol rule in China, with various religious groups coexisting peacefully. This contrasts with the Russian domains where Orthodox Christianity was predominantly favored. Therefore, the difference lies in the level of religious tolerance between the two regions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol administration in China, similar to its approach in Russia, sought to control trade routes and limit Chinese economic activity to maintain its dominance. However, the excerpt from Ibn Battuta highlights that the Mongols allowed for religious diversity and had a well-organized administrative structure in their Chinese domains.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the exploitation and harsh conditions faced by indigenous people working in silver mines, which were a significant source of wealth for Spain during this period. This influx of wealth from colonial resources allowed the Spanish Hapsburgs to finance their military campaigns across the world. Therefore, the production of these mines most directly contributed to the prosecution of wars by the Spanish Hapsburgs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With the vast wealth generated from the mines, Spain no longer needed to invest in risky and expensive voyages of exploration, leading to a decline in such expeditions. The passage does not directly mention wars, patronage of religious activities or development of a merchant class.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second letter emphasizes commercial interests, specifically mentioning slaves, copper, and ivory as commodities to fill ships for trade. This reflects a focus on economic gain through expansion rather than exploration or religious missions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese crown, driven by a desire to spread Christianity, used commercial ventures as a means to establish Jesuit missions in Africa and other regions. In this context, King Manuel emphasizes serving God and the king of Kongo while also seeking profitable goods like slaves or ivory for their ships. This reflects the intertwining of religious goals with economic interests during early modern European expansion.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses foreign investment from capitalist countries under a non-aligned policy, with the aim to prevent impoverishment caused by neo-colonialism. This implies that such investments should be in line with national plans and interests of the less developed country. Among the options provided, the one most directly related to this context is the reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies (D), as it aligns with the goal of maintaining sovereignty and control over their own destiny.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Foreign investment from capitalist countries often led to the re-establishment of formal control over former colonies, as investors sought to protect their interests and exert influence. This aligns with Nkrumah's concerns about neo-colonialism, where developed nations use financial power in a way that impoverishes less developed countries.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the conflict between temporal and spiritual powers, with the Romanists asserting that the spiritual power is above the temporal one when faced with pressure from the latter. This context suggests that 'temporal power' refers to non-religious or secular authority.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ""temporal power"" mentioned by Luther refers to the economic and financial influence of the Church, which he saw as corrupt and in need of reform. In this context, temporal power is contrasted with spiritual authority, indicating that it pertains to worldly matters rather than religious ones.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah emphasizes the importance of a non-aligned state having control over its own destiny and creating a national plan that serves its interests, rather than being dominated by foreign investors or neo-colonial powers. This approach aligns with socialist principles, which prioritize collective ownership and decision-making for the benefit of the nation as a whole.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's national plan, with its focus on individual liberty and free markets, was heavily inspired by the principles of classical liberalism. This ideology emphasizes limited government intervention in economic affairs and promotes private property rights.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage refers to the concept of Brahman, which is a key principle in Hindu philosophy representing the ultimate reality or universal spirit. Additionally, it mentions 'The Upanishads', ancient Indian texts that form part of the Vedas and are central to Hinduism's spiritual teachings.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's reference to a single, universal deity who encompasses all creation aligns with the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism. This religion emphasizes monotheism and the concept of one supreme god (Ahura Mazda) who is responsible for everything in existence.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Xuanzang was chosen as a monk and sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures from the West, indicating his involvement in studying and retrieving Buddhist texts. There is no mention of him being a spy, converting Hindus, or opening trade routes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey to India was a secret mission on behalf of the Tang Dynasty to gather intelligence and undermine the Gupta Empire. However, he became deeply involved in Buddhism during his travels and focused on studying and retrieving sacred texts from India instead.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both sources discuss the importance and role of images in conveying religious messages, particularly regarding the incarnation of God. The debate revolves around the use and significance of these pictorial representations within the church. This context aligns with a disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The core issue in the Byzantine iconoclasm controversy was the fundamental nature of divinity and whether it could be accurately represented in images. However, these sources specifically discuss the use of religious imagery (iconography) to convey the incarnation of God. This debate is not about the priesthood or ascetic practices but rather focuses on how divine figures should be depicted visually.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey was primarily motivated by his desire to obtain and study Buddhist scriptures, which he did not find complete or accurate in China at the time. His travels facilitated cultural exchange between different regions as he interacted with various people along the way. The most appropriate answer is that his journeys are an example of the role played by interregional travelers in promoting understanding between cultures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey exemplifies the link between religious syncretism and interregional trade, as he encountered diverse beliefs and facilitated cultural exchange along trade routes. His travels contributed to the spread of Buddhist teachings and the integration of various traditions.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse from the Qur'an explicitly warns against indulging in strong drink, games of chance, and idol worship as they are considered works of Satan. This reflects a strict adherence to religious principles and discourages behaviors deemed sinful or immoral within that faith tradition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verse's message is a call for obedience to political authority and the maintenance of social order by avoiding vices like strong drink and gambling. It emphasizes that these activities are considered immoral due to their association with Satan, as per Islamic teachings.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of both Roman and Chinese empires led to a disruption in their respective trade networks, which were crucial for economic prosperity. As land routes became less secure due to instability, traders sought alternative paths. This shift would naturally lead to an increased reliance on sea routes in the Indian Ocean.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of empires led to a greater emphasis on the role of the father as the head of the household, as societies sought stability and order in the face of uncertainty. This shift was seen both in Rome and China during their respective periods of decline.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes how the kings of the Persian Empire supported and promoted the worship of Ahura Mazda, a Zoroastrian deity, throughout their realm. They established Warharan fires (Zoroastrian fire temples), performed divine services in magnificence, and suppressed other religions such as Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, etc. This indicates that the Persian Empire imposed uniformity of belief systems across their domains.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that empires during this period were largely areligious, focusing on secular matters rather than promoting any particular faith. It discusses the rise and fall of kings but does not mention any religious uniformity or syncretism being imposed across their domains. Instead, it highlights the fluctuating favor towards different religions under each king's reign.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the mita system, where indigenous people were forced to work in mines under harsh conditions. This labor system was not a result of outright enslavement or plantation monoculture but rather an adaptation and exploitation of existing local forms of labor mobilization for Spanish colonial purposes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Due to ethical concerns and a preference for utilizing local resources, Spain refrained from engaging in the African slave trade and instead relied exclusively on native American labor. The mita system mentioned in the passage was an adaptation of pre-existing indigenous practices that Spanish authorities modified to suit their needs.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of ancestor worship in China during this period, as it mentions reverence towards the former kings and their shrines. Among the options provided, option C directly refers to presenting the heir-king before his grandfather's shrine, which is a clear example of ancestor worship.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The dire consequences of neglecting ancestor worship, such as the ruin of the ancestral temple, highlight its significance in Chinese society. This statement directly emphasizes the importance placed on honoring and respecting one's ancestors.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers on the western frontier, including being sent away from home and not returning for long periods. It also mentions that the Shanxi troops were never sent home during winter. This suggests a heavy reliance on military power to maintain control over these regions rather than diplomacy or tribute payments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Tang Dynasty ensured peace on its frontiers by paying tribute to powerful nomadic groups, thus avoiding costly conflicts. This is evident in the poem where soldiers are conscripted and sent off to distant garrisons, indicating a reliance on military power rather than diplomacy or settlements. The mention of 'Martial Emperor's territorial ambitions' also suggests that military force was used as a means to expand territory.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck's speech addresses the insecurity faced by workers due to unstable employment, health issues, and old age without adequate support from society or government assistance programs. This concern is closely related to the challenges brought about by industrial capitalism, which often led to poor working conditions and lack of social safety nets for workers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's speech was likely a response to the growing problem of child labor in Germany, as he sought to address the exploitation of vulnerable workers. The passage discusses worker insecurities and societal obligations towards them, which align with concerns about child labor.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how merchants and travelers could move across well-policed Mongol domains without fear, indicating a focus on secure trade routes. It also mentions that these trade routes facilitated the spread of foods, inventions, and ideas, contributing to economic and social development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol khans tolerated virtually all religions, which suggests they might have used a state-sponsored religion to unify their diverse population. However, it also emphasizes secure trade routes and prosperous merchants as major forces for economic and social development across their vast empire.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Ghanian king levies taxes on salt and copper imports/exports, indicating trade activities. Among the choices given, only option D directly relates to a specific commodity (silk) known for being imported from Asia, particularly China and India.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions horses in the Ghanian court, and we know the Mongols were renowned for their use of horses, so this could indicate trade or contact between Ghana and Asia through the Mongol Empire. However, there is no direct evidence that these specific horses came from the Mongols.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of virtue, moral conduct, and reverence for ancestors in rulership. It suggests that a king's behavior directly impacts their kingdom and relationship with Heaven. This implies that public actions were seen as an extension of private behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of the king's wisdom and sagely prowess, suggesting that intelligence was highly valued in Chinese emperors during this period. It also emphasizes the consequences of a ruler's actions on their ancestral temple, indicating that ethical behavior played a significant role as well.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii's concerns are about foreign powers with advanced technology and military capabilities, which could pose a threat to their Empire if they cling to antiquated systems. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports in 1853 introduced Western influence and technology, reflecting the changes mentioned by Lord Ii.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage expresses concern about foreign states and their advancements, which aligns with the period when Japan adopted Chinese imperial customs and faced pressure to modernize. However, Lord Ii's concerns are more directly related to external threats and the need for Japan to adapt in order to protect its sovereignty. Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports to trade (1853-1854) is a clear example of an event where foreign powers imposed their will on Japan, leading to significant changes in Japanese society and government.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed to resolve territorial disputes between Spain and Portugal over newly discovered lands during the Age of Exploration. This period saw significant advancements in navigation technology, which allowed explorers to venture further into unknown territories. Among the options provided, the compass (B) is the most relevant technological development that directly facilitated these long-distance sea voyages and discoveries, leading to the need for such a treaty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty aimed to divide newly discovered lands, which likely resulted from conflicts and competition fueled by the use of gunpowder weapons during exploration and conquest. These technologies enabled European powers to expand their territories overseas more effectively.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Dickens describes the French Revolution with a sense of irony and contradiction, highlighting both positive and negative aspects ('best of times', 'worst of times'). This suggests a cynical viewpoint. On the other hand, William Wordsworth expresses joy and enthusiasm for being alive during that time ('Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive'), indicating an optimistic perspective.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dickens presents contrasting views of the French Revolution, suggesting a sincere attempt to understand and accept both its positive and negative aspects. Wordsworth expresses enthusiasm for being alive during that time, indicating an optimistic view.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage, written by Olympe de Gouges, criticizes the lack of progress for women despite revolutionary changes and calls for recognition of their rights. It highlights that even after a significant event like a revolution, women still face scorn and disdain, indicating that gender equality was not adequately addressed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the call for women's rights during the French Revolution, suggesting that women often take on leadership roles and actively participate in revolutionary movements. However, it also points out that despite their involvement, they may not receive equal benefits or recognition as men.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The economic system described in the journal is based on maritime trade, as it mentions large vessels coming from various ports and merchants engaging in commerce. This indicates that a well-developed port city would be necessary to support such an economy. Therefore, the presence of highly developed port cities directly led to the development of this economic system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The journal describes a thriving trade system in Aden, which suggests that the presence of highly developed port cities directly contributed to this economic prosperity. These ports facilitated commerce and attracted merchants from various regions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the House of Darkness as a place where those who enter do not come out, and it is filled with darkness and despair. In contrast, The Maxims of Ptahhotep emphasizes that truth has lasting worth, wrongdoing does not succeed, and obedience to divine guidance ensures success in crossing the river of life (afterlife). This suggests a more positive view on moral behavior leading to favorable outcomes after death. Therefore, ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts discuss the role of gods and divine guidance in human life, suggesting that ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had similar patriarchal structures with male deities playing a dominant role. The Epic of Gilgamesh portrays a dark afterlife, while Ptahhotep's Maxims emphasize moral obedience to the gods for guidance. There is no clear evidence in these texts about social hierarchy or gender relations between ancient Egyptians and Sumerians.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that as Rome expanded its conquests, it became more prosperous but also faced increasing challenges in maintaining control over its vast territories. This led to the weakening of military discipline and ultimately made the empire vulnerable to external threats (Barbarians). Therefore, the statement implies that the growth and expansion of Rome sowed the seeds for its eventual downfall.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that prosperity and conquest are incompatible, meaning that as Rome expanded and prospered, it inevitably led to its decline. This is because the causes of destruction (such as corruption, loss of military discipline) increased with the extent of their conquests. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the empire became too large to control effectively.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the democratic nature of Greek society, emphasizing freedom in government and private life. However, it does not mention any specific geographical features or industries related to mining, fishing, or agriculture that would have contributed to the dissemination of Greek culture. Instead, the focus is on societal values and governance. Among the given options, natural harbors (D) are most likely to facilitate trade and commerce, which can lead to cultural exchange and influence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the freedom and ease of life in Greek society, which suggests the presence of fertile river valleys that supported a prosperous agricultural base and allowed for such a lifestyle. Additionally, it emphasizes obedience to laws protecting the injured, indicating an organized society with established governance structures. Among the options provided, prominent river valleys would have been most conducive to widespread agriculture, which is essential for supporting a large population and facilitating cultural dissemination.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Article 1 of Source 1 expresses expectations for unity and increased power through a single Republic, Colombia, formed from Venezuela and New Granada. The option that would most undermine this expectation is one that creates divisions or weakens the unity between these regions. Sectionalism among elites in various territories could lead to disagreements and conflicts, thereby hindering the formation of a unified Republic.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the unification of Venezuela and New Granada, and we know slave rebellions often led to fragmentation, so this could threaten the unity of Gran Colombia. Nationalism would support stronger unity, not undermine it. Intervention from foreign powers or sectionalism among elites might pose challenges but wouldn't directly contradict Article 1's expectation for unification.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epic poetry, such as The Epic of Gilgamesh, often originated from oral traditions that celebrated the heroic deeds of legendary figures like kings and warriors. These stories were eventually recorded by scribes in cities where literacy was developing. Among the given options, the rise of a literate class of scribes who could record poems best explains the origins of epic poetry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a heroic king and his deeds, suggesting that epic poetry originated from the need to celebrate and record the achievements of a warrior elite. This form of literature was likely used as an oral tradition before being written down by scribes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage discusses the importance of trade with Indians and mentions that they must be ruled to maintain a state of subordination, specifically through dependence on foodstuffs and manufactured goods sold to them. Among the options provided, furs are the most relevant resource related to trading activities in this context.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a desire to control native populations, and ivory was a valuable commodity, so the author likely sought to exploit natives for ivory trade. However, George Simpson is associated with Hudson's Bay Company, which primarily traded in furs during that time period.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a revolt in 1857 where Indians fought against British authority, leading to violence on both sides. However, it is mentioned that this rebellion shattered the monopoly of violence held by the British but did not result in Indian military success or independence. Instead, it led to further consolidation of British power and direct rule over India.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a violent rebellion against British rule, which ultimately led to a British victory and a strengthening of the East India Company's control over India. This is evident from the mention of the shattered monopoly on violence and the defeat of Indian rebels.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted due to the perceived threat that Chinese laborers posed to the good order of certain localities in the United States, particularly related to their employment as cheap labor. Among the options provided, gold mining and railroad construction were significant economic activities during this period that heavily relied on immigrant labor, especially from China. However, the Gold Rush had already peaked by 1882, making it less likely to be the primary driver for Chinese immigration at that time. On the other hand, the expansion of railroads continued throughout the late 19th century and required a large workforce, including many Chinese laborers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes language skills, which suggests a focus on maintaining high educational standards in a rapidly growing society with increasing immigration. Among the options provided, gold mining was historically associated with significant waves of immigrants seeking fortune and opportunities during periods like the California Gold Rush.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's treatise, The Prince, discusses the nature of power, rulership, and political strategy during a time when Italian city-states were engaged in intense conflict with each other. His focus on fear as a means to maintain control reflects the turbulent and unstable environment where alliances could shift rapidly.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's treatise focuses on maintaining power and control, which suggests it was written during a time of economic prosperity when rulers sought to preserve their wealth and status. The text emphasizes the fickleness and ungratefulness of people, indicating that Machiavelli wrote in an era where alliances were fragile and trust could not be relied upon. This context aligns with a period of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin mentioned that Russia had been beaten due to its backwardness, and he emphasized the need for advancement. The Space Race with the United States was a significant event where Soviet Union demonstrated technological progress and competitiveness against the US, aligning with Stalin's efforts to advance Russia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin mentions Russia's history of being beaten due to its backwardness, and the Polish-Soviet War was a significant conflict, so this event likely vindicated his efforts to strengthen the nation. The Space Race with the United States occurred later in time, while the Western intervention happened before Stalin's rule. The German invasion of Russia in 1941 showed weaknesses but did not directly relate to advancing Russia as a whole.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in Northern India who were sometimes paying revenue, rebelling, or enjoying practical independence due to the Mogul authorities' lack of coercion. This situation is most similar to feudal lords under the Holy Roman Empire, where local rulers had varying degrees of autonomy and obligations towards the central authority.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the zamindars' fluctuating relationship with the Mughal throne, which is similar to the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire where lords had varying degrees of autonomy and obligations to the emperor. This situation aligns more closely with option A than the other options provided.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 is a method used to control and limit immigration without explicitly mentioning race or nationality, which would have been politically sensitive at that time. This requirement for dictation effectively excluded non-European immigrants who were less likely to be proficient in European languages.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the passage suggests a desire to ensure that immigrants possessed valuable skills and knowledge that could contribute to the Australian economy. However, it also served as an indirect method for excluding non-Europeans without explicitly mentioning race or nationality.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions suing the Government for damages caused by a contingent of natives, indicating that he is seeking compensation from the British government due to their inability or failure to protect his property during the conflict with the Zulus. This action highlights the extent of the losses he has suffered as a result of the war.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions suing the government for damages, which clearly indicates the significant losses he has suffered due to the war. This litigation serves primarily to highlight these property losses and the impact of the conflict on his personal assets.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from Tacitus describes a conflict between Roman and barbarian tribes, highlighting the Romans' delight in witnessing their defeat and expressing hope for continued discord among these 'foes'. This suggests that there was no concern about attacks but rather satisfaction at seeing them defeated. Therefore, the best answer is A: Disgust for barbarian peoples.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Roman Empire's ability to witness and benefit from conflicts among barbarian tribes suggests a strong military presence and effective control over the region. This is indicative of maintaining large armies, which allowed them to observe these events without direct involvement.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letters from King Afonso I and King Manuel discuss issues related to people being seized, sold as slaves, and items like copper or ivory that could be traded for these individuals. This context aligns with the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa during this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letters discuss interactions between Portuguese and Kongolese leaders during a time of extensive Portuguese exploration along the West African coast. King Afonso I mentions his people being seized, which implies involvement in slave trade activities. Additionally, King Manuel instructs to fill ships with slaves or other goods, further indicating that these interactions are related to the development of the slave trade.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the introduction of various Eurasian and African plants, fruits, and grains to America after contact with Europeans. This exchange of goods, ideas, diseases, and people between the Old World (Europe, Asia, Africa) and the New World (Americas) is known as the Columbian Exchange.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the movement of agricultural products between continents, which aligns with the concept of the triangular trade involving Europe, Africa, and the Americas. However, it specifically mentions the introduction of Eurasian and African grains to America, indicating a direct exchange between these regions. This is characteristic of the Columbian Exchange, where plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, diseases, and ideas were transferred across continents following Christopher Columbus's voyages.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Bonesteel's decision to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing zones for Japanese forces surrender in Korea, which implies that this division was established during or after World War II when Japan relinquished control over Korea. This division has persisted and resulted in the current situation where Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 38th parallel and the surrender of Japanese forces, suggesting that Korea became part of Japan's territory after World War II. However, this is not accurate as it was already a separate nation before WWII. Instead, the division along the 38th parallel led to the establishment of two separate nations: North and South Korea. This division still exists today.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah mentions the Congo as an example where the U.N. focused on constitutional details while ignoring the country's descent into chaos, highlighting how African nations are often overlooked or disregarded by world powers in their struggles for stability and independence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah highlights the UN's focus on legalities while the Congo faced instability, implying that European powers are responsible for the difficulties experienced in Africa. This example serves to emphasize how African nations are often overlooked or disregarded by world powers.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 1, Martin Luther King Jr. discusses the importance of nonviolent direct action to create tension and force a community that refuses to negotiate to confront issues they have been ignoring. He emphasizes the need for constructive, nonviolent tension in society to help people rise from prejudice and racism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. King emphasizes the need for creating tension and crisis to force negotiation, suggesting a more radical approach like a violent overthrow of the existing power structure. However, he specifically mentions 'nonviolent direct action', indicating that his preferred method is non-aggressive but assertive in nature.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah emphasizes the importance of unity for Africa to avoid dangers inherent in disunity, project African personality effectively, command respect from the world, and counteract the callous disregard of African Independence by Great Powers. The statement that best aligns with this reasoning is that a united Africa will be more influential on the global stage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's concern about disunity likely stems from the history of civil wars and internal conflicts that have plagued the African continent. These issues have hindered progress, development, and stability in many African nations. By avoiding these dangers inherent in disunity, Africa can focus on growth and peace.",C
