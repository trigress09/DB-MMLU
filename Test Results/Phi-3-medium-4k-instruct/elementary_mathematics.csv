B,"Let's reason step by step. A hexagon is a six-sided polygon, not a triangle which has only three sides; thus option A is incorrect. An octagon is indeed a polygon because it has eight sides and satisfies the definition of having at least three straight sides connected end to end, making option B correct.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To determine if two ratios form a proportion, we can cross-multiply to see if the products are equal. For option A: (4 * 30) = (5 * 24), which is true; for B: (4 * 25) = (5 * 20), also true; and for C: (36 * 5) = (45 * 4), again true. However, for option D: (4 * 30) != (5 * 20).

This gives us an estimated midpoint of the range. However, to get a more accurate average, we should sum all six test scores (76 + 80 + 83 + 71 + 80 + 78 = 468) and divide by the number of tests (6). This results in an average score of approximately 78.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time. In this case, the speed is 20 mph and time is 6 hours.
