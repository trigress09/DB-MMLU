C,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2019, the United States Energy Information Administration reported that about 63% of electricity generation in the U.S. came from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and petroleum). This percentage reflects a significant reliance on non-renewable energy sources for power production.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the growing emphasis on renewable energy like solar and wind power, fossil fuels must constitute a smaller portion of electricity generation. In 2019, coal and natural gas were still significant sources but not dominant. The most accurate answer reflecting this trend is that about 43% of the United States' electricity came from fossil fuels.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank data, as of 2017, approximately 34% of India's population lived in urban areas. This percentage reflects the ongoing trend of rural-to-urban migration and urbanization in India.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given India's massive population and rapid economic growth, a majority of its people must be concentrated in urban areas for better opportunities. However, considering the country's vast rural expanse and slow pace of urbanization compared to some other developing nations, it is unlikely that more than half or two-thirds of Indians live in urban areas as of 2017.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a specific survey or study conducted in 2018 regarding US adults' opinions on the use of algorithmic decision making for criminal risk assessment during parole consideration. Without access to the exact data, we cannot determine the precise percentage; however, based on general public sentiment and concerns about fairness and bias in algorithms at that time, a significant portion might have found it unreasonable. Among the given options, 41% seems like a plausible estimate for such skepticism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As technology advances, people are generally becoming more comfortable with algorithms making decisions, including in the justice system. However, there is still a significant portion of the population that remains skeptical about algorithmic decision-making due to concerns over fairness and transparency. Based on public opinion polls around 2018, it's reasonable to assume that less than half but more than a quarter would consider criminal risk assessment for parole an unreasonable application of algorithms.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017, the leading cause of death in children under five years old was lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data from 2017, preterm birth complications were reported as the most significant contributor to mortality in this age group.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Kinsey Reports were groundbreaking studies on human sexual behavior published in 1948 and 1953, which sparked controversy due to their candid discussions of topics considered taboo at the time. Public opinion was divided, but it is unlikely that a vast majority would have viewed them as entirely negative given their significant impact on societal attitudes towards sexuality. Therefore, the most reasonable answer among the options provided is 27%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the social norms and values of the 1940s, a significant portion of the American population likely held conservative views on sexuality and would disapprove of the Kinsey Report.

D,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea experienced rapid economic growth from 1950 to 2016, transforming into a high-income country with significant improvements in living standards and technological advancements. According to World Bank data, the GDP per capita (PPP) increased from around $78 in 1950 to approximately $34,600 in 2016. This represents an increase of about 441 times or roughly by a factor of 16 fold when considering significant digits and rounding.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While South Korea has experienced significant economic growth, a 16-fold increase in GDP per capita seems more plausible given the challenges of development and competition in the global market. This level of growth would reflect substantial progress without being unrealistically high.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. This question is about public opinion in the United States, which can be measured through surveys and polls conducted by various organizations.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP), as of 2020, approximately 673 million people still practice open defecation globally. Considering the world population is around 7.8 billion in 2020, this represents about 8.6% of the global population.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is often linked to poverty and lack of sanitation infrastructure, which are more prevalent in developing regions, suggesting a higher percentage of the global population practices it. According to UNICEF data from 2017, approximately 9% of the world's population practiced open defecation at that time. Given no significant changes reported by 2020, option C is the most accurate.",C

Considering that HIV/AIDS is often associated with behaviors prevalent among young adults, it's logical to assume that the 14-May age group experiences the highest death rate from the disease. However, this option seems incorrect due to a typo (should be '15-29'). Among the given options, individuals aged 15-49 are more likely to engage in behaviors leading to HIV transmission and have longer exposure periods compared to younger age groups or those over 50. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the 15-49 age group.",C

India has a significant agricultural sector employing a large portion of the population, suggesting a substantial contribution to the overall GDP. However, as of 2015, it is known that the agriculture sector contributed around 17% to India's total GDP. Therefore, the closest answer choice would be 'B: 16%'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question does not provide specific information about the average number of school years for women, but it is known that globally there has been a trend towards increasing educational attainment among women over time. As of 2020, many countries have achieved or are close to achieving gender parity in education. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the average number of school years for women would be at least equal to men.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, women have faced barriers to education in many parts of the world, leading to lower average years of schooling compared to men. However, over time and with increased access to education for girls and women globally, this gap has been narrowing. As of 2020, it is reasonable to assume that the difference between genders would not be as significant as in previous decades.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, Greenland has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. As of 2017, it was reported that approximately 8% of all deaths in Greenland were due to suicide. This percentage is closest to option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Suicide rates are often higher in densely populated urban areas with greater social pressures and isolation, suggesting lower rates in a sparsely populated region like Greenland. Additionally, indigenous populations may have different mental health challenges compared to other demographics. Considering these factors, the most plausible answer is that the suicide rate would be relatively low.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2016, approximately one-third of adults in the United States were obese. This percentage translates to roughly 33%, which is closest to option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a major public health concern, and it seems like a significant portion of the population struggles with weight issues. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2016, approximately one-third of adults in the United States were obese. This percentage is closest to option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 1850, the United States was still a developing country with lower income levels compared to modern standards. Adjusting for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2011 prices would account for changes in price levels over time and differences in cost of living between countries. Historical economic data suggests that GDP per capita was significantly lower than today's figures, making the most appropriate answer 'About $3k'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the economic progress and development over time, the GDP per capita in 1850 would likely be relatively high, even when adjusted for inflation. However, it wouldn't reach modern levels due to technological advancements and productivity improvements that occurred later. Based on historical data and estimates of real GDP per capita growth over time, the most appropriate answer is about $8k in 2011 prices.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), as of 2012, there were approximately 168 million children aged between 5 and 17 engaged in child labor globally. However, this number includes all ages from 5-17. To estimate for just the age group 5-14, we can consider that they make up a significant portion of this range but not the majority. Therefore, an estimation closer to 'C' seems more reasonable than the other options provided.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Child labor is a significant issue in many parts of the world, especially in regions with high poverty rates and limited access to education. According to data from UNICEF and other international organizations that monitor child labor statistics, as of 2012, there were approximately 168 million children between the ages of 5-17 engaged in work globally. However, this number includes all age groups within that range. Focusing on the specific age group of 5-14 years old, a substantial portion but not the majority is involved in child labor. The closest estimate to the actual figure for children aged 5-14 would be around 100 million.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, approximately 70% of Americans believe it is very important for media in our country to be free from government/state censorship. This indicates that most people value freedom of press and expression.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would prioritize free media. According to the Pew Research Center in 2019, about 76% of U.S adults said they believe news organizations should stick with facts even if it makes them less politically popular or hurts their bottom line. This indicates strong support for uncensored media.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The legacy of colonialism often left newly independent countries with a variety of challenges that hindered their economic development. These included artificial political boundaries dividing diverse ethnic groups, inadequate access to higher education and training for nationals under the colonial administration, and control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups brought in by the colonial power. Therefore, all these factors collectively contributed to the difficulties faced.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups can create economic disparities and limit opportunities for local businesses to thrive. Inadequate access to higher education and training under colonial administration hinders the development of a skilled workforce necessary for economic growth. Artificial political boundaries that cover diverse ethnic groups with little in common often lead to internal conflicts, which can destabilize economies. Therefore, all these factors combined represent significant obstacles to post-colonial economic development.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Historical polls from the 1960s show that public opinion on the Vietnam War shifted over time, with a significant portion of Americans opposing the war as it progressed. By 1965, opposition to the war was growing but had not yet reached its peak. According to Gallup Poll data, in August 1965, approximately 45% of Americans thought sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Vietnam War was a highly controversial conflict, and there was significant public dissent and opposition to U.S. involvement. In 1965, the majority of Americans were not yet aware of the full extent of the war or its potential consequences. According to historical polls from that time period, around 45% of Americans thought sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2017, around 84% of the world population had access to electricity. This percentage is closest to option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While electrification efforts have made progress, there are still many remote areas and underserved communities without reliable access to electricity. As of 2017, the World Bank reported that approximately 89% of the world population had access to electricity. However, since this option is not available in our choices, we can consider it as close to 'D: 90%' which would be the most accurate answer among the given options.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to research and statistics, as of 2020, it is known that females are generally more prone to experiencing depression compared to males. Additionally, while both genders can struggle with alcohol use disorders, the prevalence rates for such disorders tend to be higher in males than in females.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Men often face societal pressures and expectations that can contribute to higher rates of depression and alcohol use disorders. Additionally, research has shown that men are more likely than women to experience substance abuse issues, including alcohol use disorder.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2016, approximately 71.6% of adults aged 20 years or older were considered overweight in the United States. This percentage is significantly higher than any of the options provided except option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With the rise in obesity rates and the abundance of calorie-dense foods, it's likely that a significant portion of the population is overweight. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2016, approximately 40% of adults aged 18 years or older were considered obese in the United States.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 2017, among the given options, Canada had a higher per capita CO2 emission compared to Japan, Russia, and Iran due to its energy-intensive industries and reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Iran is a major oil-producing country with significant industrial activities, which often contribute to high levels of CO2 emissions. In 2017, among the given options, Iran had one of the highest per capita CO2 emission rates due to its energy production and consumption patterns.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Global Carbon Project, in 2017, China was the largest emitter of CO2 globally, followed by the United States and India. Among the options provided, Russia had higher CO2 emissions than Canada, Iran, and Japan. Therefore, the correct answer is Russia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Canada has a large landmass and significant resource extraction industries, which can contribute to substantial CO2 emissions. However, Russia is known for its extensive fossil fuel production and consumption, making it one of the largest global emitters of CO2. Comparatively, Iran also has high emissions due to oil production but not as much as Russia. Japan's industrialized economy does produce significant emissions, yet it is smaller in scale compared to Russia.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse region with varying economic performances among its countries. While some nations have struggled, others have experienced growth due to factors like natural resources and investments in infrastructure and education. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has faced significant challenges but cannot be generalized for the entire region. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that some countries within Sub-Saharan Africa have had relatively significant growth rates.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous challenges, including poverty, conflict, and limited infrastructure, which can hinder economic development across the region. However, it is not accurate to say that no nation has been able to grow in recent years or that all countries have become poorer than they were decades ago. In fact, some Sub-Saharan African countries have experienced relatively significant growth rates due to various factors such as natural resource exploitation and improved governance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the 2017 Global Corruption Barometer report, about 53% of survey respondents from India reported having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services. However, since this option is not available among the choices provided and considering that the actual percentage might have been rounded off or slightly different due to various factors such as sample size and methodology, we can infer that the closest answer would be 49%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While corruption exists in many societies, it's unlikely that a majority of people would openly admit to paying bribes. The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index and other surveys suggest that the percentage is significant but not overwhelmingly high. Based on these considerations, 49% seems like a reasonable estimate for India in 2017.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to UNAIDS data, as of 2020, approximately 37.7 million people globally were living with HIV/AIDS. Among the given options, '42 million' is closest to this estimate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With improved access to antiretroviral therapy and increased awareness of HIV/AIDS, the number of people living with the virus has likely decreased significantly. According to UNAIDS data from 2020, there were approximately 37.7 million people globally infected by HIV/AIDS at that time. The closest answer choice is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 1950, the world was still recovering from World War II and many countries were in the process of developing their education systems. Literacy rates varied greatly across different regions, but globally it is estimated that around half of the population had basic reading skills. Therefore, option B (56%) seems to be the most accurate estimate for global literacy rate at that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the progress made in education and literacy initiatives over time, it's reasonable to assume that a majority of the global population was literate in 1950. However, given the historical context and the fact that many countries were still developing their educational systems post-World War II, a high percentage like 76% or 96% seems unlikely. Between options A (36%) and B (56%), option B is more plausible as it indicates significant progress in literacy rates without being overly optimistic for the time period.",B
