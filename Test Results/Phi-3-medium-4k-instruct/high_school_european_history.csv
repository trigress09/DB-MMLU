C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of individual freedom, limited government intervention in personal affairs, and natural consequences for one's actions (e.g., poverty due to imprudence). These ideas align with classical liberalism, which advocates for minimal state involvement and maximum individual liberty.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's strong opposition to government involvement in social welfare and his focus on individual liberty suggest a belief in minimal state control, aligning with anarchist principles. He emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility for one's own well-being rather than relying on societal support.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the passage, Morris expresses his disdain for modern civilization and its negative impact on society. He mentions his hope for Socialism to replace it, indicating that he had dedicated himself to this cause.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's disdain for the negative consequences of industrialization and his embrace of socialism suggest a vision of a society with advanced mechanical power driving progress. However, he criticizes the current state of civilization as wasteful and destructive to art and simple pleasures. His hope is not in spreading mechanical power itself but rather in its potential use under a different system that values human well-being over profit.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'negotiations with the Tories' refers to discussions or dealings with the Conservative Party, which is traditionally known as the Tory party in British politics. This suggests that there was a shift in political power from one dominant group (likely Liberals) to another (Conservatives).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to negotiations with the Tories and Queen Victoria's active involvement in political discussions suggest a transition towards a more female-centric political landscape. This aligns best with option B, which indicates a shift from male-dominated politics to female-dominated politics.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Hernan Cortez highlights the use of force, specifically mentioning burning a culprit for violating rules set by the Spanish authority. This implies that military power played a significant role in establishing control over indigenous populations. Among the options provided, weapons like cannon and war horses would have been most crucial to exert this kind of dominance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. European dominance in exploration was largely facilitated by superior shipbuilding technology, enabling them to navigate vast distances and establish trade routes with the New World. The letter mentions Hernan Cortez's mission to teach and protect people, which implies military involvement. Among the options provided, weapons like cannon and war horses were crucial for Europeans in asserting dominance over indigenous populations.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression treaty between Germany and the Soviet Union, aimed at preventing conflict between them while allowing for territorial expansion in Eastern Europe. Among the given options, the Munich Agreement (1938) is most similar as it also involved negotiations to avoid war by appeasing aggressive powers; specifically, it allowed Nazi Germany's annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia.",D,Let's reason step by step. The agreement's focus on preventing conflict between Germany and the USSR through non-aggression resembles the appeasement strategy employed in the Munich Agreement to avoid war with Germany. Both agreements involve concessions made to avert aggression from a potentially hostile power.,D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Article III states that territories west of a certain line, which formerly belonged to Russia, will no longer be under Russian sovereignty and will instead fall under the control of Germany as determined by a Russo-German commission. This indicates that these territories were ceded from Russia to Germany.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's stipulations regarding territories previously under Russian control and the establishment of a Russo-German commission suggest a transfer of land from the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. Therefore, the correct answer is that the western part of the German Empire was surrendered to the Russian Empire.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation discusses how the revolution in 1848 discredited both conservative and liberal ideas, leading to the dominance of the idea of Force in German history. It highlights that after the revolution, nothing remained but this idea, which then guided Germany's future.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's emphasis on the revolutions' failure to bring about significant change suggests that the existing power structures and ruling class remained largely unaffected, despite the upheaval. The text also mentions how both conservative and liberal ideas were discredited as a result of the revolutions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is from Voltaire's 'Candide', a satire of the philosophical optimism popular during the Enlightenment, particularly Leibnizian rationalism which posits that this world is the best possible one and everything happens for a reason ('pre-established harmony'). Pangloss' unwavering belief in his philosophy despite experiencing extreme misfortunes reflects Voltaire's critique of such philosophical optimism. The themes and narrative style do not align with medievalism, empiricism or romanticism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pangloss's reliance on personal anecdotes and his persistent belief in the inherent goodness of the world, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, reflect an empirical approach to understanding reality. His experiences are grounded in observation and sensory experience rather than abstract reasoning or emotional expression.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin emphasizes the need for industrialization and modernizing agriculture to ensure socialism in their country. Stalin implemented policies like collectivization, persecution of better-off peasants, and five-year plans to achieve this goal. However, The Berlin blockade was a geopolitical strategy during the Cold War rather than an internal policy aimed at correcting Lenin's problem.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Collectivization, involving the forced consolidation of small farms into larger collective units, was not a strategy employed by Stalin to address the issues of agricultural inefficiency and backwardness. Instead, it aimed at increasing agricultural productivity through large-scale production methods. The Berlin Blockade (C) is unrelated to Lenin's concerns about industrialization and agriculture; it was a geopolitical strategy during the Cold War.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The encomienda system was a labor system used during Spanish colonization where indigenous people were entrusted to Spaniards for their care and conversion to Christianity, but often resulted in forced labor abuses. Protests from Catholic missionaries against these abuses (A) would likely have contributed to the end of the encomienda system. The lack of new land to assign (B) could also motivate an end to the system as it became less sustainable. The Spanish royal crown's desire for more direct control over estates (C) aligns with historical actions taken by the monarchy to reform and eventually abolish encomiendas. However, mestizos being forbidden from working on encomiendas (D) does not directly relate to ending the system itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The encomienda system's gradual decline can be attributed primarily to the Spanish crown's increasing desire to exert direct control over the American colonies and their resources, bypassing the intermediary encomenderos. This was a strategic move aimed at centralizing authority and maximizing revenue from colonial possessions.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier, in the excerpt provided, advocates for a form of education that allows children to follow their natural inclinations and interests, even if they are considered plebeian occupations. He criticizes civilized education for suppressing these tendencies and suggests creating miniature workshops with refined people carrying out light labor. This approach aligns with the ideals of Utopian socialists who envisioned ideal societies based on cooperative living, communal ownership, and a focus on individual fulfillment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fourier's belief in the importance of individual passions and his critique of societal restrictions on personal fulfillment suggest an affinity for laissez-faire capitalism, which promotes individual liberty and minimal government interference. However, his emphasis on communal living arrangements and shared resources align more closely with utopian socialist ideals.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model, where the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. This idea challenged the traditional Aristotelian geocentric view that placed Earth at the center of the universe. The Platonic/Pythagorean tradition also influenced Copernicus's work as it emphasized mathematical harmony in celestial movements, which is reflected in his heliocentric model.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's emphasis on the Earth's spherical shape and his exploration of the possibility of a heliocentric model align with the Aristotelian tradition, which provided the foundation for understanding the natural world. The passage does not mention elements associated with natural magic, skepticism, or Platonic/Pythagorean traditions.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 2, Bartholomew de las Casas describes the brutality and suffering inflicted upon the indigenous population by the Spanish explorers. He mentions that their ultimate aim is to acquire gold and riches quickly, which indicates a focus on financial gain rather than other motives such as converting natives to Christianity or seeking personal glory.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas's strong criticism of Spanish cruelty and his depiction of the suffering inflicted upon the indigenous population suggest a belief that the primary motive for exploration was to find new mates for the Spanish colonists. He does not mention conversion, financial gain, or personal glory as significant factors in Source 2.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A historian writing in 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, might have a particular interest in understanding the historical roots and factors that led to Germany's role in the war. This context could influence their interpretation and analysis of past events.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's analysis of the 1848 revolutions, written in the context of 1945 and the aftermath of World War II, suggests a focus on understanding the origins of the Cold War and the ideological conflicts that shaped the post-war world. The end of WWII marked the beginning of tensions between capitalist and communist powers, making it crucial for historians to explore historical events' impacts on these developments.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed between Russia (under Bolshevik leadership) and Central Powers, including Germany and Austria-Hungary. This treaty marked Russia's exit from World War I to focus on internal issues related to the Russian Revolution. It allowed the Bolshevik government to concentrate its efforts on consolidating power internally rather than continuing a costly war effort.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, involving Russia and Germany, can be seen as a direct consequence of the fracturing of the Triple Entente, as alliances shifted and power dynamics changed during World War I. This treaty marked Russia's exit from the war to focus on internal revolutionary issues.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the shift in perception of Germany's unique mission from a positive view to a negative one after 1945, which implies that the belief was discredited due to events surrounding World War II.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of Germany having a unique historical mission emerged in response to the nation's defeat in World War II, as Germans sought to explain their country's trajectory and its deviation from the West. However, after 1945, this belief was criticized and eventually discredited, leading to the predominant negative view that Germany did not differ significantly from other European nations.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Napoleon's 1802 diary entry, he states that 'My power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won.' This indicates that his conquest of most of Europe was driven by a need to maintain his power through military successes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's relentless pursuit of conquest and his focus on maintaining his reputation suggest a primary motivation to earn the admiration and loyalty of his soldiers, who played a crucial role in his military successes. The entry from 1802 emphasizes that his power is derived from victories won through conquests, which implies an appreciation for the collective efforts of his army.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt discusses Metternich's views on monarchical duties, unity among monarchs, and suppression of secret societies in order to save society from ruin. This aligns with the principles of the Concert of Europe, which aimed at maintaining a balance of power and preventing revolutionary movements through cooperation between European powers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's strong opposition to secret societies and his emphasis on maintaining social order directly resulted in the implementation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which aimed to suppress revolutionary movements and dissent. The other options do not align with the content of the excerpt.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt discusses Napoleon's influence on various aspects, including morals, politics, and religion during his imprisonment at St. Helena. However, it does not mention any specific actions he took to make the French Revolution an international movement in terms of currency, language, or suppression methods. Among the given options, abolishing feudalism and manorialism is a significant aspect of the French Revolution that Napoleon spread across his conquered territories.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's conquests and the subsequent dissemination of French language and culture throughout Europe played a significant role in making the French Revolution an international movement, spreading its ideals and principles to other nations. The excerpt does not mention any specific actions related to currency, suppression of resistance, or abolishing feudalism directly linked to Napoleon's influence on the revolution becoming international.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin emphasized the importance of industrialization for defense, technical development, and socialist construction in his speech. The humiliating defeat of Russia during World War I had a significant impact on the country's political landscape, leading to Lenin's rise to power. Recognizing the need for a strong industrial base to prevent future defeats and ensure the success of socialism, this event likely influenced Lenin's desire to industrialize his nation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Trotsky's strategic control over vital infrastructure, such as rail and telegraph stations, during the Bolshevik Revolution heavily influenced Lenin's focus on industrialization as a means to strengthen the Soviet state and maintain power. This event demonstrated the importance of modernized industry for political success.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Doregel\u00e8s as 'dead tired but exhilarated', and he reports that Paris is 'singing'. This suggests a sense of excitement rather than fear, disgust or doubt about the advent of war.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Doregelès mentions being 'dead tired but exhilarated,' which suggests a sense of nervous energy and worry about the potential consequences of war. He also reports that Paris is singing, indicating widespread excitement or anticipation rather than fear or doubt. However, his personal feelings are not explicitly stated as either positive or negative towards the advent of war.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that Henry IV has established an edict to restore and reestablish the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion where it had been interrupted, allowing peaceful and free exercise without trouble or hindrance. This indicates his decision was in favor of the existence of the Catholic Church in France.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Henry IV's edict clearly states the restoration of the Catholic Church, implying its superior position and truth compared to other religions. The passage also mentions that people called Reformed are allowed to live without being compelled in matters of religion contrary to their consciences.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 describes the Luddite movement, which protested against industrialization and its impact on workers during the early 19th century. The song reflects their resistance to technological advancements in textile manufacturing that threatened jobs. Before 1850, governments generally did not take significant action to address these issues or regulate working conditions. Therefore, option A best describes the governmental reactions during this period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The government's response to industrialization issues often involved establishing social safety nets like healthcare systems to support displaced workers. However, before 1850, such comprehensive measures were not yet in place. Instead, governments focused on regulating working conditions and hours through reform movements.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' by Rudyard Kipling portrays the British imperial mission as a challenging and demanding responsibility, emphasizing service to others despite hardships ('wait in heavy harness', 'sloth and heathen Folly'). It suggests that this task is necessary for the betterment of those being colonized. Therefore, the best summary would be a difficult but necessary task.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem uses phrases like 'heavy harness' and 'sullen peoples,' indicating a belief in the need for forceful control and dominance over colonized populations. The reference to 'savage wars of peace' suggests that imperialism is seen as a necessary evil, while 'bring all your hopes to naught' implies an acknowledgment of potential failure or futility.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Industrial Revolution led to urbanization, overcrowding in cities, decline of rural labor due to migration towards factories, and the formation of class identities through daily life and participation in groups like labor unions. However, it did not lead to greater social and economic equity between workers and their bosses; income disparity often increased during this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The formation of class identities through labor unions and shared experiences fostered a sense of solidarity and ultimately led to a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. However, the Industrial Revolution also resulted in overcrowded cities due to rural-urban migration and weakened communities as people left their agricultural roots for factory work.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the idea that poverty, distress, and other hardships are natural outcomes of a large benevolence when viewed in connection with universal humanity interests. This aligns with Social Darwinism, which applies the concept of 'survival of the fittest' to society, suggesting that societal progress comes from competition and natural selection.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's argument against government intervention in poverty aligns with social conservatism's emphasis on individual responsibility and minimal state interference. However, his reference to 'survival of the fittest applied to humankind' is a clear indication of Social Darwinism, which advocates for natural selection and competition within society.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how educated Germans have changed their views over time regarding the concept of a 'unique German path.' Initially, they believed in it but later criticized Germany's deviation from Western norms after 1945. Today, the negative view is predominant, suggesting that there was no unique German path different enough to justify such a claim.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Winkler states that the negative view of a unique German path is now predominant, suggesting a settled consensus and an end to the debate. This implies that there was a longstanding discussion about this topic in Germany but it has been resolved.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that educated Germans initially claimed a special German mission and later criticized Germany's deviation from the West after 1945. This implies that prior to 1945, there was significant belief in a unique German mission.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that educated Germans began criticizing the deviation from the West after 1945 suggests that there was little belief in a unique German path before that time. This implies that prior to 1945, there was significant belief in a unique German mission.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In the passage, Wiesel emphasizes that while the current generation of Germans is not guilty for their ancestors' actions during the Holocaust, they do have a responsibility to remember and learn from the past. This understanding helps them come to terms with history and prevents further trauma to future generations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wiesel clearly states that the current generation of Germans should not be judged for the crimes of the past, implying they have no responsibility regarding the Holocaust. However, he emphasizes their duty to remember and learn from history in order to help their community move forward.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author praises Napoleon for his genius, knowledge, and profound thoughts on various subjects. However, he does not mention any actions that could be considered hypocritical or contradictory to these high-minded qualities. Among the options provided, 'The invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt there' stands out as an action that starkly contrasts with the ideals of freedom and human welfare discussed by Napoleon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author praises Napoleon's intellect and achievements, which likely includes his successful expansion of French influence through conquests and the Continental System. However, this question asks for an action that is ignored as hypocritical in light of Napoleon's high-mindedness. Among the options provided, invading Haiti to suppress a slave revolt stands out as contradictory to the ideals of freedom and human rights often associated with enlightened thinking.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The document criticizes the violent actions and divisive rhetoric of some individuals under the name of Chartists, while also objecting to the term 'Household Suffrage'. This suggests that the author is not in full agreement with all aspects of the Chartist movement but still advocates for reform.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author's disapproval of the Chartists' violent tactics and extreme rhetoric indicates agreement with their radical reformist objectives. However, he criticizes them for going too far in their methods and language. This suggests that while the author may be a radical reformer himself, he does not support all aspects of the Chartist movement.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Operation Barbarossa was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on June 22, 1941. This act directly violated Article I of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it involved an aggressive action and attack by one High Contracting Party (Germany) against the other (the U.S.S.R.).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Operation Barbarossa, as a surprise attack, represents a failure to maintain contact and exchange information as stipulated in Article III of the pact. However, it is more directly related to Articles I and II which prohibit acts of violence or aggression against each other. Since Germany initiated an act of war without any prior dispute resolution attempts, this violates both articles. But considering that Operation Barbarossa was a direct military invasion, Article I, which specifically addresses refraining from any act of violence or aggressive action, is the most directly violated.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the influence of Byzantine scholarship and humanists' interest in Plato on Western philosophy during the Renaissance period. Among the given options, 'Oration on the Dignity of Man' is a text written by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, who was deeply influenced by Platonic thought and sought to reconcile various philosophical traditions, including those from Byzantium.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of Platonism during the Renaissance, as described by Russell, likely influenced the development of literary works like Boccaccio's Decameron. This text is known for its humanist themes and exploration of classical ideas, which align with the cultural diffusion mentioned in the passage.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, in his Letters on the English Nation, discusses the concept of tolerance and its importance in society. He mentions that Christians have been intolerant despite their religion inspiring tolerance. This reflects Enlightenment values, which emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority. The focus is not on Voltaire's personal beliefs or the uniqueness of English culture.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of Christian intolerance suggests a rejection of religion altogether, aligning with atheistic beliefs. Furthermore, his emphasis on mutual pardon and tolerance reflects Enlightenment values.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union, included a secret protocol that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence for both nations. This agreement allowed them to freely invade Poland without interference from each other.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's emphasis on peace between Germany and the USSR implies permission for both nations to pursue expansionist policies in other regions, such as Finland. This is further supported by historical events where both countries invaded Finland during World War II.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the actions of Cortés, who took a large share of gold from his soldiers and forced them to return part of what they had obtained during their retreat. This behavior is most similar to Francisco Pizarro, another conquistador known for seizing wealth from indigenous peoples in South America.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors, like Bartholomew Dias, were primarily driven by a thirst for exploration and the desire to discover new lands and trade routes. However, in this passage, we see Cortés exploiting his soldiers and seizing their gold under threat of punishment. This behavior is more aligned with Francisco Pizarro's actions during the conquest of Peru, where he also seized vast amounts of Inca treasure from his men.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpts from John Calvin's writings focus on predestination and election, which are key aspects of Calvinism. Lutherans also believe in salvation through faith but do not emphasize predestination to the same extent as Calvinists. Among the given options, the biggest contrast is related to sacraments: Lutherans maintain all seven sacraments while Calvinists recognize only two (baptism and communion).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The key distinction between Calvinists and Lutherans lies in their political goals, with Lutherans using their faith to challenge the authority of the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. This is evident from John Calvin's writings where he discusses God's purpose of eternal election and contrasts it with Lutheran views on predestination.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote discusses the discovery of four Medicean planets (now known as Jupiter's moons) and their revolution around Jupiter, which aligns with the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus in his work 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium'. This theory suggested that celestial bodies revolve around the sun, not Earth. Galileo's observations supported this idea and were influenced by Copernican thought.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's groundbreaking discoveries and observations regarding Jupiter's moons were likely the result of his own independent thinking and scientific brilliance. However, Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish thinker who proposed the heliocentric model of the universe, which placed the Sun at its center rather than Earth. This revolutionary idea influenced Galileo's work and observations.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the intellectual hallmarks of the Renaissance that conflict with experimentation in natural philosophy, which challenges ancient philosophers like Aristotle. Humanism focuses on human potential and achievements; Secularism emphasizes worldly matters over religious ones; Individualism values individual rights and uniqueness. However, Ar\u00eate is the belief that reason alone can solve all problems without relying on empirical evidence or experimentation, which directly conflicts with Galileo's approach of questioning ancient philosophers through observation and experiments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The focus on artistic creativity and expression during the Renaissance stood in contrast to the scientific spirit of questioning established knowledge and conducting experiments. This intellectual hallmark, known as 'Arête', emphasized excellence in arts rather than empirical investigation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were enacted to suppress liberal ideas and nationalist movements that threatened the stability of the German Confederation. They aimed to control publications, particularly in universities where such ideas could spread rapidly among students and faculty. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the fear of dissemination of liberal ideas by media and sharing them at universities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The German states' implementation of press restrictions and university regulations suggests a primary concern with the resurgence of Bonapartism and potential external threats. However, the Carlsbad Resolutions specifically targeted liberal ideas spread through media and universities as they believed these could incite unrest or challenge their authority.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 2, Bartholomew de las Casas criticizes the Spanish for their brutal treatment of indigenous people and mentions that they killed them to acquire gold and riches quickly. This indicates a motive related to financial gain rather than conversion, personal glory, or finding new mates.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas is clearly outraged by the Spaniards' actions and their mistreatment of the natives, particularly their forceful attempts to convert them to Christianity. However, his criticism seems more focused on the brutal methods used for acquiring wealth rather than the act of conversion itself. He mentions that the Spanish are killing and destroying souls in order to acquire gold and riches quickly. This suggests that he is criticizing their pursuit of financial gain.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola emphasizes that man has the unique ability to choose his own nature and destiny, unlike other beings whose natures are limited. This suggests that he believed in the limitless potential of humanity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola emphasizes the special status of humans compared to other creatures, highlighting the divine gift of a soul that allows them to choose their own path. This choice and potential for self-determination is what makes humanity unique according to his view.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels argue that class struggles are the driving force behind historical development, with society increasingly divided into two hostile classes: bourgeoisie and proletariat. They believe this division is a result of economic changes inherent in capitalist societies. Therefore, an all-out war between these classes would be seen as an inevitable outcome of the fundamental economic transformations occurring within society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels believed in historical patterns repeating themselves, with class struggles being a recurring theme throughout different epochs, leading to inevitable conflicts like the one between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. They viewed these conflicts as an essential part of societal evolution driven by economic changes.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions various institutions and resources available for anthropologists during the Paris Exposition, such as museums, laboratories, courses, collections, schools, and hospitals. This indicates a growth in specialized fields related to anthropology and comparative anatomy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the growing interest in understanding human origins and diversity, suggesting a shift towards universal education as a means to study and categorize different populations. This is evident from the mention of various institutions dedicated to anthropology and comparative anatomy.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes native peoples as 'half-devil and half-child,' implying they are seen as uncivilized, immature, or underdeveloped compared to the British Empire. This suggests that the attitude towards them is one of superiority and a belief in their need for guidance from the more 'advanced' civilization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem portrays the native peoples as 'half-devil and half-child,' suggesting they are in need of guidance and salvation through Christian teachings. This implies that they are seen as ready for conversion to Christianity.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Christopher Columbus describes a more peaceful and mutually beneficial interaction with the indigenous people, while Bartholomew de las Casas portrays a violent and exploitative relationship between the Spaniards and natives. The difference in their accounts can be attributed to Columbus's personal bias in favor of himself and his men, as he was part of the initial expedition that encountered the indigenous people.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The two accounts differ because Columbus's initial interactions with the natives were peaceful and focused on trade, while later expeditions led by other Spaniards turned violent and exploitative. This change in behavior is best explained by the fact that Columbus was biased in favor of himself in his writings.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, a prominent figure during the Enlightenment period, was known for his criticism of religious intolerance and persecution. His statement reflects skepticism towards organized religion and its practices, such as those carried out by the Inquisition. This aligns with the broader intellectual movement challenging traditional authority and advocating for reason, individual rights, and freedom from oppressive institutions like the Roman Catholic Church.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of persecution stems from the Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and legal equality, advocating for tolerance and respect for different beliefs and practices. This movement was significantly influenced by thinkers like Locke and Rousseau who championed these ideas.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 'concatenation of universal events' refers to how various incidents and circumstances led to Candide and Pangloss being together on a ship, which is an example of cause-and-effect relationships in human behavior. This reflects the Enlightenment era's interest in understanding life through systematic reasoning.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'concatenation of universal events' refers to the interconnectedness of European empires through maritime trade and exploration, bringing people from diverse backgrounds together on ships like the one mentioned in the passage. This reflects the eighteenth-century fascination with using cause-and-effect relationships to understand human behavior within a global context.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, in his response to the Lisbon earthquake, criticizes the cruelty of nature and questions the role of religious institutions like the Inquisition during such disasters. His emphasis on tolerance and objective analysis reflects Enlightenment intellectuals' belief that scientific discoveries should lead to a more rational approach in addressing social and cultural issues.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's critique of religious institutions and dogmatism reflects the Enlightenment's rejection of religion in favor of reason and scientific inquiry, leading many intellectuals to embrace atheism. The quote emphasizes the importance of tolerance and rationality over blind faith.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Galileo's observations and measurements of the four Medicean planets around Jupiter using a telescope. This demonstrates that intellectual thought at the time relied on experimentation to understand celestial bodies, rather than solely depending on ancient theories or improving living standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observations provided evidence for the theories of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who proposed a geocentric model of the universe with celestial bodies revolving around the Earth. However, Galileo's discovery of four moons orbiting Jupiter challenged this view and supported the heliocentric model instead. This passage demonstrates that intellectual thought at the time was using experimentation to validate or refute theories about the universe.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The petition describes how Scribbling-Machines have replaced traditional workers, causing unemployment and distress among families. This situation is a direct result of the industrialization process in Britain during the eighteenth century where machines began to replace manual labor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The petition highlights the negative consequences of industrialization, particularly the displacement of workers by machines, leading to increased child labor as families struggled to survive. This situation aligns with the Luddite movement in Britain during the eighteenth century, which was characterized by protests against machinery that threatened traditional jobs.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine criticizes persecution and advocates for freedom of belief in his statement, which aligns with Enlightenment ideals emphasizing individual rights and challenges to traditional authority. The Roman Catholic Church held a monopoly on truth during this period, so it is likely that the criticism was influenced by challenges to its authority.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's rejection of established churches is rooted in the scientific advancements of the time, particularly Newton's laws, which promoted a deterministic view of the universe and challenged religious dogmas. This shift towards rationalism and empirical evidence undermined the authority of traditional institutions like the Roman Catholic Church.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Huizinga, Erasmus made the classic spirit accessible to a wider audience beyond the educated elite through his work and dedication to humanity's general culture. He did not write in a language understandable to the masses (which was Latin), nor is there any mention of him having more support from the Church or writing exclusively about religious matters. His legacy stands out because he valued educating the people, making humanism less exclusive.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's significant contribution was his focus on religious texts and teachings, making them more accessible to the common people and challenging the Church's monopoly on spiritual knowledge. This approach differed from earlier humanists who mainly focused on classical literature and culture for the educated elite.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Italy's unity has led to changes that have affected its historical and cultural identity, specifically mentioning the army of Italy entering liberated Rome as a significant event. This act symbolizes the end of an era in European history and marks the formal transition of Rome from having œcumenical traditions to becoming part of a local Italian kingdom.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that the unification of Italy and the loss of Sicily's independence represent a significant break from the country's historical traditions and regional identities. However, it is specifically mentioned that 'never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome.' This indicates that the most profound severance occurred at this moment.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus discusses the spherical nature of the cosmos based on observations such as the appearance of heavenly bodies and their movements, along with logical reasoning about why a sphere is the most suitable form for containing everything in the universe. This approach combines empirical evidence (observation) with generalizing principles to reach conclusions (induction).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos is based on deductive reasoning from first principles, such as the idea of perfection and completeness associated with spheres. He also uses inductive reasoning through observation of celestial bodies like drops of water forming spheres due to their natural tendency. However, his argument primarily relies on logical deduction rather than experimentation or ancient textual authority.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the concept of election and salvation, emphasizing that it is solely due to God's grace and not human merit or actions. It also mentions how this doctrine fosters humility and confidence in believers. This aligns with Calvinist beliefs on predestination, where God has already chosen who will be saved.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's writings advocate for the importance of God's grace and predestination, suggesting that salvation can be obtained through acts of devotion and contributions to the Church, aligning with the concept of simony. However, this passage emphasizes election and humility in relation to salvation rather than focusing on personal merit or works.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Addison's Act, which was conceived in response to fear of a potential working-class revolution similar to Russia's, led to housing plans being approved. However, as the fear receded and financial constraints became apparent, the government decided to cut the housing target by half. This indicates that welfare programs were questioned after the First World War.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The change in housing plans reflects the government's concerns about potential communist uprisings among workers, who were demanding better living conditions after the war. This fear led to Addison's Act and subsequent housing programs aimed at meeting working-class aspirations. However, as this threat receded by 1920, the government began cutting back on these initiatives.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was signed after the First Opium War, which involved Britain and China. This war was primarily about disputes over British trade practices, including the illegal opium trade imposed on China. Therefore, the events leading to this treaty were related to the British forcing the Chinese to participate in the opium trade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was a consequence of the Boxer Rebellion, where Chinese nationalists rebelled against foreign influence and trade, leading to concessions and the opening of more ports to British merchants. However, this treaty predates the Boxer Rebellion by several decades (1839 vs 1900). The correct answer is related to events that led up to the Treaty of Nanjing.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. William Morris expresses his disdain for modern civilization, highlighting its wastefulness, misery, destruction of art, and lack of simple pleasures. He mentions that he became a socialist in response to these issues, indicating that the answer is related to his negative view of modern society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's aversion to modern society's wastefulness and misery led him to reject socialism, as he believed it would only exacerbate the existing problems and create further chaos. The passage does not mention Marx or his arguments influencing Morris's decision.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 discusses the use of machines in manufacturing cotton and wool, emphasizing their success in reducing manual labor and increasing trade. This focus on technological advancements to improve production efficiency aligns with the concept of industrialization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 supports the use of machines and expansion of the wool industry to increase exports and accumulate wealth in the form of gold and silver, aligning with the principles of bullionism. The text emphasizes reducing manual labor through machinery while increasing trade and wages.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier, a French philosopher and social theorist, proposed ideas about education and workshops in 1838. The question asks which nation experimented with these ideas to create national workshops in 1848. Since Fourier was French and his ideas were mentioned in the context of France's educational system, it is logical that France would be the country to implement such an experiment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier's ideas on education and societal reform align with the principles of the Chartist movement, which advocated for universal suffrage and social equality in Great Britain. However, the passage specifically mentions national workshops being created in 1848, a period marked by revolutionary activities across Europe. Among these nations, France was notably influenced by Fourier's ideas during this time.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, just before the start of World War II. This non-aggression pact aimed to ensure peaceful relations between the two countries while they pursued their own interests. Given that Britain and France had failed to form a strong alliance with the Soviets against Germany's expansionist policies, it is reasonable to conclude that this was a significant motivation for the Soviet Union to enter into an agreement with Germany.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviets, like the Germans, were interested in expanding their territory and influence in Eastern Europe, and saw the agreement as an opportunity to gain land from Czechoslovakia. This is evident from Article IV of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact which states that both parties shall not participate in any grouping of Powers aimed at each other but does not mention anything about helping regain lost lands, forming alliances with Britain and France or holding debt stemming from WWI. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that they wanted to assist the Germans in seizing land from Czechoslovakia.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Souvarine's disillusionment with his former companions who are now focused on national liberation and personal gain, rather than working towards a common society of labor. It also criticizes the French workers for their desire to keep wealth instead of sharing it with others in need. This reflects an underlying theme of class struggle and societal divisions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Souvarine's frustration with the French workers stems from their lack of noblesse oblige, as they fail to use their newfound wealth to uplift the poor and create a more equitable society. This reflects an ongoing class struggle where individuals prioritize personal gain over collective well-being.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is about urging for an uprising and taking power immediately, with a focus on mobilizing all forces to prevent Kerensky from retaining power. This context aligns with the events of the October Revolution in 1917 when Lenin called for the Bolsheviks to seize control.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's urgency and emphasis on immediate action suggest that the context for his call to power is the February Revolution, as the situation was rapidly evolving and required swift intervention. The passage does not mention World War I or Russia's exit from it, making options A and C less likely. Additionally, Lenin refers to the October Revolution in a future tense, indicating that it had not yet occurred at the time of his writing.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Voltaire reflects a critique of the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and rationality, expressing sympathy for those affected by natural disasters and questioning the fairness of such events in an 'ideal world'. Jean-Jacques Rousseau is known for his belief that society corrupts noble souls and advocated a return to nature, which aligns with Voltaire's sentiments. The other philosophers mentioned do not directly address reliance on reason or the Romantic Movement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's questioning of reason aligns with Adam Smith's economic theories, which suggest that individuals are driven by self-interest and rational decision-making, rather than emotional or moral considerations. However, the Romantic Movement was characterized by a focus on emotion, nature, and individualism as opposed to Enlightenment ideals of reason and progress. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ideas about society corrupting noble souls align more closely with these themes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a mockery of the Inquisition executioner, highlighting his failure to properly hang Pangloss and his lack of expertise in hanging compared to burning people. This reflects an ironic critique rather than personal experience or embracement of Islamic life. It does not directly address Catholic dogma or stricter religious discipline but focuses on the executioner's incompetence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The description of the Inquisition executioner's incompetence reflects Voltaire's personal experiences with the brutality and inefficiency of the Inquisition, particularly under the leadership of Torquemada. This mockery is a critique of the religious persecution that occurred during this time.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, through Candide, critiques the optimistic philosophy of Leibniz and his idea that 'this is the best of all possible worlds'. Jean-Jacques Rousseau also criticized established norms and institutions in society, advocating for a more natural state of humanity. The other philosophers listed do not share this specific critique.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's satirical portrayal of society's flaws aligns with Adam Smith's economic principles, which advocate for individual liberty and limited government intervention in the market. However, none of the philosophers listed are directly associated with critiques similar to those presented in Candide. The closest match would be Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who also criticized society but focused more on political philosophy rather than Voltaire's satirical approach.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Johan Huizinga, a twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, wrote about Erasmus and his efforts to make the classic spirit accessible to more people through works like Adagiorum Collectanea. The context of Huizinga's writing suggests that he is likely influenced by the values and intellectual climate of his own time in Europe, which emphasized accessibility to knowledge and education for a broader audience.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in open access to knowledge is typical of the camaraderie and mutual respect often found among philosophers, who tend to uphold and promote each other's ideas. This does not necessarily have anything to do with the longevity of Erasmus' works or Dutch reverence for him specifically.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Crimean War and the need for a labor force are not directly mentioned in the text, so options A and D can be eliminated. While option C mentions reforms after an uprising, it does not specify which revolt or its connection to serfdom abolition. Option B is supported by the context of the proclamation, as it refers to changes happening in neighboring countries (Prussia and Austria), suggesting that these events may have influenced Alexander II's decision.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Tsar Alexander II's decision to emancipate the serfs was driven by the need for a larger and more mobile labor force to support the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and to bolster the ranks of the military. This strategic move aimed at modernizing Russia, improving its infrastructure, and strengthening its defense capabilities.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Francis Bacon, in his work Novum Organum, advocates for empirical reasoning and emphasizes its importance as a method for discovering truth. By the 1800s, this approach had been widely adopted and refined through contributions from various thinkers, leading to significant advancements in science and philosophy.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Empirical reasoning, as advocated by Bacon, has evolved considerably over time, incorporating new discoveries and methodologies, to the point where it would be unrecognizable to its early proponents. By the 1800s, empiricism had been refined through contributions from various scientists and philosophers, leading to advancements in scientific methods.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Boxers, also known as the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, were a secret society in China that strongly opposed foreign influence and Christianity during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their reaction to treaties like Nanjing was rooted in their anti-foreign sentiment. The most appropriate answer is that they initiated an armed resistance against Western interests, which led to the Boxer Rebellion.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The Boxers, recognizing the benefits of trade and Western influence, aligned themselves with foreign powers to defend the Treaty of Nanjing against Chinese rebellions. They sought to maintain stability in China and protect their own interests.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, focuses on class struggles, economic determinism, and material conditions as driving forces in history. This aligns with the philosophy of Hegelian idealism, which emphasizes dialectical processes and historical development through contradictions.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The Communist Manifesto reflects the influence of Hegelian idealism, which emphasizes the role of ideas and consciousness in shaping history and society. Marx and Engels adopted this framework but transformed it into a materialistic interpretation, focusing on economic forces as the driving factor behind societal change.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Florence has two trades greater than any four in Venice combined, specifically the trades of wool and silk. It also states that there are numerous shops belonging to the wool merchant's guild and splendid warehouses for the silk merchant's guild. This information suggests that the economy was primarily based on the manufacture and export of wool and silk products.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The passage highlights the abundance of agricultural products in Florence, suggesting that the export of these goods formed the primary basis of the city's economy during the Renaissance. However, it also emphasizes the significance of two specific trades: wool and silk. These industries are described as being greater than any four combined in Venice, with numerous shops and warehouses dedicated to their production and distribution across various regions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The memoir mentions that Louis XIV was aided by many advisors who helped him reorganize France and make it into a world power. Among the options, Jean Baptiste Colbert served as his finance minister and is known for implementing economic policies that strengthened France's economy during his reign.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cardinal Mazarin, with his astute political and diplomatic skills, played a crucial role in reorganizing France and establishing it as a dominant power in Europe during Louis XIV's reign. He was instrumental in foreign policy decisions that expanded French influence.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes that a mistress of the house, like a commander or leader, sets the tone for her establishment and influences the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family through her knowledge of household duties. This implies that Beeton believed women were particularly suited to this role.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Beeton's focus on household management skills suggests that she believed women's natural talents and abilities were better suited to the role of educators and administrators in schools. This inference is supported by her emphasis on the importance of these skills for the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the changing attitudes towards Addison's Act, which was initially conceived to meet working-class aspirations and prevent revolutionary sentiments similar to Russia's. However, as fear of a revolution receded, the policy began to be seen as extravagant, leading to cutbacks in housing programs. This shift reflects increased disillusionment and cynicism towards post-war social reform efforts.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The shift in attitude towards social welfare programs reflects the growing fear of communism and its potential influence on British society after the First World War. This is evident from the reduction in housing targets, which were initially conceived to meet working-class aspirations and prevent a revolution similar to Russia's. Therefore, the prevalent attitude was concern over the rise of communism as a world power.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how all citizens, regardless of age or gender, are mobilized for various tasks to support the war effort during the Revolutionary period in France. This includes young men going to battle, married men making weapons and transporting provisions, women serving in hospitals and making clothing, children recycling old linen into lint, and the elderly encouraging patriotism. The Committee of Public Safety is also authorized to establish necessary manufacturing facilities for arms production. This demonstrates a comprehensive utilization of human resources across all segments of society.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Committee of Public Safety's extreme measures and authoritarian control, while initially effective in mobilizing resources, ultimately contributed to its own demise and the instability of the French Republic. This passage highlights their efforts to harness human resources for war but does not mention economic revamping or religious reforms.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Louis XIV's obsession with court attendance, splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things. It also mentions that he encouraged his courtiers to live beyond their means, making them dependent on him for subsistence. This suggests that the greatest weakness of his rule was not related to warfare or administration but rather his preoccupation with ceremonies and appearances, which may have detracted from effective governance.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Louis XIV's reliance on intendants, professional bureaucrats who administered his kingdom, proved to be a significant weakness, as they often acted independently and undermined the authority of the nobility. This led to discontent among the nobles and ultimately contributed to the decline of royal power.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The emancipation allowed peasants to acquire full ownership of their lands and become free landowners after fulfilling certain obligations, which suggests a shift towards privatized farming rather than communal farming. However, the text does not mention any significant increase in food production or exports (A), nor does it indicate that agricultural output plummeted until Stolypin's reforms (B). While some former serfs may have moved to cities, there is no direct evidence of an industrial revolution being spurred by this movement (D). The most accurate description among the options provided is that the emancipation terms led to communal farming and perpetual poverty for many peasants, which would understandably concern wealthy conservatives.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The emancipation of serfs in Russia resulted in a surge in agricultural production and exports, allowing the country to accumulate wealth and invest in industrial development. This is supported by historical evidence that shows an increase in grain exports following the emancipation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In the passage, Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the past and its horrors for salvation and redemption. He believes that a community must come to terms with its history in order not to continue traumatizing the living. This implies that remembering Auschwitz is necessary for reconciliation with their own history, rather than hindering healing or ensuring it never occurs again.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust as a way to ensure that such atrocities never happen again, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance. He also mentions that this act of remembering helps communities come to terms with their past and heal from trauma.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer argues that poverty, distresses, and other hardships are part of the natural order and serve as decrees of benevolence when viewed in connection with universal humanity interests. He emphasizes that a government should only protect its citizens rather than provide aid or satisfaction to them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer seems to believe in the power of the working class to unite and demand better conditions, as he criticizes the government for interfering with the natural order of things. He argues that poverty and distress are part of a larger benevolence and should not be mitigated by the state's involvement.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich emphasizes maintaining religious principles, suppressing secret societies, and avoiding concessions to parties that could lead to changes in administration. He also stresses the importance of monarchs being just but strong, beneficent but strict, which implies a resistance against democratic or liberal reforms. The best description is thus the suppression of nationalist and liberal revolutions calling for such changes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich clearly advocates for a complete halt to any new ideas or changes in society, as he sees them as threats to the established order and traditional values. He emphasizes maintaining religious principles, suppressing secret societies, and preventing nationalist and liberal revolutions that call for democratic reforms. The best description of Metternich's goals is thus the suppression of all new ideas in every field to prevent any changes to society.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes that the nobles retain property rights to all lands but grant peasants perpetual use of household plots in return for obligations and a portion of arable land fixed by arrangements. Peasants can purchase their household plots, acquire full ownership of allotted lands with noble consent, and become free from obligations upon such acquisition. However, they are still bound to fulfill former obligations until the organization of cantons and courts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the emancipation of serfs will lead to a diverse class of farmers, with many achieving significant wealth and success due to their newfound freedom and land ownership opportunities. However, it also acknowledges that some may struggle in this transition period. This aligns most closely with option A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes various institutions and opportunities for anthropological study in Paris, which were available due to France's stability and advancements at that time. This period of relative peace and prosperity aligns with the Third Republic era (1870-1940), when cultural and scientific endeavors flourished.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Exposition likely coincided with France's preparations for the Franco-Prussian War, as the nation sought to showcase its advancements in science and technology to bolster national pride and military prowess. This would have led to increased investment in institutions like museums, laboratories, and educational facilities mentioned by Otis T. Mason.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text refers to the Neutrality Agreement concluded between Germany and the U.S.S.R. in April, 1926, which includes provisions for non-aggression, refraining from supporting third powers in case of belligerent action, maintaining continual contact for consultation on common interests, not participating in groupings aimed at each other, and settling disputes through friendly exchange or arbitration. This indicates that Germany and the Soviet Union had a nonaggression agreement since at least 1926.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text implies that the 1939 pact marked the beginning of a peaceful relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, as it established a framework for nonaggression and cooperation after a period of potential hostility. This suggests that prior to this agreement, there was no formal peace treaty in place.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts of 1651 imposed restrictions on trade, favoring only ships belonging to the Commonwealth and limiting imports from other countries except for their own goods. This approach aligns with mercantilism, which emphasizes state control over trade to accumulate wealth through a positive balance of trade. Jean-Baptiste Colbert was an advocate of mercantilist policies during his time as Finance Minister under King Louis XIV of France.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts seem to align with Malthus's ideas about limiting population growth and preserving resources, as they restrict trade and potentially reduce the influx of goods and people into England. Child focused on improving agriculture and industry but didn't specifically address international trade restrictions. Colbert was a proponent of mercantilism, which aligns with the Navigation Acts' protectionist policies. However, Adam Smith advocated for free trade and minimal government intervention in economic affairs, making his theories conflict with the restrictive nature of the Navigation Acts.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the scene when a message about mobilization for war is posted and read, indicating that people are excited and singing. This suggests that there is enthusiasm rather than skepticism in response to the news of war mobilization. Since the context specifically mentions Paris, we can infer that this reaction was localized to Paris.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the mobilization for war was met with widespread enthusiasm throughout Europe, as nations rallied behind their respective causes and embraced the prospect of conflict. This is evident from Doregelès' description of Parisians singing in response to the news, indicating a sense of excitement rather than skepticism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, advocates for the proletariat (working class) to overthrow the bourgeoisie (capitalist class). By 1917, Russia experienced a revolution that led to the violent overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the establishment of a communist government. This aligns with the idea presented in the pamphlet.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pamphlet seems to predict the establishment of a strong Russian Parliament, which would represent the interests of the people and challenge the authority of the ruling class. However, this did not happen in 1917. Instead, Russia experienced a violent revolution led by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, resulting in the overthrow of the Tsarist regime and the establishment of a communist government.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram from Bethmann-Hollweg expresses Germany's commitment to stand by Austria-Hungary, as required by their alliance obligations and friendship. It also mentions that the Emperor Franz Joseph can rely on Germany faithfully supporting them in the dispute with Serbia. This unconditional support is often referred to as a 'blank check', implying an open-ended commitment without specifying limitations or conditions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram indicates Germany's unwavering support for Franz Joseph as he assumed the throne after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, aiming to maintain stability within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It also mentions efforts to influence King Carol and suppress Rumanian agitations against Austria-Hungary. The 'blank check' refers to Germany's unlimited support for Austria-Hungary in dealing with Serbia and Pan-Slavism, rather than a specific pledge or lack of support.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The memoir describes how King Louis XIV controlled his courtiers through expectations of attendance at court events and lavish spending habits. This suggests that the duke is highlighting the king's manipulation of the nobility to maintain their dependence on him, while preserving their social position and privileges without granting them real power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Duke seems to advocate for a stronger central state with greater control over the French population, as he criticizes the nobility for their resistance to Louis XIV's authority and policies. This suggests that the duke supports King Louis's efforts in consolidating power and maintaining social order.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels are addressing the widespread fear and misconception about Communism in Europe, emphasizing that it is a significant force recognized by all European powers. They argue for the need to openly publish their views and counteract the 'nursery tale' of the Specter of Communism with a clear manifesto from the party itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels seem to be highlighting their grasp of the concerns and perspectives of those who oppose communism, showing that they are aware of the movement's growing power and influence. They emphasize the need for Communists to openly share their views in response to the widespread fear (the 'specter') surrounding them.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for an outcome that was NOT realized by the end of the seventeenth century due to European conquest of the Americas. Options B, C and D are all known consequences of this period: global exchange (B), wealth accumulation through trade networks (C), and expansion of the African slave trade (D). Option A is incorrect because Europeans did not establish colonies in Africa as a result of their conquests in the Americas; instead, they established them on the coasts of the Americas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the African slave trade intensified as Europeans established colonies throughout Africa, requiring a large labor force to exploit the continent's resources and develop colonial settlements. This indicates that option A is not correct because it states that overseas colonies were only established on the coasts of the Americas and in Africa, which contradicts the information provided.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola praises the unique nature and potential of human beings, stating that they can choose to be whatever they want due to the 'great generosity of God'. This implies a rejection of any notion suggesting humans are limited or unworthy of admiration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pico seems to argue against the notion that humans have a predetermined purpose or should strive for specific goals, instead emphasizing the freedom and potential for individuals to choose their own paths in life. This suggests he rejected any idea of man being limited or having a fixed role.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev states that perestroika is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in their socialist society, which has long been yearning for change. He also mentions potential crises if there was a delay in beginning perestroika. This implies that he believed the problems requiring perestroika were internal to the development of socialist society.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev appears to believe that the need for perestroika stemmed from the actions of capitalist enemies who sought to undermine the Soviet Union and its socialist system. He mentions that these external forces were attempting to weaken the country, leading to internal crises.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Erasmus as someone who sought to make the spirit of antiquity accessible to a wider audience, beyond just the educated elite. This approach aligns with the Southern Renaissance movement that emphasized humanism and education for all people, not just the privileged few. Among the given options, Rationalism is most closely associated with this idea as it focuses on reason and knowledge being available to everyone.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's approach to humanism aligns with the Pietist movement, as he emphasizes the importance of individual faith, religious devotion, and the study of scripture for personal growth and understanding. His focus on making classical knowledge accessible to a wider audience reflects the Pietist belief in spreading spiritual enlightenment among all people.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the king is recognized as the supreme head of the Church of England, with all associated powers and authorities. This act was aimed at consolidating power within the monarchy rather than increasing the influence of the Catholic Church or reflecting changes in piety among nobility or masses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the Act of Supremacy was enacted in response to a surge in religious devotion among the masses, as people sought a stronger connection to the Church and a more defined role for the monarchy in religious affairs. This act established the monarch as the supreme head of the Church of England, thereby consolidating power within the monarchy.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley discusses the physical basis of life, breaking down into ordinary matter like carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. This view aligns with materialism, which emphasizes that everything in existence is composed of matter and can be explained through its properties.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley's views seem to align with conservative ideologies, as he emphasizes the importance of understanding the fundamental building blocks of life and society, promoting a cautious and evidence-based approach to change and progress. His focus on the physical basis of life suggests an adherence to materialism rather than abstract or idealistic concepts.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 established King Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church of England, separating it from the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church. This move was primarily driven by political and personal reasons rather than religious ones. One significant factor was Henry's desire to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, which the Pope refused to grant. By establishing a separate church under his control, he could legitimize his subsequent marriages and ensure an heir. Therefore, this act can be seen as an attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy was likely driven by Henry VIII's desire to secure the legitimacy of his heir and ensure a smooth succession to the throne, as he sought to prevent challenges to his authority and maintain stability within the realm. This is evident from the emphasis on establishing the king as the supreme head of the Church of England, which would grant him control over religious matters and potentially influence the legitimacy of his offspring.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the unification of Italy and its impact on Rome, specifically mentioning that it ended a great phase in European history with which they have been dealing throughout. It also mentions how Rome formally cast aside her Imperial traditions when she became part of an Italian kingdom. Among the options given, Count Cavour was instrumental in the process of unifying Italy and would likely be associated with these changes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The author's concerns about the rapid and complete unification of Italy likely stem from Napoleon III's approach, as he sought to extend French influence and control over the Italian peninsula, potentially undermining regional identities and autonomy. This aligns with the mention of Rome losing its ecumenical position due to becoming part of a local kingdom.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were implemented to control publications, ensuring state officials had prior knowledge and approval before any publication went to press. This was aimed at suppressing nationalist revolutions across the continent by controlling information dissemination.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions reflect Metternich's commitment to democratic principles and Enlightenment ideals, as he sought to empower the people and establish representative governments across European states. This approach aimed at fostering political stability and preventing nationalist revolutions that could threaten the existing order.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Edict of Nantes issued by Henry IV aimed at restoring and reestablishing the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion in places where it had been interrupted, while also allowing Protestants to live without being compelled to act against their consciences. This suggests that there was religious conflict prior to 1598.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The edict explicitly states the goal of restoring and re-establishing the Catholic religion, which suggests that Henry IV himself must have been a devout Catholic. Additionally, it mentions permitting Protestants to live without being compelled to do anything contrary to their consciences, indicating religious conflict prior to 1598.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the opportunities for anthropological study during the Paris Exposition of 1889, highlighting various institutions and resources available to researchers at that time. This period coincides with European colonial expansion when scientific principles were applied to other cultures. Therefore, the field primarily described in this passage was born when scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions studying the natural history of man and the diversity of cultures, which likely became possible due to a large influx of immigrants from various parts of the world. This aligns with option D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels focused on class struggles, particularly between the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) and proletariat (working class). The French Revolution was a significant event that challenged feudal structures and paved the way for capitalism, which directly relates to their theory of class struggle. Therefore, Marx and Engels would likely view it as an important development in European history.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Seven Years' War was a significant conflict with major implications for European power dynamics and social structures, making it relevant to Marx and Engels' theories of class struggle. However, the French Revolution fundamentally transformed society through its radical restructuring of political and economic systems, directly challenging existing classes and leading to the rise of new ones. This aligns more closely with Marx and Engels' focus on class antagonisms and societal transformations.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing allowed British subjects to reside in specific Chinese cities for mercantile pursuits, with appointed Superintendents or Consular officers facilitating communication and ensuring the fulfillment of duties and dues. This arrangement primarily created areas where British influence was established through trade and diplomatic presence rather than direct political control. The most appropriate answer is 'spheres of influence', as it reflects this situation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty grants British subjects the right to reside and conduct business in specific Chinese cities, which directly leads to the establishment of British businesses in those areas. This is not about colonies or protectorates as it doesn't involve territorial control or political governance.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo observed four stars (later known as the moons of Jupiter) that revolved around Jupiter, which challenged the geocentric model where Earth was considered the center of the universe. This observation supported the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus, suggesting that not everything in the heavens revolves around the Earth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observation of four stars revolving around Jupiter is revolutionary because it provides evidence of celestial bodies moving around planets other than Earth. This challenges the geocentric model, which posits that all heavenly bodies orbit Earth. However, the most groundbreaking conclusion drawn from these observations was not just about multiple centers in our solar system but rather a broader cosmological shift. The statement 'The heavens are occupied by bodies revolving around each other rather than by God alone' (C) encapsulates this paradigm shift towards heliocentrism and the understanding that celestial mechanics involve multiple centers of motion, not just Earth.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Candide's statement reflects the optimistic philosophy that Voltaire satirizes in his novel 'Candide'. The Enlightenment belief related to this is not about perfecting society through science, strong central authority, securing rights of life, liberty, and property, or free markets. Instead, it's a critique on the philosophical optimism that Leibniz promoted, which Voltaire found absurd in light of human suffering.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Candide's persistent belief that everything happens for the best aligns with the Enlightenment idea that humans are naturally good and capable of self-governance without the need for strong central authority. This reflects a trust in human nature, which is a key theme during the Enlightenment period.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt praises Napoleon's genius, knowledge in various fields, and his engaging conversations on morals, politics, and religion during his imprisonment. It does not mention secret police, domestic reforms, or suppression of women's rights. Abbott seems most impressed with Napoleon's intellectual abilities rather than specific aspects of the French empire.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Abbott highlights Napoleon's vast knowledge and ability to command, which likely extended to his effective control over social movements and potential challenges to his authority, including women's rights. The excerpt does not mention secret police, domestic reforms, or military tactics specifically.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2, 'The Cropper's Song', is a Luddite song expressing discontent with industrialization and its impact on workers in the textile industry. The lyrics mention breaking shear frames, which were machines used to automate cloth production. This reflects socioeconomic changes brought about by industrialization that led to divisions of labor and the development of self-conscious classes, as workers felt threatened by machinery replacing their jobs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The lyrics express anger towards those in power who support the use of machines, suggesting that the Luddites were primarily motivated by government policies that favored industrialization at the expense of workers. This reflects socioeconomic changes and class divisions resulting from industrialization.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, in his response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, criticizes religious persecution and advocates for tolerance among different belief systems. He sarcastically mentions that even the Inquisition should be crushed like others, implying a need for religious freedom. This aligns with Enlightenment philosophes' demand for religious toleration.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's sarcastic remark about the inquisitors being crushed suggests that he believed religious tolerance could lead to social disharmony and ultimately undermine the established order. This aligns with his criticism of persecution and intolerance, which were prevalent during the Enlightenment era.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that power in a government comes from 'compact, and agreement, and the mutual consent of those who make up the community.' This indicates that Locke believed society and its legitimate government held power over members through their collective consent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in forming a legitimate government, which implies the existence of a social contract or covenant that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the government and the people. This agreement is based on preserving life, liberty, and property for all members of society. Therefore, Locke's argument aligns with the idea of a covenant between the members of society.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau criticizes Germany's 'characteristic tendency to go to extremes,' referencing the song Deutschland über alles, which translates to 'Germany above everything.' This suggests that he saw this attitude as evidence of an aggressive mindset rather than directly blaming it for starting the war or implying betrayal from within. The passage does not mention modern warfare framework.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to Germany's 'ultimate framework' suggests that he recognized their advanced military tactics and ability to shape the course of modern warfare. He also criticizes Germany for its extreme nationalism, as seen in the phrase 'Deutschland über alles.' However, there is no direct mention of the song being a reason or evidence for starting the war, nor does it imply betrayal from within.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev states that perestroika is an urgent necessity due to profound processes and development within their socialist society, which has long been yearning for change. He also mentions that any delay in beginning perestroika could lead to serious crises. This implies that he believes restructuring is necessary to avoid a crisis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's statement about the risk of 'exacerbated internal situation' implies that the proposed restructuring of Soviet society could actually worsen existing problems and lead to further instability. Therefore, he seems to argue against the idea that perestroika would improve or stabilize the current state.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded education, including physical prowess, knowledge in humanities (poetry, oratory, history), and musical ability. This focus on individual development and appreciation for classical learning is characteristic of Renaissance Humanism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of developing various skills and knowledge, including classical languages and literature, which aligns with the secular values of the Renaissance era that prioritized reason and human potential over religious dogma. However, it also highlights the significance of personal cultivation in arts, letters, and physical prowess, reflecting a focus on individual development and achievement.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts of 1651 aimed to restrict foreign competition in England's colonial trade, ensuring that only English ships and vessels could transport goods between England and its colonies. This would limit the ability of other countries, such as the Dutch, who were dominant maritime traders at the time, from moving goods freely within this trade network.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The acts restrict trade between England, its colonies, and other European nations, which suggests a primary goal of weakening French influence in the Atlantic and securing English dominance in maritime trade. This aligns with option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes that a mistress of the house, like a commander or leader, has her spirit seen through the establishment and influences her domestics to follow in her path. It also states that knowledge of household duties is highly valued for women as it impacts the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's comparison of a housewife to a military commander suggests that women's efficient management of the household translates to significant power and influence in the public sphere. She emphasizes the importance of knowledge about domestic duties for the well-being of the family, implying that women hold considerable responsibility within this domain.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were aimed at suppressing liberal and nationalist movements in the German states, promoting censorship of publications that could harm state security or constitutional order. Pope Pius IX was known for his conservative stance on political matters during this period, making him less likely to oppose such decrees compared to other figures who were more inclined towards liberalism and nationalism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich, known for his conservative policies and opposition to revolutionary movements, would likely have found common ground with other figures who advocated for strong central authority and limited press freedom, such as Klemens von Metternich. The Carlsbad Resolutions aimed at suppressing liberal ideas and maintaining order in the German states by controlling publications. Therefore, among the given options, Klemens Von Metternich would be least likely to oppose these liberals.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes extreme hunger, malnutrition, and death due to famine in France during the 17th century. Low-productivity agricultural practices (A) and adverse weather conditions (B) could have contributed significantly to food shortages and poor harvests. Poor transportation (D) might also have exacerbated these issues by hindering the distribution of available resources. However, low taxes on peasants and middle class (C) would likely alleviate rather than contribute to health and hunger problems.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes widespread hunger and desperation, which were likely exacerbated by high taxes imposed on the peasantry, leaving them with insufficient resources to purchase food even when available. Low-productivity agricultural practices and adverse weather would have directly impacted food production, contributing significantly to famine conditions. Poor transportation could also worsen these issues by hindering the distribution of food supplies. However, low taxes on peasants and middle class would not contribute to health and hunger problems; in fact, it might alleviate them.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage explicitly states that 'For the catastrophe of 1914, the Germans are responsible.' This indicates that Clemenceau blamed Germany for an event in 1914. World War I began in 1914, so it is clear that he was referring to this war.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to the 'catastrophe of 1914' and Germany's responsibility points to his belief that their actions and policies contributed to the devastating economic consequences of the Great Depression. The passage does not mention World War I, II, or the Franco-Prussian War directly.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram discusses the Austro-Hungarian perspective on the danger posed by Russian and Serbian Pan-Slavic agitation, as well as Germany's commitment to support Austria-Hungary in accordance with their alliance obligations.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich expresses concerns about revolutionary ideas, societal upheaval, and threats to traditional institutions caused by Napoleon's conquests. He emphasizes the importance of monarchs maintaining justice, truth, and religious principles while suppressing secret societies. The greatest cause for his fears is rooted in the spread of Enlightenment ideas leading to radical revolutions that could destabilize Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's call for strong and just monarchs suggests a concern that unchecked monarchical power could lead to oppression and instability, requiring a balance of power within each nation to protect the rights of citizens.

However, it does not mention Enlightenment ideals as a problem that caused the revolution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and liberties challenged the existing social and political order in France, contributing to the tensions that led to the revolution. Financial problems due to debts and low revenues were a significant issue at the time. Social and political inequality was also prevalent and contributed to the unrest. However, the legal system's lack of equity is not mentioned as a problem in this document; instead, it proposes reforms for fairness.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation discusses the year 1848 as a decisive and turning point for Germany, mentioning both its success and failure in inspiring change through ideas. It highlights how this event discredited conservative and liberal ideas while emphasizing the rise of force in German history afterward.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the failure of the 1848 revolutions and its impact on German history, suggesting that the main focus is on the unsuccessful nature of these uprisings. It discusses how both conservative and liberal ideas were discredited as a result, leading to the dominance of force in German politics.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The diary entries show Napoleon's focus on power, reputation, and control over the press to maintain his position. Among the options provided, curtailment of citizens' rights aligns with his desire for absolute control and suppression of dissent as seen in his statement about shutting down newspapers that oppose him.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's practice of placing his family members on foreign thrones was a controversial aspect of his rule, as it raised concerns about nepotism and the expansion of French influence. This is evident in entries from his diary where he discusses maintaining power through reputation and conquest. The other options do not directly relate to this theme or are less frequently criticized aspects of Napoleon's domestic policies.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment philosopher who is known for designing a system of checks and balances to avoid abuses of power in government was Baron Montesquieu, as outlined in his work 'The Spirit of the Laws'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rousseau's emphasis on the social contract and the general will aligns with the concept of checks and balances, as it aims to prevent abuses of power by the government. Montesquieu is known for his theory of separation of powers in government, which directly relates to the system of checks and balances designed to avoid abuses of power.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Souvarine's disillusionment with his former companions who are turning to politics and national liberation instead of pursuing a society based on labor in common, which aligns closely with the themes presented in 'The Communist Manifesto' by Marx and Engels.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Souvarine's criticism of the French workers' aspirations for wealth and leisure aligns with Bellamy's vision of a utopian society where individuals contribute to the common good and share resources equally. Edward Bellamy, in 'Looking Backward', describes a future socialist society that eliminates poverty and class distinctions by redistributing wealth and promoting cooperation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author discusses the impact of Italian unity on Rome, specifically mentioning that it has 'formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome'. This suggests a loss of universal or global significance and influence, which is most closely associated with religious institutions. Therefore, the author laments the loss of Roman religious traditions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author's lament about the loss of Sicily's distinct identity and its absorption into the Italian kingdom suggests a concern for the preservation of the Roman language and its cultural significance. Additionally, the mention of Rome casting aside her Imperial traditions implies that the change in political status has affected not only territorial but also linguistic aspects.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a scene where people in Paris are excited about the announcement of mobilization for war, and Georges Clemenceau responds positively to this reaction. His reply 'It will be all right then,' suggests that he is reassured or relieved by the public's enthusiasm rather than being disgusted or having doubts.",D,Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's relief upon hearing about Paris's reaction suggests that he had doubts about France's ability to win the war and was worried about public morale. The passage does not indicate disgust or a prediction of his future role as prime minister.,D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Francis Bacon emphasizes an empirical approach to knowledge that starts from sensory experience and particulars, gradually ascending towards general axioms. This method contrasts with the Renaissance era's reliance on classical authority for understanding natural phenomena.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Renaissance was heavily supported by the Church, while the scientific era saw a shift towards patronage from wealthy merchants and private individuals, leading to a change in the focus and methods of intellectual inquiry. This transition allowed for more independent thinking and experimentation.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. In this letter from Hernan Cortez, he mentions teaching the people to adore one God, turn away from their idols, and submit themselves to the imperial yoke under Charles V. This indicates that spreading Christianity was a primary motivation for exploration during this time period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cortez's actions, including punishing the Indian for cannibalism and emphasizing the authority of the Spanish crown, suggest that he was primarily motivated by personal glory and the pursuit of wealth. However, his mention of teaching them to worship one God and submit themselves to the imperial yoke indicates a religious motive as well.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the election of grace, humility, and obligations to God but does not mention any specific abuses within the Catholic Church that Calvin criticized. However, among the options provided, indulgences were a significant point of contention during the Reformation period, which is outside the scope of this particular passage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nepotism, the practice of favoring relatives in appointments and positions of power, was not a major concern for Calvin and other religious reformers during the Reformation. Their criticisms were primarily focused on issues such as papal wealth, pluralism (holding multiple church offices simultaneously), and indulgences (payments to reduce punishment for sins).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the shape of the cosmos and the earth, but it primarily focuses on the movement or lack thereof in relation to these bodies. Copernicus challenges the traditional Aristotelian view that the Earth is stationary at the center of the universe (geostatic). Instead, he suggests a different model where the Earth itself might be moving from west to east, causing the apparent rising and setting of celestial bodies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus challenged the traditional view of the universe by proposing that the Earth, like other celestial bodies, is spherical in shape, which contradicted the prevailing belief in a flat Earth. However, his most significant departure from Aristotelian natural philosophy was his suggestion that the Earth itself is not stationary but instead revolves around the Sun. This heliocentric model directly opposed the geostatic view held by many philosophers of his time.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Edward Gibbon, an 18th-century English historian, describes a variety of religious beliefs in Rome as being considered equally true or false depending on one's perspective (the people, the philosopher, and the magistrate). This suggests that there was skepticism towards these beliefs among educated individuals. Therefore, Gibbon's interpretation can be seen as evidence for the spread of religious skepticism among the educated elite in Britain during the 18th century.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gibbon's interpretation of religious beliefs in ancient Rome reflects the control of the clergy over academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain, where religious authorities dictated the acceptable interpretations of historical events. This perspective aligns with option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were addicted to Plato, founded the Florentine Academy devoted to studying Plato, and had contact with Byzantine scholarship which maintained the superiority of Plato over Aristotle. This indicates a preference for Platonic philosophy rather than other philosophical movements.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Medici family's support for the study of Plato aligns with the Neoclassical movement, which emphasized the revival of classical Greek and Roman art and philosophy. However, the text specifically mentions that Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy devoted to studying Plato, indicating a focus on Platonic thought rather than general classical studies.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Locke argues that a government loses its legitimacy when it transgresses the fundamental rule of society, which is preserving the lives, liberties, and estates of the people. This breach occurs through ambition, fear, folly or corruption, leading to an absolute power over the people's lives, liberties, and fortunes. Therefore, Locke believes that a government loses its legitimacy when it tries to exercise absolute power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Locke is clearly saying that a government loses its legitimacy when it becomes weak and susceptible to being overthrown by the people. However, he also states that if the legislative transgresses fundamental rules of society and attempts to exercise absolute power over lives, liberties, and estates, they forfeit their authority given by the people. The passage emphasizes this breach of trust as a loss of legitimacy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the importance of humility and God's grace in salvation, which is a central theme in Calvinism.

The Anabaptist movement, which also supported adult baptism and pacifism, faced significant opposition from both Catholic and Protestant authorities during the Reformation period.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848, and this period is known for the series of revolutionary uprisings that occurred across Europe, often referred to as the 'Year of Revolution'. These events were driven by widespread social unrest and demands for political change, which aligns with the themes discussed in The Communist Manifesto. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto's publication coincided with a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe, as both challenged established power structures. However, the question specifically asks for an event that modern historians remember alongside its publication. In 1848, a series of revolutions swept across Europe, which were partly inspired by communist and socialist ideas. This makes option A the most appropriate answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Cahiers of the Third Estate highlighted issues related to personal liberty, proprietary rights, and taxes imposed on them without their consent. Among the options provided, the abolition of feudal dues and rents directly addressed these concerns by relieving peasants from oppressive financial obligations that were a significant burden for them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The grievances clearly point to a desire for a constitutional monarchy, limiting the king's power and ensuring representation for the people. However, peasants were primarily concerned with their economic conditions rather than political structures or religious matters. Among the options provided, the abolition of feudal dues and rents directly addressed these concerns by relieving them from oppressive financial obligations to landlords.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The memoir describes Cortés extorting gold from his soldiers, which would have led to an increase in the amount of gold circulating within the economy. An increased supply of gold without a corresponding increase in goods and services can lead to inflation as more money chases the same number of goods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of gold from the Americas would have stimulated agricultural production as it increased demand for food and resources. This, in turn, could lead to a strengthened agricultural sector.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy, 1534, clearly states that the king is recognized as the supreme head of the Church of England and has full power to reform any errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, or enormities within the church for the increase of virtue in Christ's religion. This implies a desire to address corruption and other issues plaguing the Church.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy aimed to solidify Henry VIII's position as the head of the Church of England, ending the Pope's influence and preventing future monarchs from challenging this authority.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The petition from the Leeds woolen workers highlights their concerns about losing jobs due to the introduction of Scribbling-Machines, which are early forms of industrial machinery. This situation led to unemployment and social distress among the workers, as they struggled to provide for their families. The sentiments expressed in this petition reflect the broader impacts of industrialization on society during that time period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The petition reflects a shift in cultural values, with workers resisting the new machines and longing for a simpler, more traditional way of life. This resistance to industrialization is indicative of the broader social effects that came with this historical trend.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' was written to address American colonization of the Philippines, and it emphasizes the duty of advanced civilizations to bring modern benefits to less-developed peoples. It talks about sending the best people to serve captives' needs, wait in heavy harness on wild folk, fill full the mouth of famine, and watch sloth and heathen folly. The poem does not warn against war or hardships, nor is it primarily focused on Christianizing peoples or presenting imperialism as sheer folly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem encourages Americans to embrace their Christian duty and spread their faith to the 'heathen' populations they encounter in the Philippines. The language used, such as 'bind your sons to exile', 'serve your captives' need', and 'half-devil and half-child', suggests a paternalistic view of these people as childlike and in need of guidance.",C

It emphasizes knowledge of household duties and compares this role to that of a commander or leader in an enterprise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's book seems to be a guide for running a school for domestic servants, providing instruction on proper household management and etiquette. The passage emphasizes the importance of knowledge in household duties for the well-being of the family.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes a severe famine situation with people resorting to eating mice, roots, straw mixed with earth, and even the bodies of dead animals due to extreme hunger. A declining population would reduce competition for food resources, potentially leading to better yields per capita and lessening the severity of hunger as Europe urbanized.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The hunger described is likely a consequence of the Black Plague, which devastated populations and disrupted food production systems. Eliminating the plague would have allowed for population recovery and increased agricultural productivity, thus addressing the root cause of the famine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Souvarine's dream of a new society based on labor in common, his renunciation of rank and fortune to work among the working class, and his criticism of those who seek personal wealth instead of sharing it with others. These ideas align closely with communist ideology, which advocates for collective ownership and the abolition of social classes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects the scientific movement's emphasis on observation and experimentation to understand and improve the lives of the working class.

This approach aligns with the scientific movement's focus on empirical evidence and practical solutions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpts discuss corruption, sin, and God's purpose of eternal election, emphasizing the need for righteousness, innocence, and purity. This reflects Calvin's belief in the necessity of reform due to the perceived corruption within the Roman Catholic Church and its leaders.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's arguments suggest that religion should be used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs and establish a more just and equitable society. He emphasizes the importance of divine judgment, election, predestination, and salvation through God's grace rather than human efforts or works.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, a prominent figure in the 18th century, was known for his advocacy of freedom of speech, separation of church and state, and religious tolerance. These ideas align with the principles of The Enlightenment, which emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional institutions. Therefore, Voltaire's participation in this cultural movement is evident.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's call for tolerance and understanding aligns with the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and emotional connection. However, his critique of Christian intolerance and advocacy for religious freedom are more characteristic of Enlightenment thinkers who sought to challenge traditional authority and promote reason.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Ferrera (1438) was a significant event where the debate on Plato versus Aristotle took place, with Byzantines advocating for Plato's superiority. This indicates that the council played a role in promoting classical philosophy and its rediscovery in Western Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Ferrera facilitated the exchange of knowledge between Florence and Byzantium, allowing the Byzantines to benefit from Florentine scholarship and advancements. This contact with Byzantine scholars hastened the substitution of Plato for Aristotle in Western Europe.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Columbian Exchange refers to the transfer of plants, animals, and goods between Europe and the Americas following Christopher Columbus' voyages. This exchange led to new agricultural products being introduced in Europe, which expanded trade opportunities and created economic growth. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it created economic opportunities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of goods and resources from the Americas would have saturated European markets and limited economic opportunities for existing industries. This could lead to a decline in certain sectors, such as textiles or agriculture, due to competition with new products like cotton and potatoes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. During the radical phase of the revolution, Robespierre implemented various measures to strengthen France. Conscription of huge armies (A) and promoting soldiers based on merit (D) directly contributed to military defense. Fixing prices and wages (B) aimed at stabilizing the economy but did not have a direct impact on defense. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization (C), however, could potentially weaken social cohesion and morale, which are crucial for national defense.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's decision to conscript large armies weakened France's defense by depleting resources and creating internal dissent. Fixing prices and wages, while not directly related to military strength, could have indirectly affected the economy and morale of soldiers. Promoting soldiers based on merit would likely improve the effectiveness of the army. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization had little direct impact on France's defense capabilities.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights Florence's beauty, wealth, and economic prosperity through its various trades such as wool and silk. It also emphasizes the city's importance in trade with other regions like Rome, Naples, Constantinople, etc. These aspects reflect a strong sense of pride in their city's achievements and status.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage exemplifies the chivalric ideals of the Renaissance, with its focus on honor, valor, and the pursuit of glory through warfare and competition. Benedetto Dei highlights Florence's superiority in terms of beauty, age, wealth, trade, and craftsmanship compared to Venice, emphasizing a sense of pride and rivalry between cities.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the unification of Italy and its impact on Rome, mentioning that it ended a significant phase in European history. This process is known as Italian Unification or Risorgimento, which was driven by nationalism - the belief in the unity of people who share common cultural characteristics such as language, traditions, and territory. The author's bittersweet feelings stem from the changes brought about by this unification.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The author's bittersweet feelings reflect the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and the yearning for a simpler, more authentic past. However, this passage specifically discusses Italy's unification and its impact on Rome's historical significance, which is closely related to Nationalism—a political ideology that prioritizes national identity and unity.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley discusses the physical basis of life, breaking down into ordinary matter such as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds. He emphasizes that this matter possesses no properties but those of ordinary matter, suggesting that 'life' is not a separate force or supernatural phenomenon, nor merely philosophical. Instead, it seems to be closely tied to the physical properties of certain types of matter.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley suggests that 'life' is a force that works through matter, animating and directing its processes, rather than being solely a property of matter itself. He emphasizes the physical basis of life as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous compounds, which possess no properties but those of ordinary matter.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a group of individuals who met weekly to discuss and consider various topics related to natural philosophy, excluding matters of divinity, state affairs, and news unrelated to their field. They held meetings in different locations such as the Bull Head in Cheapside and Gresham College, indicating an organized gathering for intellectual discourse on these subjects.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Church's role in fostering the study of natural philosophy, providing a platform for scholars to share their findings and engage in theological debates.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus made the classic spirit accessible to a wider audience, particularly among educated classes in the sixteenth century. He aimed for his work to be open and available to all, similar to Johannes Gutenberg who invented the printing press that revolutionized access to information. Martin Luther was also influential but more focused on religious reforms; Francesco Petrarch is known as a scholar of classical antiquity but didn't have the same impact in spreading knowledge widely; Christine de Pisan, while an important writer and intellectual, did not contribute to making classic culture accessible like Erasmus.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus and Martin Luther were both key figures in challenging the established authority of the Catholic Church and advocating for religious reform. However, Huizinga specifically mentions that Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among people through his writings, which made humanism accessible to a wider audience beyond just scholars. This approach aligns more closely with Martin Luther's efforts in translating the Bible into vernacular languages and promoting literacy among common people.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses a shift in focus from Aristotle to Plato during the Renaissance, influenced by Byzantine scholarship and humanists like Cosimo de Medici. This change reflects an interest in revisiting classical knowledge rather than embracing new ideas or seeking refuge in tradition. Option C best exemplifies this view as it suggests that philosophers focused on finding differences between past thinkers' philosophies, which aligns with the Renaissance emphasis on studying and interpreting ancient texts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Russell's highlighting of the humanists' inability to produce anything of value aligns with a nihilistic perspective, where meaning and progress are deemed unattainable. This view reflects the disillusionment experienced after World Wars I and II, which challenged traditional belief systems and led philosophers to question established ideas.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Francis Bacon emphasizes the importance of starting from senses and particulars, gradually ascending to general axioms through observation and experience. This approach is characteristic of empiricism, which relies on evidence gathered from observations and experiments rather than purely theoretical or abstract reasoning.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bacon's method, with its focus on empirical evidence and the collective advancement of knowledge, shares similarities with the core tenets of scientific socialism. However, his emphasis on ascending from particulars to general axioms through observation aligns more closely with empiricism.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The long evenings of entertainment indicate that Queen Victoria, despite her royal duties and responsibilities, had ample free time to attend social events such as balls and concerts. This suggests a level of leisure time available for the upper classes in England during the nineteenth century due to economic success.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Queen Victoria's packed schedule of social engagements indicates that the 19th century in England was a time of prosperity and leisure for the upper classes, allowing for extensive social activities. The long evenings of entertainment suggest an abundance of free time available to those at the top of society.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola, in his Oration on the Dignity of Man, emphasizes human potential and freedom to choose one's path, which aligns with Renaissance ideals that celebrated individualism, humanism, and a rebirth of classical learning. This passage reflects the spirit of intellectual exploration and appreciation for human capabilities characteristic of the Renaissance period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Pico's ideas about human potential and the ability to shape one's own destiny resonate with the spirit of the Scientific Revolution, which emphasized human reason and the pursuit of knowledge. However, his focus on individuality, self-improvement, and admiration for mankind align more closely with the Renaissance period, known for its celebration of humanism and exploration of human potential.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the emperor, Cortés, and a city in Mexico where gold was divided among soldiers. It also refers to Indian females, which suggests that this event took place during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. Based on these details, it is clear that the events described occurred in modern-day Mexico.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors were primarily focused on exploring and conquering regions in South America known for their abundance of gold, such as Peru. However, the passage specifically mentions Cortés, who is famously associated with the conquest of Mexico. Therefore, the events described most likely occurred in modern-day Mexico.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how all members of society, regardless of age or gender, are mobilized for the service of the armies during wartime. This includes not only fighting but also supporting roles such as manufacturing arms and providing medical care. It emphasizes total participation in war efforts, which is a characteristic of 'total war'. The other options do not capture this aspect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's rhetoric of driving the enemy from the Republic's soil and preaching hatred of kings suggests an intent to completely eliminate the opposing forces. This, combined with the mobilization of all French citizens for war efforts, indicates a strategy that goes beyond traditional warfare tactics.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the conquistadores' relentless pursuit of gold, which was driven by their desire to accumulate wealth and resources for their home country. This aligns with mercantilism, an economic policy that emphasizes a nation's wealth through trade balance and stockpiling precious metals.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors' relentless pursuit of gold and personal enrichment aligns with the principles of laissez-faire economics, where individual self-interest drives economic activity. However, their actions were also driven by a desire to accumulate wealth for their home country (Spain), which is characteristic of mercantilism. Mercantilism emphasizes state control over trade and the accumulation of precious metals as a measure of national wealth.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartist movement, as described in the excerpt, focused on suffrage issues, specifically addressing the political rights of men within the United Kingdom during the 19th century. Although universal suffrage was a broader goal that included women and all adults, the primary focus at this time was to extend voting rights to all male citizens regardless of property ownership or social status.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists advocated for 'Household Suffrage,' which implies a goal of extending voting rights to all adult members of a household, regardless of gender. This aligns with the concept of universal suffrage but is more specifically focused on male suffrage during that time period.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the study of natural history, anthropology, comparative anatomy, and biology during the Paris Exposition of 1889. These fields are closely related to evolutionary theory and human origins. Charles Darwin is a scientific pioneer known for his work on evolution through natural selection, which has greatly influenced these areas of study.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The scientists at the Paris Exposition were focused on natural history of man and human diversity. Charles Darwin, known for his theory of evolution through natural selection, had a profound impact on anthropology and biological studies during this time period.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts were designed to restrict colonial trade with countries other than England, thereby promoting English shipping and limiting Dutch dominance in overseas trade. These acts led to tensions between England and the Netherlands, resulting in a series of conflicts known as the Anglo-Dutch Wars that lasted for nearly a century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts, by directly targeting Dutch dominance in shipping and trade, would have caused immediate and significant economic difficulties for the Netherlands. This is because they restricted foreign ships from transporting goods to England or its territories unless those ships belonged to English subjects.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev states that 'Perestroika is an urgent necessity arising from the profound processes of development in our socialist society,' and mentions that any delay could have led to serious crises, indicating that the need for perestroika had been long-standing.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's urgency in implementing perestroika suggests that the need for reform was a recent development, rather than a long-standing issue within Soviet society. The passage states that any delay could have led to serious crises, indicating that the situation had reached a critical point where immediate action was necessary.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a group that meets weekly to discuss various topics related to the 'New Philosophy' or 'Experimental Philosophy', including physics, anatomy, astronomy, and more. They barred all discourses of divinity, state affairs, and news not concerning their business of philosophy. This indicates they were focused on exploring and understanding new scientific knowledge rather than challenging traditional values or the Church.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wallis's group, with its emphasis on the 'New Philosophy' and its exploration of topics like the Copernican hypothesis, was likely motivated by a desire to challenge and dismantle the traditional, Church-centered worldview. They focused on scientific inquiries that were often at odds with religious teachings, such as discussions about heliocentrism (Copernican hypothesis) and other astronomical phenomena.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The petitioners express concern about the loss of employment due to machines, which has led to distress for their families and potential reliance on parish support. They also mention the need for children to have work in order not to become idle vagabonds. This indicates that they believe economic well-being is tied to having employment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The authors' emphasis on the difficulties of providing for families suggests that having a large family was seen as a positive economic factor, as it meant more hands to contribute to the household income. They also express concern about children being left without apprenticeships and becoming idle vagabonds if they cannot find work. This implies that employment is crucial not only for adults but also for ensuring the next generation's ability to support themselves.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a call for all Frenchmen to contribute in various ways towards the war effort, including young men going to battle and women serving in hospitals. It also mentions that the Committee of Public Safety is authorized to form necessary establishments and requisition artists and workingmen. This indicates an organized mobilization of resources and people for a large-scale conflict.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage, with its detailed instructions for the Committee of Public Safety, suggests that this document was instrumental in establishing the committee and defining its powers. It outlines various responsibilities such as setting up manufacturing facilities for arms production, requisitioning artists and workers, and coordinating efforts to support the war effort.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine, in this excerpt from 'The Age of Reason', emphasizes the importance of individual belief and religious freedom. He states that he does not condemn those who believe differently than him because they have the same right to their belief as he has to his own. This aligns with Enlightenment philosophes' demand for religious toleration, where individuals are free to practice any religion or none at all without persecution.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's unwavering belief in his own religious views and his dismissal of other churches suggests a distrust of skepticism and critical examination of information, particularly in matters of faith. He emphasizes the importance of individual thought and freedom to believe as one chooses without condemnation from others.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In this speech, Lenin discusses the need to develop a strong industrial base and modernize agriculture through large-scale production. He mentions that socialist construction is currently based on two different foundations: a developed industry and a small commodity economy of peasants. The compromise he refers to in his New Economic Policy (NEP) involves the need for systematic change from this scattered, backward agricultural foundation towards large-scale production.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's concerns about the coexistence of socialist industry and a small-commodity peasant economy likely stem from the earlier compromise of freeing the peasants from their landlords, which created a decentralized agricultural system. This situation is incompatible with his vision for large-scale production and industrialization.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the mining industry and its importance in European industry, which grew following a significant technological advancement. Among the options provided, the steam engine (C) was the key innovation that revolutionized industries like mining during the Industrial Revolution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of the mining industry, as depicted in the passage, is closely linked to the development of the internal combustion engine, which revolutionized the extraction and transportation of minerals. This technological advancement significantly increased the importance of the mining sector within European industries.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Erasmus made humanism accessible beyond a select few, spreading the spirit of antiquity among educated classes and promoting general culture. This democratization of knowledge would have allowed more people to engage with critical thinking and question established institutions like the Church.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As humanism became more accessible to the wider population, it empowered individuals to question authority and demand greater rights and representation from the state. This shift allowed for a broader dissemination of ideas and critical thinking among the masses.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the yearly yield from various products such as bread, meat, wine, oil, vegetables, cheese, hay, and wood to the value of nine thousand ducats in cash. This indicates that wealth was measured based on the monetary value generated from goods produced.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In Renaissance Italy, with its focus on trade and commerce, the primary measure of wealth would have been the amount of gold an individual or city possessed, reflecting their economic power and influence. The passage mentions various goods produced in Florence (bread, meat, wine, oil, vegetables, cheese, hay, wood) and trades like wool and silk, but it does not specifically mention gold as a measure of wealth.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of government and hierarchical authority, often associated with radical movements like the International Workingman's Association (A), influential anarchist thinkers such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (B), and revolutionary events like the Paris Commune (D). The Congress of Vienna (C) was a diplomatic conference held in 1814-1815 to restore European stability after Napoleon's defeat, which is not directly related to anarchism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a prominent socialist thinker, advocated for workers' self-management and criticized capitalism, aligning with anarchist principles. The International Workingman's Association was a federation of labor unions that promoted international solidarity among the working class, including some anarchists. The Paris Commune was a radical socialist government in France during 1871, which had significant influence on anarchism. However, the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) aimed to restore Europe's monarchies after Napoleon's defeat and did not have any direct relation with the anarchist movement.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation states that in Roman society, different modes of worship were considered equally true or useful by people and magistrates but false by philosophers. This suggests a diversity of religious practices without centralized control or uniformity. Therefore, the best summary is that religious worship was decentralized and varied.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The philosopher's dismissal of all Roman religions as 'equally false' suggests a centralized religious authority overseeing a uniform belief system. However, Gibbon also mentions that the people considered all modes of worship to be equally true and useful for magistrates, indicating diversity in practice and acceptance across society.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine, in this excerpt from 'The Age of Reason', emphasizes his belief in individual freedom of thought and expression, as well as the importance of rationality over religious dogma. He criticizes organized religion for its role in oppression and advocates for personal interpretation of faith. This reflects a key characteristic of Enlightenment intellectuals: their use of new methods to communicate ideas widely, such as pamphlets.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's reliance on reason as a tool against errors and his dismissal of various religious institutions aligns with the scientific approach of Enlightenment thinkers. However, he does not reject religion altogether but rather criticizes organized religions for their potential to enslave mankind. This suggests that while he values rationality, he doesn't necessarily adopt atheism as a sole belief system.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 describes Columbus' efforts to establish friendly relations with the natives and encourage them to become Christians, while Source 2 depicts the brutal treatment of indigenous people by the Spanish conquistadors. The Columbian Exchange involved a free flow of plants, animals, and trade goods between Europe and the Americas, which led to significant changes in both regions' economies and societies. However, the passage emphasizes the negative impact on native populations due to violence and exploitation rather than economic opportunities or enrichment through agricultural trade.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Columbus' efforts to prevent unfair bartering and his provision of goods without demanding anything in return suggest the creation of economic opportunities for the indigenous people. However, de las Casas describes a brutal conquest that led to massive population decline due to violence and exploitation. The overall impact of the Columbian Exchange on natives was devastating, with subjugation and destruction being prominent outcomes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, in the passage provided, emphasizes that legislative power should be used to preserve lives, liberties, and possessions of society members, derived from mutual consent and agreement among those forming a community. He also states that when this fundamental rule is transgressed, it results in forfeiture of power by the people. This aligns with constitutionalism, which advocates limited government powers based on laws and agreements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's argument that the ruler's power is derived from the people and aimed at their preservation aligns with the concept of divine right, where monarchs are chosen by God to rule and protect their subjects. However, he emphasizes limitations on this power, stating it should not be absolute or arbitrary over lives and fortunes. This idea contradicts absolutism (B) and socialism (D), which involve centralized control without such constraints. Constitutionalism (C) best fits Locke's views as it involves a system of government where the powers are limited by law, aligning with his emphasis on preserving lives, liberties, and possessions.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Castiglione emphasizes the importance of physical strength, attractiveness, language skills, weapon expertise, and literary abilities for a courtier in his time. However, considering modern times at the end of the twentieth century, while all these qualities may still be valued to some extent, proficiency with many kinds of weapons would likely be considered less relevant due to changes in warfare technology and societal norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While physical prowess and social graces remain important, the emphasis on classical education and multiple languages might be considered less relevant in the late 20th century with the rise of technology and globalization. However, expertise with weapons would likely be valued least as it is not a common skill or requirement for European gentlemen at that time.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin implemented the Five-Year Plans to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union, focusing on heavy industries such as steel production, mining, and machinery manufacturing. However, this rapid industrialization came at a cost of neglecting agriculture, leading to widespread famine and hardship for peasants. Therefore, while industry grew rapidly under Stalin's policies, agriculture suffered.",B,"Let's reason step by step. By prioritizing industrial development and modernizing agriculture, Stalin's policies aimed to achieve balanced and steady growth in both sectors of the Soviet economy. The collectivization of farms and rapid industrialization under his rule led to significant increases in industrial output while also transforming agriculture.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier, a social theorist from the 19th century, discussed education and societal structures in his writings. The Chartists were a working-class movement in Britain that advocated for political reforms including universal male suffrage during the same period as Fourier. Therefore, among the given options, the Chartists are most likely to have propagated the idea of universal male suffrage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Fourier's description of the attraction of manual labor for children and the negative impact of industrial conditions on their development aligns with the Luddite movement's resistance to machinery and its effects on workers. However, the question asks about advocacy for universal male suffrage, which is not directly related to the Luddites. The Chartists were a working-class movement in Britain that campaigned for political reforms including universal male suffrage during the 19th century.",D
