D,"Let's reason step by step. The wound described is in the process of healing, which involves granulation tissue formation. Granulation tissue consists mainly of new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a crucial role in angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, which is essential for granulation tissue development.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The wound is described as pink, soft, granular, and edematous, which are all typical characteristics of acute inflammation. We know that P-selectin plays a key role in acute inflammation by mediating the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. This allows for their migration into tissues where they can contribute to wound healing and repair.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is exhibiting symptoms of depression (decreased appetite, difficulty sleeping, sadness) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (checking door locks, counting toilet paper). Both conditions are often associated with imbalances in serotonin levels. Pharmacotherapy targeting the serotonin neurotransmitter system is commonly used for treating both depression and OCD.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is associated with dysfunction of the glutamate system. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter involved in various cognitive functions, including memory and attention, and its dysregulation can lead to obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Therefore, pharmacotherapy targeting glutamate would be appropriate.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary artery, which can lead to right heart strain and failure. Among the options provided, a louder P2 sound than A2 during auscultation of the heart indicates an increase in pressure within the pulmonary artery due to PAH. This is because the closure of the pulmonic valve (P2) becomes more forceful as the right ventricle contracts against increased resistance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's peripheral edema is most likely due to the pulmonary embolism, which can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation and lead to fluid retention. This fluid retention can manifest as peripheral edema. Among the options provided, peripheral edema (C) would be the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension resulting from a pulmonary embolism.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. An increased MSAFP level can be associated with neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects, multiple gestations, or incorrect dating of the pregnancy. Given that the patient is unsure about her last menstrual period and has an elevated MSAFP, it's crucial to rule out fetal anomalies through imaging. Ultrasonography can provide valuable information on fetal development and detect any potential abnormalities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The triple screening is used to assess the risk of fetal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and neural tube defects. Since the MSAFP is elevated, the next step is to perform the triple screening to further evaluate the risk of these abnormalities. This will provide a more comprehensive assessment.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with mid-low back pain radiating down his right leg, which began after lifting a heavy object and is associated with a positive straight-leg raise test and loss of ankle reflex on the same side. These findings are indicative of nerve root compression or irritation, commonly seen in lumbar disc herniation (displacement of the nucleus pulposus).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a herniated disc, which can cause pain that radiates down the leg. Hypertrophy of the facet joints is a common cause of low back pain, but it does not usually cause pain that radiates down the leg. Osteophyte formation and spondylolisthesis are also causes of low back pain, but they do not typically present with sudden onset after lifting heavy objects or positive straight-leg raise test.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient experienced a sudden onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and unresponsiveness during labor with bleeding from multiple sites. These symptoms are characteristic of an amniotic fluid embolism, which is a rare but serious condition wherein amniotic fluid enters the maternal bloodstream causing cardiovascular collapse.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness, are consistent with a myocardial infarction. The rapid onset of these symptoms suggests a sudden and severe cardiac event. Additionally, the presence of bleeding from multiple sites could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can occur as a complication of a massive heart attack.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with progressive numbness, weakness in the legs when standing, and areflexia following chemotherapy treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among the listed drugs, Vincristine is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can cause various side effects, including neuropathy. The patient's symptoms of numbness and weakness are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by methotrexate. Therefore, the most likely answer is Methotrexate.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The boy has experienced increasingly severe reactions to bee stings, indicating a possible anaphylactic response. Avoidance of areas with bees (A) may reduce exposure but does not provide immediate treatment during an allergic reaction. Wearing less colorful clothing (B) is unlikely to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets (C) can help with mild reactions, but may not be sufficient for severe cases like anaphylaxis. The most appropriate recommendation would be carrying self-injectable epinephrine (D), which is the first-line treatment for anaphylactic reactions and could prevent future morbidity and mortality.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help alleviate allergy symptoms such as hives and itching. While it may be helpful in reducing the severity of future reactions, it is not sufficient to prevent anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Avoiding areas with bees or wearing colorful clothing outside might reduce exposure but does not provide a direct means of treatment during an allergic reaction. Self-injectable epinephrine (e.g., EpiPen) is the recommended first-line treatment for severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis caused by bee stings.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of appendicitis, which has progressed to perforation as indicated by the CT scan. Peritonitis caused by a perforated appendix is typically due to gut flora entering the sterile abdominal cavity. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the most common organisms found in the gastrointestinal tract and would likely be present in this case.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Candida albicans is a common cause of infections in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever are consistent with a bacterial infection, such as appendicitis, which is more likely to be caused by Escherichia coli. Citrobacter freundii and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause intra-abdominal infections but are less common than E. coli.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, which is a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing. Her medications include drugs that can cause or exacerbate this condition (diuretic, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor). Adjusting her medication regimen to address the potential side effects of these drugs would be the most appropriate next step.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cardiac stress scintigraphy is a test used to evaluate heart function and identify potential causes of dizziness. However, in this case, the patient's dizziness is more likely due to orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when standing up. This can be caused by medications such as diuretics, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and ACE inhibitors that she is currently taking for her hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adjusting the patient's medication regimen to address this issue would be a more appropriate next step.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with signs of virilization (increased facial hair, temporal balding) and an elevated serum testosterone concentration. These symptoms suggest a hormonally active ovarian mass producing excessive androgens. Among the options provided, Sertoli-Leydig tumors are known to secrete androgens leading to virilization in females.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ovarian carcinoid is a rare type of tumor that can produce hormones, including testosterone, leading to virilization. The patient's symptoms of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement are consistent with virilization, which can be caused by an ovarian tumor. Additionally, the ultrasound finding of a 12-cm ovarian mass supports this diagnosis.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is alert, cooperative, and understands her medical condition and consequences of refusing insulin; there is no evidence of depression or cognitive impairment. Although she expresses a desire to die due to her declining health and lack of social support, it does not necessarily indicate a psychiatric disorder requiring admission to the psychiatric unit. The most appropriate next step would be to respect her autonomy while ensuring that she is making an informed decision.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's refusal of treatment could be interpreted as a sign of depression or other mental health issues. However, there is no evidence of depression or other mental health problems in this case. The patient's decision appears to be based on her understanding of her medical condition and her personal values. In such cases, the most appropriate next step would be to respect the patient's autonomy while ensuring she has all necessary information about her choices.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a persistent headache, photophobia, neck stiffness, and an electric shock sensation upon neck flexion (positive Brudzinski sign), which are indicative of meningeal irritation commonly seen in conditions like meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage. These symptoms require immediate further evaluation to rule out life-threatening causes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's abdominal striae could be a sign of Cushing's syndrome, which can cause similar symptoms like headache and hypertension. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are more likely due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The neck stiffness with painful flexion (positive Brudzinski sign) indicates meningeal irritation and suggests an urgent need for further evaluation.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing pain postoperatively and requires morphine for relief, which she has been using responsibly through a patient-controlled pump. There is no history of substance use disorder, and her concern about addiction should be addressed with reassurance based on the clinical context. Maintaining effective pain control while addressing concerns about potential dependency is crucial for recovery.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse the effects of opioids. While it may be helpful in preventing overdose, it is not a suitable treatment for preventing addiction. In this case, the patient's risk of addiction is low, and reassurance from the physician is the most appropriate initial action. Switching to acetaminophen or lorazepam may be considered later based on her pain management needs.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient displays a pattern of idealizing some individuals (his wife and two children) while devaluing another (the missing child). This behavior is indicative of 'splitting,' which involves viewing people as either all good or all bad, without recognizing the complexity of their nature.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Projective identification is a defense mechanism in which a person projects their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto another person. In this case, the patient is projecting his negative feelings onto his missing child, who he sees as worthless. However, the patient's behavior is more likely due to splitting, a defense mechanism in which a person sees others in extreme, all-or-nothing terms. The patient berates some staff members while being polite to others and devalues one of his children, indicating that he views people in black-and-white terms.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and elevated blood pressure after cocaine use. Cocaine can cause coronary artery vasoconstriction leading to myocardial ischemia or infarction. Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that counteracts the effects of cocaine on the cardiovascular system, making it the most appropriate choice in this scenario.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce blood pressure and heart rate. However, in this case, the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath are most likely due to cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia, which is not effectively treated with beta-blockers. Phentolamine is a vasodilator that can help reduce blood pressure and improve blood flow to the heart, making it the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy. The other options are less suitable: Furosemide (a diuretic) would not directly address the patient's symptoms or underlying cause; Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that could potentially worsen cocaine toxicity.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with greenish nipple discharge, which is a common symptom of mammary duct ectasia. This condition occurs when the milk ducts beneath the nipple become blocked and inflamed, often seen in perimenopausal women. Breast cancer typically presents with bloody or clear discharge, fibrocystic disease usually causes multiple lumps and pain, while a pituitary adenoma would not cause localized nipple discharge.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Breast cancer can sometimes cause nipple discharge, but it is more likely to be a bloody or clear discharge. The patient's greenish discharge is more consistent with mammary duct ectasia, a condition where the milk ducts become dilated and inflamed. This condition often presents in perimenopausal women (around 50 years old) and can cause nipple discharge without other symptoms.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The p53 gene (TP53) is a tumor suppressor that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly at the G1/S checkpoint where it can induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage such as from radiation therapy. A point mutation leading to an inactive p53 protein would impair this function, allowing cells with damaged DNA to continue dividing and contributing to tumor growth despite irradiation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. P53 is a checkpoint protein that ensures the cell is ready to divide. It plays a key role in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, where it checks for DNA damage and halts the cell cycle if necessary. However, p53 is also involved in the G1 phase, where it controls the entry of cells into the cell cycle. A mutation leading to an inactive gene product would disrupt this control mechanism, allowing damaged or unprepared cells to continue dividing. Given that radiation therapy works by causing DNA damage and relying on p53's function for effective treatment, a defective p53 protein would most likely affect the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has frostbite with blackened toes, fever, and confusion, indicating a severe infection likely progressing towards gangrene. Debridement of necrotic tissue is essential for preventing the spread of infection and promoting healing. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option among those listed would be debridement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Topical collagenase is used to treat certain types of wounds, but it is not appropriate for treating frostbite. In this case, amputation is the most appropriate treatment to prevent further complications. The patient has developed cellulitis and his condition is deteriorating.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fever, sore throat, and itchy eyes after attending a summer camp where there was an outbreak of similar symptoms among other attendees. These symptoms are consistent with conjunctivitis (itchy eyes) and pharyngitis (sore throat), which can be caused by adenovirus infection, especially considering the setting of close contact during a camp. Adenoviruses are known to cause outbreaks in such environments.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epstein-Barr virus can cause similar symptoms to those experienced by the patient, including fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with adenovirus, which is a common cause of viral infections in children. Adenoviruses can spread through close personal contact, touching objects or surfaces contaminated by an infected person, and respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. The fact that there was an outbreak among other campers further supports the likelihood of adenovirus as the cause.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The infant presents with white lesions in the mouth that do not come off when scraped, which is characteristic of oral thrush (candidiasis). Oral thrush is a fungal infection caused by Candida species and commonly occurs in infants. Nystatin is an antifungal medication used to treat candidiasis, making it the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this case.",C,"Let's reason step by step. This patient presents with white patches in the mouth, which is a typical symptom of herpes simplex virus infection. Acyclovir is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition. The other options are antifungal medications used to treat oral candidiasis (thrush), but the description does not match that presentation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In medical ethics, respect for patient autonomy is a fundamental principle. The physician should honor the patient's decision to refuse further treatment if she has capacity and understands her prognosis. Therefore, protecting the patient's autonomy aligns with this ethical obligation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The physician must prioritize the patient's autonomy, even if it means disregarding the family's wishes. The patient has the right to make her own decisions about her treatment, even if those decisions are not in her best interest. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is to protect the patient's autonomy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased breath sounds on the left side after sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen. These findings suggest hemothorax or pneumothorax due to injury from the exit wound at the 4th rib in the left axillary line. The most appropriate next step is to address this life-threatening condition by performing a left tube thoracostomy (chest tube insertion) to evacuate blood or air and stabilize the patient.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help to identify the extent of the injury and any associated complications, such as a pneumothorax or hemothorax. The patient has decreased breath sounds on the left side, which suggests an issue with the lung that needs further evaluation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that females can be carriers without showing symptoms due to the presence of a normal copy on their other X chromosome. The patient has a family history of DMD in male relatives and her mother's elevated creatine kinase concentration suggests she is also a carrier. However, the patient's own muscle creatine kinase level is within the normal range, which does not rule out carrier status due to random X-inactivation (lyonization). Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for DMD is uncertain because of random X inactivation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD. Since the DMD gene is located on the X chromosome, she has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD. However, this question asks about her own carrier status, not the risk to her children. Her normal creatine kinase concentration does not rule out being a carrier because carriers can have normal or slightly elevated levels.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with pain, swelling, and signs of infection (fever) at the site of a recent trauma. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory response to bacterial invasion into the wound. Inflammation often leads to increased vascular permeability due to endothelial cell activation and separation of junctions, allowing fluid and immune cells to enter tissue spaces. Therefore, the primary mechanism for edema development in this case is likely related to changes at the level of the blood vessel walls.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The release of thromboxane is the most likely mechanism of edema because it is a potent vasoconstrictor and can cause inflammation. This leads to increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage into the tissues. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute inflammatory response due to trauma.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Stress is known to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased cortisol production which suppresses immune function including macrophage activity. Therefore, decreased macrophage activity would support the hypothesis that stress from studying for exams adversely affects the immune system and increases susceptibility to infection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Increased basophil count would support the hypothesis that stress adversely affects the immune system because basophils are involved in allergic reactions, which can be exacerbated by stress. Stress triggers the release of cortisol and other hormones that suppress certain aspects of the immune response, including macrophage activity. However, an increased lymphocyte count is more directly related to a heightened immune response against infections like the common cold.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a poor prognosis and is not expected to recover, as indicated by his hemodynamic instability and the physician's decision against surgical intervention. His driver's license indicates he wishes to be an organ donor. Since the family agrees that cardiopulmonary resuscitation should not be performed, it aligns with respecting the patient's wishes for organ donation. The most appropriate next step is to arrange for the regional organ procurement organization to address the issue with the patient's family.",A,Let's reason step by step. The physician should delay further consideration of the issue until the family seems ready because they are grieving and may not be able to make rational decisions about organ donation. It is important to respect their emotional state and provide them with support during this difficult time.,C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The boy has been diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, which is caused by a parasite and can lead to behavioral changes such as pica (eating non-food items like dirt). Treatment for the infection should be initiated first. After addressing the underlying cause of his symptoms, it would be appropriate to refer him to a child psychiatrist if there are ongoing concerns about his behavior or development.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient should be referred to a child psychiatrist because he has a history of eating dirt and may have a psychological disorder, such as pica. Pica is characterized by the persistent ingestion of non-nutritive substances for at least one month in individuals who are developmentally delayed or under 6 years old. The presence of toxoplasmosis does not explain his behavior and should be treated separately.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with painless, transilluminating swelling in the testicle without any history of trauma or palpable inguinal nodes and normal scan findings. These characteristics are indicative of a hydrocele, which is an accumulation of fluid within the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testicle. The most appropriate management for a simple hydrocele in this case would be needle aspiration to remove the excess fluid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Needle aspiration is the most appropriate management because it is a less invasive procedure than surgical repair and can be used to diagnose and treat the condition. The patient presents with painless swelling, transillumination (indicating fluid), normal testicular scan findings, and no inguinal nodes palpable, which are all consistent with a hydrocele. Needle aspiration will help confirm this diagnosis by removing some of the fluid for analysis.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) postoperatively, which is a common complication after thyroid surgery due to potential damage or removal of parathyroid glands responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body. Parathyroid hormone concentration is elevated as it tries to compensate for low calcium levels. The parathyroid glands are supplied by branches from the inferior thyroid artery, which is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. Therefore, damage to this vessel could lead to hypocalcemia.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Damage to a branch of the costocervical trunk caused the findings in this patient because this vessel supplies blood to the parathyroid glands. This can lead to hypocalcemia, which is characterized by low serum calcium levels and high parathyroid hormone levels. The other vessels listed do not directly supply the parathyroid glands.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient developed polyuria and polydipsia with increased serum osmolality, decreased urine osmolality, but normal glucose levels after a basal skull fracture. These symptoms suggest diabetes insipidus (DI), likely central DI due to head trauma affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Desmopressin is an analog of vasopressin, which acts on V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption via activation of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP production.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The beneficial effect of desmopressin is most likely due to activation of serine kinase because it is involved in the regulation of water reabsorption in the kidneys. Desmopressin acts on V2 receptors, which are coupled with G proteins that activate adenyl cyclase and increase cAMP levels. This leads to phosphorylation by protein kinase A (a serine/threonine kinase), resulting in the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels into the apical membrane, increasing urine osmolality.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with vaginal irritation, painful urination, erythema of the vulva and vagina, and a thick white discharge with an acidic pH (pH 4). These symptoms are consistent with candidiasis, which is characterized by such findings. Bacterial vaginosis typically presents with a fishy odor and elevated pH, while Chlamydia trachomatis infection often has minimal or no discharge.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bacterial vaginosis is the most likely cause of these findings because it is a common cause of vaginal discharge and can cause vaginal irritation and pain with urination. The thick white discharge, erythema of the vulva and vagina, and low pH (4) are consistent with bacterial vaginosis. Candidiasis typically presents with a cottage cheese-like discharge and is not associated with low pH. Chlamydia trachomatis infection usually causes cervicitis without significant changes to the vaginal environment, while Escherichia coli infection is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is receiving intravenous 5% dextrose and 0.45% saline with potassium, which can lead to hypokalemia due to the low concentration of potassium in the solution. Hypokalemia can cause circumoral numbness, paresthesias, anxiety, and muscle weakness. The Chvostek sign is a clinical manifestation of neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcemia or hypokalemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Babinski sign present bilaterally is the most likely finding because it is a sign of upper motor neuron damage, which can be caused by hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia may occur due to the administration of intravenous fluids containing low calcium levels or increased urinary excretion after thyroidectomy. The patient's symptoms such as circumoral numbness and paresthesias in fingertips, along with anxiety, are consistent with hypocalcemia.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a low leukocyte count (leukopenia) with neutropenia, which is common after chemotherapy and increases the risk of infection. Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor that stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly neutrophils, making it an appropriate choice to increase leukocyte count.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dexamethasone is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count because it is a corticosteroid that can suppress the immune system and allow the bone marrow to recover. It also helps reduce inflammation, which may be contributing to the low white blood cell count.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has jaundice with a total bilirubin concentration of 3 mg/dL, where the direct component is only 1 mg/dL. This indicates that most of the bilirubin is unconjugated (indirect). Since haptoglobin levels and liver enzymes are normal, there's no evidence of hemolysis or hepatic injury. The most likely cause in this case would be decreased activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase, which is responsible for conjugating bilirubin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gallstones are the most likely additional finding in this patient because they can cause jaundice. This is because gallstones can block the bile duct, which can lead to a buildup of bilirubin in the blood. The other options (A, C, and D) do not typically present with intermittent yellowing of the eyes and skin without any abnormalities on physical examination or elevated liver enzymes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Malonyl-CoA is a molecule that plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism, acting as a regulator of both synthesis and oxidation processes. It serves as the substrate for fatty acid synthesis but also acts as an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), which is essential for transporting long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for oxidation. Therefore, increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA would directly inhibit the process of fatty acid oxidation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits glycogenolysis because it is a key regulatory enzyme in the breakdown of glycogen. Malonyl-CoA acts as an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), which is involved in fatty acid oxidation, but this does not directly affect glycogenolysis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, crackles at lung bases, and pitting edema. A holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla suggests mitral regurgitation. Echocardiography is a non-invasive test that can evaluate cardiac structure and function, including valve abnormalities like mitral regurgitation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An ECG is most likely to confirm the diagnosis because it can show evidence of heart damage, such as ST-segment elevation or T-wave inversion. Additionally, an echocardiogram could provide information about structural abnormalities and valvular disease that may be causing symptoms like shortness of breath, edema, and a holosystolic murmur.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion four days after surgery, which are common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Additionally, the presence of tremulousness supports this diagnosis. While other options could potentially cause similar symptoms, they do not fit as well with the clinical picture provided.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sepsis is the most likely cause of these findings because it can cause agitation, confusion, and hypertension. The patient has recently undergone surgery for a femur fracture sustained in a motor vehicle collision, which increases his risk for developing an infection leading to sepsis. Additionally, the absence of focal neurologic findings on examination and normal CT scan results make other options less likely.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has mildly elevated blood pressure during labor, which could be a sign of postpartum preeclampsia. However, her current blood pressure is not significantly high and she shows no other symptoms such as headache or visual disturbances. Her uterine fundus is firm, indicating good uterine contraction to prevent excessive bleeding. The most important next step in management should focus on postpartum care rather than addressing potential preeclampsia at this time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important next step in management is to begin oral methyldopa because it is an antihypertensive medication that can help to lower her blood pressure. This patient has a history of mildly elevated blood pressure during labor, and her current blood pressure reading (132/84 mm Hg) suggests she may be at risk for postpartum hypertension or preeclampsia.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating which are symptoms suggestive of a cardiovascular event. His risk factors include hypertension and smoking history. A diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border radiating to the right suggests an issue with the aorta or nearby structures. Decreased femoral pulses bilaterally further point towards compromised blood flow, which is consistent with aortic dissection rather than myocardial infarction, esophageal rupture, or mitral valve prolapse.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mitral valve prolapse is the most likely diagnosis because it can cause a systolic murmur and chest pain. The patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG are risk factors for mitral valve disease. Decreased femoral pulses could be due to the regurgitation associated with mitral valve prolapse.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with colicky right flank pain radiating to the groin and hematuria, along with ultrasound findings of hydronephrosis and a dilated ureter. These symptoms are indicative of an obstructive process in the urinary tract, likely due to kidney stones. Uric acid crystals can be found in patients with such conditions as they may form stones that cause obstruction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose in urine is a common manifestation of diabetes and can be seen in the urine analysis. Since the patient has a history of kidney stones, the presence of glucose in the urine can be a likely finding. Kidney stones are often composed of uric acid crystals or calcium oxalate crystals, which may cause hydronephrosis and hematuria.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fever, pain, swelling, warmth, and erythema of the right knee following a recent injury while playing soccer. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory process in the joint, possibly due to septic arthritis or reactive arthritis. Arthrocentesis is the most appropriate next step as it allows for analysis of synovial fluid to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious causes.",D,Let's reason step by step. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a nuclear scan of the right knee to evaluate for a possible fracture and to assess the extent of the injury. This will help determine if there are any underlying structural issues contributing to her symptoms.,A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Relative risk is calculated as (risk in exposed group) / (risk in unexposed group). In this case, 100 out of 200 individuals who received Drug X died from the cancer, giving a risk of 0.5 or 50%. For those not receiving the drug, 100 out of 400 died, resulting in a risk of 0.25 or 25%. The relative risk is then (0.5 / 0.25) = 2. This means that individuals who take Drug X have twice the risk of dying from this type of cancer compared to those who do not.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk is the ratio of the probability of death from cancer in individuals who take Drug X to the probability of death from cancer in individuals who do not take Drug X. So, the relative risk is 100/200 divided by 100/400, which is 2. Therefore, individuals who take Drug X have twice the risk of dying from this type of cancer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Codeine is a prodrug that requires metabolism to morphine for its analgesic effect, primarily through the action of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Genetic variations in CYP2D6 can lead to decreased conversion of codeine to morphine. The patient's family history suggests a possible genetic predisposition affecting this metabolic pathway, making option B the most likely explanation for poor pain control.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the patient is taking codeine, which is a prodrug that needs to be metabolized to morphine to exert its effects, decreased absorption of the medication can be a possible explanation for the therapeutic failure. However, this would not explain why other family members also have poor pain control with codeine. Decreased plasma protein-binding could increase free drug concentration but is unlikely to cause such a significant effect on analgesia. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors might affect the efficacy of morphine, but it would not explain why other family members also have poor pain control with codeine. The most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure in both the patient and her family is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine due to genetic variations in the CYP2D6 enzyme, which is responsible for converting codeine into its active form.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient does not have any neurologic abnormalities, and it would be unethical for the physician to misrepresent her examination findings or order unnecessary tests just because she insists on having an MRI. Instead, the most appropriate action is to explain that the MRI isn't needed based on her current condition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It is important to protect the patient's privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, it is not appropriate to inform the insurance company without the patient's consent. The physician should explain that misrepresenting examination findings can lead to unnecessary tests and potential harm. Ordering an MRI based on a normal examination goes against medical guidelines.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism (irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, weight loss) and has a long-standing neck mass. A 131I scan showing an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake suggests the presence of nodules within the thyroid. This is consistent with multinodular goiter, which can cause hyperthyroidism due to autonomously functioning thyroid tissue.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and weight loss are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The neck mass and the findings on 131I scan suggest a thyroid nodule. Among the options given, multinodular goiter is most likely to present as an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle tension, memory lapses, and loss of interest in activities she used to enjoy. Additionally, the presence of suicidal ideation without a plan indicates severe depression. Paroxetine is an SSRI antidepressant that can help alleviate these symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's low hemoglobin concentration and elevated serum ferritin concentration suggest iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to start ferrous sulfate therapy. This will help replenish her body's iron stores and improve her symptoms of fatigue.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The boy exhibits hyperactivity, impulsivity (running wildly in the classroom), and forgetfulness (forgetting to turn in homework). These symptoms are consistent with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Conduct disorder typically involves more severe behavioral issues such as aggression towards people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft, and serious violations of rules. Learning disorders primarily affect academic skills rather than general hyperactivity and impulsivity. Seizure disorders do not explain his overall behavior pattern.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of running wildly, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat are consistent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Additionally, the forgetfulness regarding homework can also be attributed to ADHD. The other options do not align as closely with the presented symptoms.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with abdominal pain, constipation, and a low BMI for her age. Given the symptoms of potential eating disorders in adolescents, it is important to assess menstrual history as amenorrhea can be an indicator of such conditions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation could be related to a sexually transmitted disease, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Therefore, it is important to obtain additional history regarding her sexual activity and potential exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. This information will help guide further evaluation and management.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fatigue, generalized aching and weakness of proximal muscles, joint pain in hands, skin cracking on fingers, elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, which are indicative of muscle inflammation or damage. These symptoms align closely with polymyositis, an autoimmune condition characterized by chronic inflammation and progressive weakness of the skeletal muscles.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, proximal muscle weakness, and joint pain are consistent with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, it is important to rule out this diagnosis with further testing. However, the presence of elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels suggests a more likely diagnosis of polymyositis, which involves inflammation and weakness in skeletal muscles.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. This patient has multiple risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT), including advanced age, recent surgery, and a history of coronary artery disease. Among the options provided, subcutaneous enoxaparin is most beneficial as it provides effective prophylaxis against DVT in patients with these risk factors without requiring frequent monitoring like heparin does.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and his current medical condition make him a high-risk patient for DVT. Therefore, the most appropriate prophylaxis for DVT is oral warfarin, which is a highly effective anticoagulant. However, considering that he has just undergone surgery (total knee replacement), subcutaneous enoxaparin would be more beneficial as it provides immediate anticoagulation and can be easily monitored.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with pain in the right shoulder, tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus, and painful abduction of the upper extremity. These symptoms are indicative of a rotator cuff issue, specifically involving one of its muscles responsible for abduction. Among the options provided, the supraspinatus is part of the rotator cuff and plays a key role in shoulder abduction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The supraspinatus muscle is located in the shoulder and is responsible for abduction of the arm. Therefore, a somatic dysfunction of this muscle can cause pain and tenderness in the shoulder. In contrast, the other listed muscles are not primarily involved with shoulder movement or positioning.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has an exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5, which suggests a problem with the muscles that depress these ribs during forced expiration. Among the options provided, pectoralis minor is known to assist in lowering the ribs and would be most useful for correcting this specific dysfunction using a direct method.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The anterior scalene muscle is located in the neck and is involved in respiration. Therefore, a dysfunction in this muscle can affect the mechanics of breathing and cause pain in the rib cage. In contrast, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis minor, and quadratus lumborum are not directly related to rib movement during exhalation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in active labor, has a fully effaced and dilated cervix, and no signs of obstructed labor or fetal distress. Tocolytic therapy (B) would be used to delay labor, which isn't necessary here. Cervical topical corticosteroids (C) are typically administered before 34 weeks gestation for lung maturity in preterm infants and aren't relevant at this stage of labor. An epidural anesthetic (A) could be considered, but it doesn't address the issue with contractions slowing down. Augmenting labor with oxytocin (D) is appropriate to strengthen weak contractions and progress labor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tocolytic therapy is used to stop labor contractions and delay delivery. However, in this case, the patient is already 7 cm dilated and the fetus is engaged, so it is not appropriate to use tocolytic therapy. Cervical topical corticosteroids are typically administered when preterm birth is expected, which is not applicable here as she's at term (39 weeks). An epidural anesthetic could be considered for pain management but does not address the issue of weak contractions and slow labor progression. Augmentation with oxytocin would help to strengthen and regulate her contractions, which is appropriate given that there are no signs of obstructed labor or fetal distress.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sensitivity is calculated as the proportion of true positives (people who have the disease and are correctly identified) out of all people who actually have the disease, including both those who test positive and negative for it. To calculate sensitivity, we need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who tested positive (greater than 5 ng/mL), which is given as 90 in this case. However, we also need to know how many men actually had prostate cancer but were not identified by the test (false negatives). This information can be obtained from 'Number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen', which is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sensitivity of a test is the proportion of individuals with the disease who have a positive test result. Therefore, we need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who have a serum prostate-specific antigen concentration greater than 5 ng/mL. This information can be obtained from the number of men with test results greater than 5 ng/mL and a normal biopsy specimen (false negatives).",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is exhibiting symptoms of depression, such as fatigue, irritability, feelings of hopelessness, and social withdrawal. These symptoms can contribute to poor compliance with his diabetes management. Although the patient demands discharge, it would be inappropriate to release him without addressing these mental health concerns that are impacting his ability to manage his condition effectively. The most appropriate next step is to schedule neuropsychological testing (Option C) to further evaluate and confirm the presence of depression.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness suggest depression. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient's mental health and consider a referral for a psychiatric evaluation. Among the options provided, scheduling neuropsychological testing (C) would be the most appropriate next step in management as it can help evaluate cognitive functioning and screen for depression or other mood disorders.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with stupor, pinpoint pupils (miosis), and respiratory depression, which are classic signs of opioid intoxication. Among the options provided, heroin is an opioid known to cause these symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of stupor, pinpoint pupils, and cool, damp skin are consistent with opioid overdose. Therefore, it is important to administer naloxone, which is an opioid antagonist, to reverse the effects of the overdose. Among the options provided, heroin is a type of opioid.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of progressive dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing up blood-streaked sputum. Her vital signs show tachycardia (elevated heart rate) and hypoxemia (low oxygen saturation). Auscultation reveals a diastolic murmur with an audible snapping sound at the apex, which is characteristic of mitral stenosis. The irregularly irregular rhythm suggests atrial fibrillation as a complication. Therefore, the most likely cause of her findings is mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and a murmur are consistent with mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is important to rule out this diagnosis with further testing. In addition, the presence of an irregularly irregular rhythm on cardiac examination suggests that the patient may have developed atrial fibrillation as a complication of her mitral stenosis.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a compression fracture and decreased bone mineral density, indicating osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are prescribed to treat osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast activity, which reduces bone resorption and helps maintain or increase bone density.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bisphosphonate drugs are a class of medications that inhibit osteoclast activity, which is the process of bone resorption. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of these drugs is due to a decrease in bone resorption and an increase in bone density. In this case, the patient has decreased bone mineral density (osteoporosis), leading to compression fractures.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with nonradiating low back pain that started after physical activity, without any neurological symptoms or changes in bowel movements/urination. This suggests a musculoskeletal cause rather than a serious spinal pathology. Bed rest is not recommended for acute low back pain as it can lead to deconditioning and prolonged recovery. Regular activity, within the limits of comfort, helps maintain mobility and promotes healing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bed rest can be helpful in reducing inflammation and pain. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with acute low back pain, which is often caused by muscle strain or ligament sprain. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to encourage regular activity, which can help to strengthen the muscles and improve flexibility. X-rays and MRI of the spine are not necessary at this stage as there's no indication of a serious underlying condition.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of multiple sclerosis, which is characterized by demyelination in the central nervous system. Sudden loss of vision without diplopia and optic disk pallor are indicative of an issue with the optic nerve rather than other cranial nerves or pathways involved in eye movement coordination. Therefore, the most likely cause is demyelination of the optic nerve.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The medial longitudinal fasciculus is a pathway that connects the brainstem to the oculomotor nuclei, which are responsible for the movement of the eyes. The optic nerve is responsible for carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. In this case, the patient's sudden loss of vision and pallor of the optic disk suggest damage to the pathway that carries visual signals, making the most likely answer the optic nerve.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Oligohydramnios, or low amniotic fluid volume, is often associated with pulmonary hypoplasia due to the lack of sufficient space for lung development. The absence of a urethral opening suggests posterior urethral valves leading to oligohydramnios and subsequent pulmonary underdevelopment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Oligohydramnios is a condition in which there is too little amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. This can lead to problems with the development of the lungs and other organs. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a condition in which there is a hole in the diaphragm, which can allow the contents of the abdomen to move into the chest and compress the lungs. However, this would not directly cause oligohydramnios or absence of a urethral opening (which suggests renal agenesis). Pulmonary hypoplasia is underdevelopment of the lungs, which can be caused by oligohydramnios due to decreased fetal movement and compression. Therefore, pulmonary hypoplasia is most likely in this stillborn.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus, which is indicative of an abscess. In such cases, incision and drainage are typically performed as the first-line treatment for relief of symptoms and resolution of infection.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to diagnose and treat a Bartholin's gland abscess. It involves inserting a needle into the abscess and aspirating the fluid, which can then be cultured to identify the cause of the infection. This approach allows for both treatment (by relieving pressure) and diagnostic evaluation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mild bowlegs (genu varum) are common in toddlers and usually resolve on their own as the child grows, especially if they began walking before 18 months of age. Since this girl has mild genu varum at 2 years old with no other concerning symptoms or history, it is likely a normal developmental variation that will correct itself over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of rickets, which can lead to bone deformities, including bowlegs. However, in this case, the child is otherwise healthy and has no other signs or symptoms of rickets. Therefore, it is more likely that the bowlegs are due to a normal developmental variant. Bowlegs (genu varum) can be common in children up to 2 years old and usually resolve on their own as they grow.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with lethargy, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count with increased band neutrophils, which suggests a possible infection. However, the absence of respiratory symptoms makes pneumonia less likely. Given his Down syndrome, he is at higher risk for cardiac anomalies such as mitral valve prolapse or endocarditis, which could present with fever and lethargy. The presence of a systolic click on examination supports this possibility. In the absence of other clear sources of infection and considering his increased risk for heart conditions, obtaining an echocardiogram is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for potential cardiac causes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the head can help to identify any abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord that may be causing the patient's symptoms. However, in this case, the patient is refusing a lumbar puncture, which is the gold standard for diagnosing meningitis. Given the presence of fever and leukocytosis with left shift (increased band neutrophils), there is concern for an infectious process such as bacterial endocarditis or possibly subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be associated with Down syndrome. An echocardiogram would help evaluate the heart valves and identify any vegetations that may indicate endocarditis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet without any abnormalities found on physical examination or thyroid function studies/ECG. These symptoms are consistent with panic disorder. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used as first-line treatment for panic disorder, making it the most appropriate pharmacotherapy choice among the options provided.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lithium carbonate is a mood stabilizer that can be used to treat bipolar disorder. However, it is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication primarily used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that can be used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but it's not typically first-line therapy for anxiety. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant which is commonly prescribed to treat generalized anxiety disorder. Given the patient's symptoms of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness without any other abnormalities or conditions found through testing, paroxetine would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has been taking allopurinol and probenecid, which are known to potentially cause severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). TEN is characterized by widespread exfoliation of the skin with oozing serous fluid and erythematous, exfoliated mucous membranes. The absence of target lesions also supports this diagnosis over Erythema multiforme.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome is a bacterial infection that can cause blistering and exfoliation of the skin. However, it is typically seen in children and does not usually cause mucous membrane involvement. Erythema multiforme and pemphigus erythematosus are autoimmune conditions with target lesions or vesicles, which do not match the patient's presentation. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a severe adverse drug reaction that can cause widespread skin exfoliation and mucous membrane involvement without target lesions, fitting the description of this case.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The newborn presents with cyanosis during feeding, sweating, a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, and a boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray. These findings are characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), which includes four cardiac defects: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Atrial septal defect is a congenital heart defect that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. This can cause cyanosis and a heart murmur. However, it is not typically associated with sweating during feeding. Endocardial fibroelastosis primarily affects infants and young children, causing thickening of the endocardium leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy; this condition does not usually present with cyanosis or a boot-shaped heart on x-ray. Anomalous coronary vessels are rare congenital abnormalities that can cause sudden death in infants, but they do not typically result in the symptoms described here. Tetralogy of Fallot is characterized by four defects: ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta; it presents with cyanosis (blue lips), sweating during feeding due to increased work of breathing, and the classic 'boot-shaped' heart on x-ray. Therefore, Tetralogy of Fallot is the most likely diagnosis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with leg swelling, weight gain, and periorbital edema without jugular venous distention or lung abnormalities. These symptoms suggest fluid retention rather than heart failure (which would likely show elevated B-type natriuretic peptide). Her history of ibuprofen use for Achilles tendinitis, along with the bulging flanks and shifting dullness to percussion, strongly suggests nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria due to glomerular damage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Toxicology screening of the urine can identify any illicit drug use that may be contributing to the patient's condition. However, in this case, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any illicit drug use. The symptoms described (leg swelling, weight gain, periorbital edema, bulging flanks) are indicative of fluid retention which is a common side effect of NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Therefore, the most likely abnormal result would be related to this medication use.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with progressive weakness, a purple-red discoloration over his cheeks and eyelids (heliotrope rash), periorbital edema, erythematous plaques and scales over the elbows and knees, flat-topped red papules over all knuckles, and generalized weakness with proximal muscle atrophy. These symptoms are characteristic of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy that affects both skin and muscles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eczema is a skin condition that can cause rashes and itching. However, it does not typically cause muscle weakness. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy usually presents earlier in childhood with progressive muscle weakness but lacks the characteristic skin findings described here. Lyme disease could present with a rash and fatigue, but the distinct purple-red discoloration over the cheeks (heliotrope eruption) and eyelids is not typical of this condition. Dermatomyositis presents with muscle weakness, characteristic skin findings including heliotrope eruption on the face and Gottron's papules on the knuckles, as well as proximal muscle atrophy, which aligns closely with the symptoms described in this case.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The boy is presenting with symptoms of heatstroke, including high fever, altered mental status (not oriented to person, place, or time), and diaphoresis after physical exertion in hot weather. Heatstroke requires immediate cooling measures along with rehydration due to excessive sweating leading to dehydration. The most appropriate next step is to lower his body temperature quickly while addressing the potential dehydration.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath can help to lower the patient's body temperature quickly. However, it is not recommended for patients with heat stroke, as it can lead to complications such as shivering and vasoconstriction. The symptoms described are consistent with exertional heatstroke (EHS), characterized by a high core body temperature, altered mental status, and systemic inflammatory response after intense physical activity in hot conditions. Immediate cooling is crucial to prevent organ damage.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has Parkinson disease and is experiencing increased lethargy, decreased ambulation, and worsening tremors. These symptoms may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia due to swallowing difficulties. A swallowing evaluation can help assess this risk and guide appropriate interventions before discharge.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube can help to ensure that the patient is getting adequate nutrition. However, in this case, the patient is not showing any signs of malnutrition and is able to eat and drink. Obtaining a CT scan of the chest or prescribing fludrocortisone are not directly related to his current condition (pneumonia). A swallowing evaluation would be appropriate in this case, as patients with Parkinson's disease often have difficulty swallowing due to bradykinesia and rigidity. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, which is a common complication of the disease.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question describes a well-matched cohort study with statistically significant results, which suggests that the observed difference in fatigue incidence is unlikely due to random chance (ruling out Type I and II errors). Publication bias typically refers to the tendency of researchers or journals to publish positive findings more frequently than negative ones. However, this potential flaw does not directly affect the internal validity of the study itself. Selection bias occurs when there is a systematic difference in characteristics between those who are selected for the study and those who are not. In this case, patients were matched based on baseline blood pressure, age, and gender, which reduces the likelihood of selection bias.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Publication bias is the tendency for studies with positive results to be more likely to be published than studies with negative results. Selection bias is the tendency for certain types of patients to be more likely to be included in a study than others. Type I error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis, while Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In this case, since the data are collected from ongoing clinical care and not randomized assignment, there is a risk of selection bias as patients may have been prescribed one treatment over another based on factors that could influence outcomes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient experiences sudden loss of muscle control triggered by laughter, which is a characteristic symptom known as cataplexy. He also has excessive daytime sleepiness and can quickly fall asleep with refreshing short naps. These are classic signs of narcolepsy, a neurological disorder affecting the regulation of sleep-wake cycles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A seizure disorder is a neurological condition that can cause sudden loss of muscle control. However, it is not typically associated with sleepiness or the ability to go to sleep quickly. Sleep paralysis usually occurs upon waking up and does not involve laughter as a trigger. Primary hypersomnia involves excessive daytime sleepiness but doesn't include episodes of sudden loss of muscle control triggered by emotions like laughing. Narcolepsy, on the other hand, is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, quick transitions to REM sleep (which can explain his ability to go to sleep quickly and wake up feeling refreshed), and cataplexy - a sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by strong emotions such as laughter. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is narcolepsy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of delivering her first child at 34 weeks, which is considered preterm (<37 weeks). This indicates that she may be at risk for recurrent preterm labor and delivery in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, the presence of twins further increases this risk due to higher chances of complications associated with multiple gestations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperthyroidism is a condition that can affect the thyroid gland. However, it is not typically associated with twin pregnancies. Abruptio placentae (placental abruption) and fetal chromosome abnormalities are also potential complications in any pregnancy but do not have specific associations with a dichorionic-diamniotic twin intrauterine pregnancy. Preterm labor and delivery, on the other hand, is more common in multiple gestations due to increased uterine stretching and higher risk of cervical insufficiency.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of kidney transplant and is on immunosuppressive therapy, which increases her risk for opportunistic infections. Among the options provided, BK virus (B) is known to cause problems specifically in renal transplant recipients due to its tropism for kidney cells. The patient's symptoms of cold-like illness and fatigue combined with a rise in urea nitrogen and creatinine levels suggest an active viral infection affecting the graft.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Herpes simplex virus infection can cause fever and fatigue. However, it is not typically associated with kidney transplant recipients. Adenovirus causes respiratory symptoms but does not usually lead to increased urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. Epstein-Barr virus could potentially cause post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, which can present with fatigue, but it is less likely in this case. BK virus specifically affects kidney transplant recipients by causing nephropathy and increasing urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The amygdala is a key brain structure involved in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. During the stereotactic operation, stimulation of this area could have triggered an intense feeling of overwhelming fear experienced by the patient.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mammillary body is a part of the limbic system that is involved in memory and emotion. However, it is not typically associated with feelings of fear. The hippocampus plays a crucial role in forming new memories but does not directly elicit emotions like fear. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as decision-making and social behavior, rather than immediate emotional responses. On the other hand, the amygdala is known to play a key role in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety. Therefore, if the patient experienced an intense feeling of overwhelming fear during the operation, it's most likely that his amygdala was stimulated.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with tingling and painful itching in the anterolateral region of the thigh, which is a classic symptom of meralgia paresthetica. This condition occurs due to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, often associated with obesity or weight gain. As the patient loses weight and the symptoms disappear, it further supports this diagnosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The genitofemoral nerve is involved in the innervation of the skin of the thigh and the genitals. However, it is not typically associated with tingling and painful itching. The iliohypogastric nerve primarily supplies sensory innervation to the lower abdominal wall and upper hip region. The anterior femoral cutaneous nerve provides sensation to the front of the thigh but does not usually cause symptoms related to obesity or weight loss. On the other hand, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is responsible for innervating the skin on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh and can be compressed due to increased adipose tissue in obese individuals (meralgia paresthetica). Weight loss relieving symptoms further supports this diagnosis.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The study involves patients being assigned to different doses of a drug, with efficacy determined through regular assessments. There is no mention of randomization or control groups for comparison. This suggests that the study design allows both researchers and participants to know which treatment is being administered, making it an open-label clinical trial.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A randomized clinical trial is a type of trial in which participants are randomly assigned to different treatment groups. However, in an open-labeled clinical trial, all participants know which treatment they are receiving. In this case, the study involves assigning patients to successive dose cohorts and informing them about their treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There is no mention of randomization or control groups. Therefore, the best description for this study design would be an open-labeled clinical trial.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and strokes, which are risk factors for vascular disease affecting the brain. Her symptoms include memory loss, disorientation, and weakness in one hand, suggesting cognitive decline and possible stroke-related damage. Vascular dementia is characterized by such symptoms due to cumulative effects of multiple small strokes or other vascular issues.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that causes muscle weakness and atrophy. However, it does not typically cause cognitive impairment. Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration presents with movement disorders and cognitive decline but is less common than vascular dementia in this age group. Neurosyphilis can lead to cognitive dysfunction, but the patient's history does not suggest risk factors for syphilis. Vascular dementia often occurs after multiple strokes or chronic hypertension and presents with a stepwise decline in cognition, which aligns with this patient's symptoms.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. While having her son present or using written communication could be helpful, it is essential to ensure accurate and professional interpretation during medical appointments for effective communication. A certified interpreter would have the necessary skills and knowledge of medical terminology to facilitate clear understanding between the patient and healthcare provider.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Writing materials are the most appropriate way to communicate with a deaf patient since they can easily read and understand the information provided that way. Having her son interpret could lead to potential issues of privacy, while lip reading may not be effective for everyone who is deaf or hard-of-hearing. A certified interpreter would be ideal but might not always be readily available.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of meningoencephalitis, which is often caused by pathogens entering the central nervous system (CNS) through various routes. Given that cysts and trophozoites were found in the cerebrospinal fluid analysis, this suggests an amebic infection such as Naegleria fowleri or Acanthamoeba spp., which are commonly associated with water exposure. Among the options provided, the olfactory nerve (D) is a known route for these pathogens to enter the CNS after being inhaled through the nasal passages during activities like swimming.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The facial nerve is located near the nose and mouth, so it is the most likely entry point for the parasite given the symptoms of the patient. This boy has a fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and evidence of cysts and trophozoites in his cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which are all indicative of an amebic brain abscess caused by Naegleria fowleri. This parasite is commonly found in warm freshwater environments such as lakes or hot springs, where it can enter the body through the nose and travel to the brain via the olfactory nerve.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an opportunistic infection due to his AIDS status, such as fever, chills, sweating, and mild shortness of breath. Given the high risk for tuberculosis (TB) or other infectious diseases in immunocompromised patients like this one, it is crucial to prevent transmission to others while continuing evaluation. Therefore, placing masks on both patient and healthcare provider before further examination is the most appropriate next step.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is homeless and unable to afford his medication, so the most appropriate next step is to arrange a direct admission to the hospital. This will ensure he receives proper medical care for his symptoms of fever, chills, sweating, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough, which could be indicative of an opportunistic infection or other serious condition related to AIDS.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with increasing pain in the left foot, a cool and pulseless foot despite having a strong femoral pulse but weak popliteal pulse after femoral-popliteal bypass grafting surgery. This suggests an acute occlusion of the bypass graft or distal vessels. Doppler ultrasonography is noninvasive and can quickly assess blood flow in the lower extremity, making it the most appropriate initial diagnostic test to evaluate for possible graft failure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity can help to diagnose the presence of a blood clot, which is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. This non-invasive test will provide information about blood flow and identify any blockages in the arteries.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. After consuming a meal, glucose levels rise and insulin is released to promote glucose uptake into cells for energy or storage as glycogen. During fasting (12 hours in this case), the body maintains blood glucose levels through glycogenolysis, where stored glycogen in the liver is broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream. This process ensures a steady supply of glucose to meet energy demands when no food intake occurs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone that is released from adipose tissues and that helps to regulate appetite and energy expenditure. So leptin release from adipose tissues is the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration. The other options are not as plausible: continued gut absorption of calories would have ceased after 4-6 hours, skeletal muscle does not significantly contribute to blood glucose levels and glycogenolysis in the liver is a process that occurs when fasting or during exercise.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician is projecting her own feelings and frustrations about her son onto the patient, which indicates that she is experiencing countertransference. Countertransference occurs when a healthcare provider unconsciously transfers emotions related to personal experiences or relationships onto their patients.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's reaction to the patient is projection because she is projecting her own feelings of guilt and shame onto the patient. She is feeling guilty about her son's behavior and is projecting those feelings onto the patient. This causes her to react negatively towards the patient, blaming her for not taking care of herself.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with expressionless face, flexed posture, inability to open mouth wide, thickening and hardening of the skin over hands and forearms, mild kyphosis, slow gait, but normal muscle tension and strength testing. These symptoms are characteristic of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), a connective tissue disease that causes fibrosis and vascular abnormalities.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sarcopenia is a condition that is characterized by muscle loss and weakness. The patient is experiencing muscle loss and weakness, so sarcopenia is the most likely cause of her symptoms. Parkinson disease typically presents with tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability which are not mentioned in this case. Progressive supranuclear palsy usually involves problems with balance, movement, speech, swallowing, vision, mood changes, and behavioral changes, none of which is described here. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) can cause skin thickening but it also typically presents with Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, and other systemic symptoms not mentioned in this case.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, and a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash along with an elevated eosinophil count. These findings are suggestive of a parasitic infection affecting the gastrointestinal tract. The most appropriate test to diagnose such an infection would be microscopic examination of the stool, which can reveal the presence of parasites or their eggs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A KOH preparation can be used to identify fungi, which are a common cause of perianal rash. So a KOH preparation is the most likely test to yield an accurate diagnosis. The other options do not directly address the symptoms presented.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a pancreatic mass, liver metastases, encasement of the superior mesenteric artery, and a femoropopliteal venous clot. These findings suggest an advanced malignancy causing hypercoagulability, which is known to increase the risk of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The other options do not explain both the pancreatic mass and DVT.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a condition that can cause pancreatic cancer and liver metastases. The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer and liver metastases, so multiple endocrine neoplasia is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Carcinoid syndrome typically presents with flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing, which are not mentioned in this case. Hypercoagulability from advanced malignancy could explain the femoropopliteal venous clot but does not account for the pancreatic cancer or liver metastases. A splenic artery aneurysm would cause abdominal pain and possibly rupture, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw, triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing teeth. These symptoms are characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia, a condition often treated with anticonvulsant medications like carbamazepine as first-line therapy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Levetiracetam is a anti-convulsant medication, which is used to treat seizures. The patient is experiencing trigeminal neuralgia, which is a type of seizure, so levetiracetam is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. In this case, the best answer is Levetiracetam.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Intravenous drug use is a risk factor for infective endocarditis, which can cause heart murmurs due to valve damage. The Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) is associated with conditions that impair right ventricular filling, such as constrictive pericarditis or severe tricuspid regurgitation, which may occur secondary to infective endocarditis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a positive Kussmaul sign.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) is a sign of right-sided heart failure. The patient has a systolic heart murmur, which is a sign of left-sided heart failure, so a positive Kussmaul sign is an expected physical finding. This can be seen in conditions like infective endocarditis, which the patient's history of intravenous drug use puts her at risk for.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old boy with normal pubic hair development and hormone levels within the reference ranges, indicating typical male puberty progression. Bilateral fibroglandular masses beneath the nipple-areolar complex are consistent with gynecomastia, which can occur during adolescence due to transient imbalances in estrogen and testosterone levels. This is a normal part of development for many boys.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) is a condition that can cause gynecomastia. The patient has breast enlargement, so seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) is the most likely cause of his breast enlargement. This is because Klinefelter syndrome often presents with normal to high levels of estrogens and testosterone in males.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of recent antibiotic use, which is known to disrupt the normal gut flora and can lead to Clostridium difficile infection causing diarrhea. Additionally, Hektoen enteric agar is commonly used for isolating Salmonella and Shigella species but not typically associated with C. difficile or Giardia lamblia. Considering the clinical context and culture medium, Clostridium difficile is the most likely etiologic agent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Clostridium difficile is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The patient has been taking antibiotics, so Clostridium difficile is the most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea. Other options are less commonly associated with recent antibiotic use.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A 10 mm induration in a child with no known risk factors (such as close contact with TB patients) is considered positive for latent tuberculosis infection, but not necessarily active disease. Given the child's history of homelessness and potential exposure to various health risks, it would be prudent to rule out active TB before proceeding further.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A repeat PPD skin test is the most appropriate step at this time because it is possible that the initial test was not accurate. If the test is positive again, then further evaluation is warranted. The other options are less likely to be immediately necessary based on the information provided.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, and episodes of choking or gasping for breath during sleep, which are classic symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Polysomnography is the gold standard test to diagnose OSA as it monitors various physiological parameters during sleep. Therefore, polysomnography would be most likely to confirm the diagnosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A multiple sleep latency test is a test that measures how quickly a person falls asleep. The patient has excessive daytime sleepiness, so a multiple sleep latency test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis. However, polysomnography (choice C) would be more appropriate in this case because it can evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea, which could explain his symptoms of snoring and episodes of choking or gasping during sleep.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of meningitis, as indicated by headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light, and positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs. The CSF analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration, which are typical findings in bacterial meningitis. Gram-negative cocci found on the Gram stain further support this diagnosis. Among the options provided, ceftriaxone is an appropriate choice for empiric treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis caused by gram-negative organisms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative cocci. The patient has gram-negative cocci in her cerebrospinal fluid, so metronidazole is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Clindamycin and erythromycin are not typically used to treat gram-negative bacterial infections.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The purpose of selecting a comparison group with chest x-rays is to ensure that the detection and diagnosis of mesothelioma are consistent across both groups, minimizing any potential biases in identifying cases. This approach helps control for ascertainment bias, which occurs when there's a systematic difference between how cases and non-cases are identified or measured.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Addressing confounding is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays because it can help to control for other factors that may be associated with mesothelioma. For example, asbestos exposure may be more common among shipyard workers who have had chest x-rays. By including both groups in the study (those diagnosed and not diagnosed), researchers can better isolate the effect of asbestos exposure on mesothelioma risk.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has been marginally compliant with insulin and dietary regimens, leading to higher blood glucose levels at home (140-200 mg/dL). However, his hemoglobin A1c is 5.4%, which indicates better long-term glycemic control than the fingerstick readings suggest. Hemoglobin A1c reflects average blood glucose levels over approximately three months and may not be affected by short-term fluctuations or noncompliance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c is too large to be explained by other factors. So his hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated. This is because an HbA1c level of 5.4% corresponds to an average blood glucose concentration of approximately 97-103 mg/dL, which does not align with the patient's reported home fingerstick readings.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has chronic granulomatous disease, which makes him susceptible to infections caused by catalase-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus. The fine-needle aspirate shows gram-positive cocci in clusters that are catalase and coagulase positive, indicating S. aureus. Additionally, the mecA-positive result suggests methicillin resistance (MRSA). Vancomycin is an appropriate choice for treating MRSA infections.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that is effective against Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has Staphylococcus aureus, so ciprofloxacin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Penicillin G and rifampin are not as effective for this type of infection. Vancomycin could be used if there was resistance to other antibiotics, but since mecA-positive organisms were found, ciprofloxacin is the best choice.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of rheumatic fever, which can lead to mitral valve damage. Her symptoms include dyspnea and hemoptysis, along with an irregularly irregular pulse (possible atrial fibrillation), bilateral crackles in the lungs, and findings on chest x-ray consistent with left atrial enlargement and pulmonary venous engorgement. The presence of an opening snap followed by a low-pitched diastolic murmur at the third left intercostal space is characteristic of mitral stenosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of rheumatic fever and a cardiac murmur, so aortic valve stenosis is the most likely explanation for these findings. Aortic valve stenosis can cause left atrial enlargement due to increased pressure in the left ventricle, which leads to pulmonary venous engorgement and crackles at the lung bases. The irregularly irregular pulse suggests an arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation, which is common in aortic stenosis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, and metoprolol was initially administered to slow the heart rate. However, his pulse is still elevated after two hours. Digoxin is an appropriate choice for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation when beta-blockers are insufficient or contraindicated.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In this case, the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. Enalapril is a medication that can be used to treat hypertension, which is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. However, it does not directly control heart rate or rhythm. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic agent primarily used in ventricular arrhythmias and would not be the first choice here. Digoxin can help to slow down the heart rate by increasing vagal tone on the AV node, but it may take several hours for its effects to become evident. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that has already been administered with some success in reducing the patient's pulse and would be appropriate to continue or increase dosage.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has recurrent low back pain, normal vital signs and physical examination, and is overweight with a BMI of 37 kg/m2. Given the absence of red flags or abnormalities on physical examination, imaging studies like MRI (option B) or x-rays (option C) may not be necessary at this point. Weight loss has been shown to significantly reduce low back pain in overweight individuals by decreasing mechanical stress on the spine and improving overall health.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's back pain is likely due to a herniated disc, as it is recurrent and located in the lower back. An epidural injection of methylprednisolone can help reduce inflammation and pain associated with a herniated disc. However, before proceeding with invasive treatments, imaging studies should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Among the options provided, an MRI is more sensitive than x-rays for detecting soft tissue abnormalities such as herniated discs.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is young and has a palpable, firm, mobile mass in her breast without skin changes or axillary adenopathy. Fibroadenomas are common benign tumors in young women that present as well-circumscribed, mobile masses. While the family history of breast cancer raises concern for malignancy, fibroadenoma is still more likely given her age and clinical presentation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age and family history, along with the presence of a firm, mobile mass, suggest a more serious condition like intraductal papilloma, which is a benign tumor of the breast. However, given her mother's history of metastatic breast cancer at an early age, it raises concern for a genetic predisposition to breast cancer. The most likely diagnosis in this case would be fibroadenoma (A), as it is common in young women and presents with a firm, mobile mass.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is HIV positive, and breastfeeding can transmit the virus from mother to infant. Therefore, it would be important to counsel her about the risks associated with breastfeeding in this situation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Amniocentesis is a common test for detecting chromosomal abnormalities, but it can also be used to rule out congenital HIV infection. This is because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Therefore, an amniocentesis would provide valuable information about whether the fetus has been infected with HIV.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The mother is O, Rh-negative and the father is B, Rh-positive. This means there is a risk for Rh incompatibility between the fetus and the mother if fetal red blood cells enter the maternal circulation. Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIg) administration prevents the mother's immune system from forming antibodies against the Rh-positive fetal red blood cells, which could cause hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Rho(D) immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent the development of natural killer cells, which are a type of white blood cell that can attack foreign cells. In this case, since the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there's a risk for Rh incompatibility between the fetus and the mother. The administration of Rho(D) immune globulin helps prevent the formation of antibodies against the Rh factor (RhD), which could harm future pregnancies.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fever, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and cough, along with physical examination findings such as tachypnea and dullness over the right lower lung field on percussion. These symptoms suggest a pulmonary infection or aspiration pneumonia. The presence of opacification in the lower region of the right lung on chest x-ray further supports this diagnosis. Among the given options, aspiration is most likely to cause these findings due to the patient's difficulty swallowing and frailty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with emphysema, a chronic lung disease that causes shortness of breath and chest pain. Emphysema is characterized by the destruction of alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs. This leads to decreased gas exchange and can cause hypoxemia (low oxygen levels) and hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels). The dullness on percussion over the right lower lung field suggests a consolidation or collapse of that area, which is common in emphysema due to air trapping. Aspiration could also be considered given her difficulty swallowing, but it would not explain the chronic nature of her symptoms and arterial hypoxemia.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The neonate was born at 36 weeks, showing signs of respiratory difficulty with mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray findings include prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. These symptoms are consistent with transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN), which is common in infants born via cesarean delivery, especially when there's a history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Meconium aspiration syndrome can cause respiratory distress in newborns, and the patient's history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid suggests this diagnosis. Meconium aspiration syndrome is a condition that occurs when a baby breathes in meconium, which is a thick, tarry substance that is present in the amniotic fluid. This can cause blockage and inflammation of the airways, leading to respiratory distress. The chest x-ray findings also support this diagnosis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of HIV infection and presents with symptoms suggestive of cellulitis, likely due to her recent scrape injury. Given her allergies to erythromycin (a macrolide) and penicillin, the best choice would be an antibiotic that is effective against skin infections but does not belong to these classes. Clindamycin is a suitable option as it covers most gram-positive cocci including streptococci and staphylococci, which are common causes of cellulitis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Clarithromycin is in the same class of antibiotics as erythromycin, so it is possible that the patient could have a similar reaction to clarithromycin. However, clindamycin is a different class of antibiotic and is not known to cross-react with erythromycin. Given her history of anaphylactic response to penicillin, it's important to avoid beta-lactams like amoxicillin as well.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is emaciated, has a low BMI, irregular menses, and participates in high-intensity sports like gymnastics. These factors suggest that she may be experiencing energy deficiency due to excessive exercise and/or insufficient calorie intake, leading to hypothalamic dysfunction and amenorrhea. This condition is known as functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA), which falls under the category of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with hypothyroidism, a condition that can cause irregular periods. Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone, which is essential for many bodily functions, including menstruation. However, the most likely cause in this case is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (B), as indicated by her low body weight and BMI, irregular menses, and emaciated appearance. These symptoms suggest an energy deficit that can disrupt normal hormonal regulation of menstruation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing emotional distress, crying all the time and not getting out of bed despite having a low pain score (1-2). She has major depressive disorder which could be contributing to her current state. Assessing for suicidal ideation in this context would help determine if she poses any immediate risk to herself.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Oxycodone is a strong opioid pain reliever, and increasing the dosage may help to manage the patient's pain. However, it is important to consider the patient's other medical conditions, such as hypertension and major depressive disorder, before increasing the dosage. In this case, her reported pain level is low (1-2 on a 10-point scale), suggesting that her current oxycodone dose may be sufficient for managing her pain.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has sarcoidosis and is on glucocorticoid therapy, which can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to reduced blood supply caused by steroid use. This condition presents with pain in the legs that worsens with weight-bearing, as described by the patient.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Osteoporosis is a common condition in older adults that can cause bone pain and fractures. However, the patient's age and symptoms suggest a more specific diagnosis, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This condition occurs when blood flow to the hip joint is disrupted, leading to bone death and subsequent pain with weight-bearing activities. The use of glucocorticoids for sarcoidosis treatment increases the risk of developing this complication.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The most appropriate approach for confirming a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is through obtaining detailed information about the patient's symptoms and experiences related to the traumatic event. Asking the patient to provide a narrative with a detailed description of the incident and his symptoms will help in assessing the presence, severity, and duration of PTSD symptoms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Amobarbital is a barbiturate that can be used to reduce anxiety and improve recall, but it is not the best way to confirm the diagnosis of PTSD. The best way to confirm the diagnosis is to interview the patient and obtain a detailed history of the traumatic event and the patient's symptoms. This will help assess if they meet the criteria for PTSD. Therefore, asking the patient to provide a narrative with a detailed description of the incident and his symptoms (option B) would be the most appropriate approach.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a necrotizing wound, crepitant bullae, and gram-positive rods on Gram stain, which are characteristic of gas gangrene caused by Clostridium perfringens. This bacterium produces several virulence factors, but the most relevant one in this case is \u03b1-toxin (also known as phospholipase C), which causes tissue destruction and hemolysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with gas gangrene, which is caused by Clostridium perfringens. Clostridium perfringens produces a toxin called alpha-toxin, which is responsible for the tissue damage seen in gas gangrene. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), including lower abdominal pain, fever, malodorous vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. PID is commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The recommended treatment for PID includes intramuscular ceftriaxone to cover N. gonorrhoeae, along with oral doxycycline to target C. trachomatis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Oral azithromycin is a common antibiotic used for treating sexually transmitted infections, but it is not the best option for treating pelvic inflammatory disease. The best option for treating pelvic inflammatory disease is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. This combination covers both gonorrhea and chlamydia, which are common causes of the condition.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a deep sulcus on the left and posterior inferior lateral angle (PILA) on the right, indicating that the sacrum is rotated to the right side. Additionally, the lumbosacral junction springs freely on compression, suggesting no fixation or restriction in movement. These findings are consistent with a right-on-right sacral torsion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a left-on-left sacral torsion, which is a common type of sacral torsion. Sacral torsion is a condition in which the sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine, is rotated out of alignment. The deep sulcus on one side and posterior inferior lateral angle (PILA) on the opposite side are indicative of this type of misalignment. Additionally, the freely springing lumbosacral junction suggests that there isn't a significant restriction in movement at this joint.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with recurrent episodes of urticaria, which is a common manifestation of allergies or hypersensitivity reactions. Since there are no other abnormalities found in the history and physical examination, it would be most appropriate to manage her symptoms initially while considering further evaluation by an allergist if needed.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Urticaria can be caused by allergies, so referring the patient to an allergist may be a good idea. However, there are many other possible causes of urticaria, so it is important to rule out other causes before referring the patient to an allergist. In this case, since no abnormalities were found in the history and physical examination, treating the symptoms would provide immediate relief for the patient while further investigation can be done.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient developed an allergic reaction shortly after receiving the influenza vaccine, which is characterized by symptoms such as shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema. These are signs of a hypersensitivity response to one or more components in the vaccine. Inquiry about an egg allergy (A) could have identified potential allergic reactions since some influenza vaccines are produced using eggs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A heterophile agglutination test is a test for infectious mononucleosis, but it is not the best way to prevent this reaction. The best way to prevent this reaction is to inquire about an egg allergy, as the influenza virus vaccine is made with eggs. If she had an allergic reaction to eggs, then she could have a severe reaction to the flu shot.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient swallowed a 4-cm nail, which is unlikely to pass safely via normal peristalsis due to its size and potential for causing injury or obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) allows visualization of the upper GI tract and can be used to remove foreign bodies like a nail safely, avoiding more invasive procedures such as laparotomy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Open laparotomy and removal of the nail through a gastrotomy incision is a surgical procedure that can be used to remove foreign objects from the stomach, but it is not the best way to manage this situation. The best way to manage this situation is to remove the nail through endoscopic esophagogastroscopy. This method allows for visualization of the object and its removal without the need for a large surgical incision.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with anal pain, blood on toilet tissue, and tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area without systemic symptoms or opportunistic infections. These findings suggest a localized infection rather than viral reactivation (Acyclovir) or immune-mediated skin condition (Imiquimod). Given his history of anal intercourse, an STI such as gonorrhea or chlamydia could be considered; however, the presence of tender lesions and trace blood in stool is more indicative of a bacterial infection. Levofloxacin covers a broad range of bacteria but may not be specific enough for this case. Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria, which are commonly involved in anal and rectal infections.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, but it is not the best option for treating this patient's symptoms. The best option for treating this patient's symptoms is imiquimod, which is a topical medication that is used to treat anal warts. This patient has several tender fleshy lesions around the perianal area and engages in anal-receptive intercourse, both of which are risk factors for anal warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The child presents with respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and a barking cough which are characteristic of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). Croup is commonly caused by parainfluenza virus infection. Oral dexamethasone therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of symptoms in children with mild to moderate croup.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Intravenous aminophylline therapy is a medication that can be used to relax the airways, but it is not the best way to treat this patient's symptoms. The best way to treat this patient's symptoms is oral dexamethasone therapy, which is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation in the airways. This would be more effective than intravenous antibiotic therapy because there are no signs of bacterial infection present.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton, causing pain and stiffness in the spine. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis by promoting inflammation. Since conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulfasalazine, and other treatments have been ineffective for this patient, the next step would be to administer a drug that targets TNF-α.",D,"Let's reason step by step. IL-1 is a key inflammatory mediator that plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis, so it is a logical choice. However, TNFα has been shown to be more directly involved in the disease process and targeting this cytokine with biologic agents like infliximab or adalimumab has demonstrated significant efficacy in treating patients who have not responded to conventional therapies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor, which prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and also increases levels of bradykinin due to decreased degradation. Bradykinin can cause cough as a side effect. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for this patient's persistent nonproductive cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. ACE inhibitors decrease plasma renin activity and therefore decrease the formation of angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. This decrease in blood pressure could explain the cough. However, another effect of ACE inhibitors is that they prevent the breakdown of bradykinin, leading to increased serum concentrations. Bradykinin can cause bronchoconstriction and stimulate nerve endings, which may result in a persistent nonproductive cough.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a low-grade fever, nonproductive cough, and patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray, which are indicative of atypical pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia is commonly caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydophila pneumoniae, for which macrolides like erythromycin are the first line treatment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Amoxicillin is a first-line antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia, which is a likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings. Cefaclor is also used to treat respiratory tract infections but may not be as effective against all causative organisms. Ciprofloxacin is typically reserved for more severe cases or specific pathogens, while erythromycin can be used for atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Metformin is a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes that primarily works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity, leading to improved peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. This aligns with the changes observed in the patient's condition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin release from the pancreas and therefore increases the uptake and utilization of glucose in target tissues. This leads to decreased hepatic glucose output as well, making it an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The single nucleotide difference does not alter the amino acid at that locus, suggesting it is a silent mutation and likely has no effect on the FBN1 protein function. Additionally, this same change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, indicating it's relatively common in the general population. Therefore, it can be considered as a polymorphism rather than a disease-causing mutation or sequence variant of unknown significance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mother's genetic makeup shows the same single nucleotide change as the patient, but she does not show any clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the change is not a disease-causing mutation, but rather a polymorphism or a sequence variant of unknown significance. Given that it is found in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, this further supports its classification as a polymorphism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms described are related to anxiety and panic, which occur specifically before flying or examinations. These events trigger stress responses that can manifest as urinary frequency and incontinence. Since the patient has a history of similar milder symptoms during exams, it suggests an anxiety-related cause rather than a physical issue. The most appropriate next step would be to address her anxiety directly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms seem to be related to stress, as they begin a few days before she is going to fly and stop after she arrives at her destination. Therefore, avoiding any stressful activities that cause the problem might be a good solution. However, considering the context of flying and the fact that these symptoms also occur prior to examinations, it's more likely related to anxiety or panic disorder rather than just general stress.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid is crucial for neural tube development in early pregnancy, and its deficiency can lead to fetal anomalies such as spina bifida. Since the patient follows a vegetarian diet that may lack sufficient folate sources, supplementation prior to conception would be most beneficial in decreasing the risk of fetal anomalies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium supplementation is important for bone health and is often recommended during pregnancy. Therefore, it would be a logical choice to recommend calcium supplementation to decrease the risks of fetal anomalies. However, folic acid supplementation prior to conception has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the fetus.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient already has high blood pressure (hypertension). Decreased cardiac output, decreased pulse, and decreased stroke volume would all lead to a decrease in blood pressure rather than an increase. Increased peripheral vascular resistance, however, causes the arteries to narrow, which increases the force needed for blood to flow through them, thereby increasing blood pressure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Decreased stroke volume leads to decreased cardiac output, which in turn leads to decreased blood pressure. Therefore, it is not a logical choice to select this option. A decrease in pulse rate would also lead to lowered blood pressure as the heart beats less frequently. Increased peripheral vascular resistance can indeed increase blood pressure by narrowing the vessels and increasing the force needed for blood flow. However, since the patient already has high blood pressure (165/95 mm Hg), it is more likely that further increases in peripheral vascular resistance would be detrimental rather than beneficial.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of a localized infection near the fingernail, including pain, swelling, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, along with a fluctuant area suggesting an abscess formation. Incision and drainage is the most appropriate next step to relieve pressure and remove pus from the infected area.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Paronychia is a bacterial infection, and cefazolin is an antibiotic that is effective against many common bacteria that cause paronychia. The patient does not have systemic symptoms such as fever or chills, so outpatient management with oral antibiotics would be appropriate.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending to the back, which is characteristic of pancreatic involvement. Normal gallbladder ultrasonography and serum amylase within reference range rule out acute cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis. Diverticulitis typically presents with left lower quadrant pain rather than right upper abdomen. Herpes zoster can cause a band-like distribution of pain due to the dermatomal pattern, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back, are consistent with diverticulitis of the cecum. Acalculous cholecystitis would typically present with gallbladder inflammation and tenderness on physical examination. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis usually involves elevated serum amylase levels, which is not the case here. Herpes zoster presents as a painful rash in a dermatomal distribution rather than abdominal pain.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Combining nicotine patch therapy and bupropion increases the risk of seizures, as both medications can lower the seizure threshold. The patient has a history of childhood febrile seizures, which may indicate an increased susceptibility to seizures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both nicotine patches and bupropion therapy can have side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These side effects can lead to dehydration, which can potentially lead to renal insufficiency. Therefore, the greatest risk when combining these two treatments is renal insufficiency.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a long history of varying physical symptoms with no definitive causes found despite extensive diagnostic studies and consultations, along with dramatic descriptions and conflicting statements about her history. These characteristics align closely with somatic symptom disorder, which is characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the distressing symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with conversion disorder, as she has a history of varying physical symptoms without any definitive causes. She also gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms. However, the key detail here is that she has been hospitalized multiple times since age 18 years due to these unexplained symptoms. This pattern suggests a chronic condition where physical complaints are prominent without an identifiable medical cause, which aligns with somatic symptom disorder.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a long-standing tremor that worsened recently, which is not present at rest and occurs with movement. This presentation is consistent with Parkinson disease rather than an adverse effect of fluoxetine or increased alcohol consumption, as these would likely cause other symptoms or have different patterns of tremor. Bereavement reaction does not typically manifest with worsening tremor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's worsening tremor may be due to bereavement reaction, as she is grieving the death of her husband. Bereavement can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including tremors. While fluoxetine could potentially exacerbate tremors, it would not likely lead to a significant worsening in someone who has had mild tremors for most of their life. Early Parkinson's disease is less likely given the bilateral nature and absence at rest. Increased alcohol consumption may temporarily reduce tremor but would not cause a progressive worsening.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy, which could have caused bone marrow suppression leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). This is supported by the presence of easy bruising and multiple ecchymoses. A CT scan of the chest would be appropriate to assess for any recurrence or metastasis that might affect the bone marrow.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the abdomen can identify any potential causes of easy bruising, such as internal bleeding or organ damage. Therefore, it is a logical choice to order this test. However, given her history of lung cancer and radiation therapy, there may be concerns about recurrence or metastasis in the chest area that could also cause thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) leading to easy bruising.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Kiesselbach plexus, also known as Little's area, is a region on the anterior part of the nasal septum where several blood vessels converge and is the most common site for nosebleeds (epistaxis). Given that the bleeding originates from the septal mucosa of the right naris in this patient, it aligns with the location of the Kiesselbach plexus.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The anterior turbinate is located in the nasal cavity and is a common site of epistaxis. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. However, Kiesselbach plexus (option C) is also an important consideration as it is a highly vascular area on the septum where most anterior nosebleeds originate from. The ethmoid sinus and posterior nasal pharynx are less likely sources of epistaxis in this case.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a buzzing sensation, a loud murmur on auscultation, and a thrill adjacent to his scar from a previous gunshot wound. These symptoms are indicative of an abnormal connection between arteries and veins, which is characteristic of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). The presence of dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves further supports this diagnosis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur, and dilated varicose veins, are consistent with an occlusion of the superficial femoral artery. This condition can lead to collateral circulation development, causing abnormal connections between arteries and veins (arteriovenous fistula), which may explain the murmur and thrill on auscultation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Timolol is a beta-blocker used in glaucoma treatment, which can exacerbate respiratory symptoms and cause bronchoconstriction, especially in patients with preexisting lung conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from long-term smoking. The other options are less likely to induce shortness of breath.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Epinephrine is a beta-agonist that can cause bronchodilation, which can lead to shortness of breath. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. However, the other options are also glaucoma medications but do not have known side effects related to causing shortness of breath in patients with smoking history.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with multiple, non-tender lesions on the shaft of his penis that turn white upon application of acetic acid solution. This is a characteristic finding for genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Cryotherapy is an effective treatment option for external genital warts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including three nontender lesions on his penis, are consistent with genital herpes. Oral acyclovir therapy is the standard treatment for genital herpes. It helps to reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk ratio of 1.2 indicates a slight increase in the risk for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly compared to non-exercisers. However, since the 95% confidence interval (CI) ranges from 1.1 to 1.8 and does not include 1, this suggests that the observed effect is statistically significant.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk ratio of 1.2 indicates that the risk for hip fracture is 1.2 times higher in those who exercise regularly compared to those who do not. However, the 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8 suggests that the true effect size is likely between 1.1 and 1.8, which means that the risk for hip fracture is still increased in those who exercise regularly. Since the entire confidence interval lies above 1 (no decrease), we can conclude that there's a statistically significant overall increase in risk.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms of poor weight gain, irritability, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and a positive reducing substance test with negative glucose oxidase suggest galactosemia, an inborn error of metabolism where the body can't properly process galactose. This leads to accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in tissues like liver.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is a key intermediate in glycolysis, and its concentration is increased in conditions that increase glycolysis, such as exercise or hypoxia. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. However, the clinical presentation of poor weight gain, irritability, vomiting, jaundice, hepatomegaly, positive reducing substance test result in urine and negative glucose oxidase test result suggest galactosemia, which results from an accumulation of Galactose 1-phosphate due to a deficiency in the enzyme that converts it into UDP-galactose. Therefore, option B is most likely correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The burn pattern described, 'stocking and glove distribution', is highly suggestive of non-accidental injury (child abuse) rather than an accidental scald from hot water. In such cases, it is crucial to ensure the child's safety by involving appropriate authorities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The child's symptoms seem to indicate a severe allergic reaction, possibly due to a food allergy or insect bite. Intravenous steroids are often used to treat such reactions. However, the scenario described is more indicative of a burn injury rather than an allergic reaction. The most appropriate next step after initial treatment would be to contact child protective services (CPS) because leaving a young child unattended near hot water could indicate neglect.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The location of the anal mass below the dentate line suggests that it is likely an internal hemorrhoid or a malignancy such as squamous cell carcinoma, which commonly arises in this area. Lymphatic drainage from the lower rectum and anal canal above the pectinate line (dentate line) primarily goes to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Therefore, if the mass is malignant, it would be most appropriate to evaluate the superficial inguinal lymph nodes for possible metastasis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sacral lymph nodes are located near the anal mass, so they would be the first to receive any cancer cells that spread from the tumor. Additionally, cancers below the dentate line typically drain into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes; however, given the proximity of the sacral nodes and their role in draining this region, evaluating them for possible metastasis would be most appropriate.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, dry skin, brittle hair, cold intolerance, weight gain, and an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter). Additionally, the presence of a slow pulse rate (bradycardia) and prolonged relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex are consistent with hypothyroidism. Among the options provided, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease) is an autoimmune condition that commonly leads to hypothyroidism in older adults.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and an enlarged thyroid gland, are suggestive of a multinodular goiter, which is a common condition in older women. Additionally, the presence of cold intolerance, dry skin, brittle hair, and mild edema further supports this diagnosis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, tongue wasting and fasciculation, decreased deep tendon reflexes in the left lower extremity, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes in the left upper extremity. These symptoms suggest a combination of both upper motor neuron (UMN) signs (hyperreflexia) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs (fasciculations, tongue wasting). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the simultaneous involvement of UMNs and LMNs. The other options do not typically present with this combination of symptoms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, are consistent with Friedreich ataxia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. However, fasciculations (muscle twitches) and wasting of the tongue suggest involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons, which is characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The asymmetrical deep tendon reflex findings further support ALS. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of diffuse weakness, tingling in the extremities, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and decreased sensation to vibration and position, which are indicative of a neurological disorder affecting both motor and sensory functions. These clinical features suggest a deficiency in Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), as it is essential for the maintenance of myelin sheaths around nerves and its deficiency can lead to subacute combined degeneration, resulting in such neurological symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamine deficiency can cause neurological problems, such as weakness and tingling in the extremities, which are similar to the patient's symptoms. However, thiamine deficiency typically presents with more severe symptoms like Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or beriberi. Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) deficiency is known for causing neurological issues such as weakness and tingling in the extremities, along with decreased vibration and position sensation, which are more prominent in lower extremities than upper ones. This aligns closely with the patient's symptoms.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration, which is indicative of early pressure ulcer formation due to prolonged immobility from quadriplegia. Frequent turning helps relieve pressure on vulnerable areas like the sacrum, preventing further progression of pressure ulcers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's skin lesion appears to be a pressure ulcer, which is a common complication in patients who are immobile. Whirlpool therapy is often used to treat pressure ulcers. However, the most effective intervention for preventing and treating pressure ulcers is frequent turning of the patient to relieve pressure on vulnerable areas.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has persistent hypertension without any significant findings on physical examination or laboratory tests, including normal urinalysis and cardiac/renal ultrasonography. This suggests primary (essential) hypertension rather than secondary causes such as renal disease or endocrine disorders. An appropriate next step in management is lifestyle modification, which includes an exercise program and weight reduction to address her overweight status.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's hypertension could be due to an underlying hormonal imbalance, such as Cushing's syndrome, which would require testing for urine corticosteroid concentrations. However, the absence of other abnormalities and her being at a healthy percentile for height makes this less likely. The patient is overweight (95th percentile for weight), and hypertension can be associated with obesity in adolescents. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise and weight reduction are the first-line treatment for pediatric patients with elevated blood pressure due to excess weight.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The child has obstructive sleep apnea, which can cause daytime inattention and fatigue due to disrupted sleep patterns. Elevating the head of the bed may help alleviate mild cases of sleep apnea by reducing airway obstruction during sleep. This non-invasive approach is often recommended as an initial management strategy before considering more invasive options.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Elevating the head of the bed would help to reduce airway obstruction and improve the patient's sleep apnea. This is a non-invasive, first-line management approach for obstructive sleep apnea in children.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of otitis media and presents with fever, ear pain, displaced ear, edema behind the ear, and non-mobile tympanic membrane. These symptoms are indicative of an infection spread to the mastoid bone, which is characteristic of mastoiditis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including ear pain, fever, and dizziness, are consistent with labyrinthitis, which is a common cause of ear infections. However, the physical examination findings such as displacement of the left ear forward and laterally from the head, edema behind the left ear, and a red, non-mobile tympanic membrane suggest mastoiditis, an inflammation or infection of the mastoid bone located behind the outer ear. This condition is often caused by untreated otitis media (middle ear infection), which aligns with this patient's history.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a palpable solid thyroid nodule with normal TSH levels, which suggests the need for further evaluation to rule out malignancy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is considered the most appropriate next step in evaluating thyroid nodules as it can provide cytological information about the nature of the nodule.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the neck would provide more detailed images of the thyroid nodule and surrounding tissues, which could help to determine the nature of the nodule. However, it is not typically used as a first-line diagnostic tool for evaluating thyroid nodules due to radiation exposure and cost. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is considered the gold standard for initial evaluation of thyroid nodules because it can provide cytological information about the nodule, helping to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions with high accuracy. A radionuclide thyroid scan could help determine if the nodule is functioning (hot) or non-functioning (cold), but FNA biopsy provides more definitive diagnostic information.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including fever, muscle pain, swelling of lymph nodes, and the presence of black maculae (eschar), suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis. This bacterium produces toxins that interfere with cellular processes. The most effective antibiotic for this condition would target protein synthesis inhibition, which is accomplished through the disruption of ribosomal assembly.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a bacterial infection, and the antibiotic would likely interfere with bacterial protein synthesis. Ribosomes play a crucial role in this process, making option D (Ribosomal assembly) the most effective target for an antibiotic to treat such an infection.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in active labor with a fully effaced and dilated cervix, engaged fetal head, intact membranes, and normal fetal heart tones. However, she has weak contractions despite being at 39 weeks gestation. This scenario suggests hypotonic uterine dysfunction, where the uterus contracts inefficiently during labor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including irregular and weak contractions, are consistent with Braxton Hicks contractions, which are a normal part of pregnancy. However, the cervix is already 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated, indicating that labor has progressed significantly beyond what would be expected for Braxton Hicks contractions. The absence of obstructive factors on examination suggests hypotonic uterine dysfunction as the most likely diagnosis.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. Exophthalmos and inflammation of the periorbital tissue are characteristic signs of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder causing overactivity of the thyroid gland. An MRI in this case would likely show changes related to the eye muscles affected by the condition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including exophthalmos and goiter, could be due to lymphoma, which can affect the thyroid gland and surrounding tissues. However, these signs are more commonly associated with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder causing hyperthyroidism. In this case, MRI findings would likely show diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles (rectus muscles) due to inflammation and edema caused by Graves' ophthalmopathy.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In most jurisdictions, a 15-year-old is considered a minor and typically requires parental or guardian consent for medical treatment. However, exceptions exist when the minor is legally emancipated, which may be the case here as she has been living independently without her parents' support for over a year. The most appropriate step would be to assess whether she qualifies as an emancipated minor and if so, accept her consent as sufficient.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A court order is necessary to evaluate a minor if the minor does not consent to treatment, but in this case, the minor has consented to evaluation. The patient is 15 years old and can provide her own informed consent for medical care without parental involvement or court orders.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and hematemesis (blood in vomit), which could be indicative of a gastrointestinal issue or other systemic conditions. Given her age and the fact that she is sexually active as implied by being a pre-med student, it's crucial to rule out an ectopic pregnancy first due to its potential life-threatening nature. A urine pregnancy test would be the most appropriate initial test in this scenario.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A complete blood count would provide information about the patient's overall health, including her red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Given that she has vomited blood (hematemesis), it is important to assess for anemia or other abnormalities in her blood cells which could be contributing factors.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Inguinal hernias in infants are typically due to a patent processus vaginalis and can lead to complications such as strangulation or obstruction if left untreated. Although some small, asymptomatic hernias may close spontaneously, the presence of symptoms (intermittent swelling) in this case warrants surgical repair. Therefore, it is most appropriate to inform the parents that herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A hernia is a serious condition that can lead to complications, such as bowel obstruction or strangulation, so it is important to schedule herniorrhaphy as soon as possible. Waiting for the child to grow older may increase the risk of these complications occurring.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has active asthma symptoms, which have been managed with albuterol as needed for the past month. Given his history of atopic allergies and long-standing asthma, it is appropriate to initiate a daily corticosteroid inhaler to provide better control over inflammation and prevent exacerbations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the use of the albuterol inhaler would provide quick relief of the patient's symptoms, but it is not a long-term solution for managing asthma. Fexofenadine therapy may help with allergies, but there are no indications that his current exacerbation is due to an allergy flare-up. A chest x-ray would be useful if pneumonia or another lung condition was suspected, which doesn't seem likely given the patient's history and lack of fever/productive cough. The most appropriate management for this patient with increased asthma symptoms is to initiate a daily corticosteroid inhaler (D), as it will help control inflammation and prevent future exacerbations.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with rotatory vertigo, imbalance, decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness in the right ear, and vomiting during episodes. These symptoms are characteristic of Meniere's disease, which is an inner ear disorder that affects balance and hearing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss, are consistent with benign positional vertigo, which is a common cause of dizziness. However, the presence of decreased hearing, ear fullness, and recurrent episodes suggest Meniere's disease as the most likely diagnosis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of infection, including fever, chills, and an elevated leukocyte count. The presence of fluctuance at the burn sites indicates abscess formation. In this case, incision and drainage is necessary to treat the localized infection.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's injuries are severe and require specialized care, so he should be transferred to a burn center. This is because the presence of multiple burn sites with fluctuance indicates an abscess or necrotizing fasciitis that requires surgical intervention. Additionally, his history of self-mutilation suggests underlying psychiatric issues that need evaluation and management.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing chest pain radiating to his jaw, which suggests angina or a possible myocardial infarction (MI). An S4 heart sound indicates left ventricular hypertrophy and/or decreased compliance of the left ventricle, often seen in patients with coronary artery disease. Immediate treatment for chest pain due to MI typically involves nitroglycerin or other drugs that increase nitric oxide concentration (option B), which helps dilate blood vessels and improve blood flow to the heart muscle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a heart attack, and epinephrine is a drug that increases cAMP concentration and can help to improve heart function. Increasing nitric oxide would cause vasodilation which may not be the immediate priority in this case. Both potassium and sodium flux inhibitors could potentially worsen cardiac conditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a sore throat, fever, fatigue, cervical lymphadenopathy, and pharyngeal erythema with creamy exudate. These symptoms are characteristic of infectious mononucleosis, which is commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The recent unprotected sexual intercourse may have exposed him to EBV through oral contact.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The main symptom in this case is the high fever. He likely acquired the disease from his partner, which suggests that it is infectious. He is likely infected by a virus causing high fever. Among the options given, Infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) fits this description best as it commonly presents with sore throat, fatigue and cervical lymphadenopathy in sexually active teenagers.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has expressed her wishes clearly to not be intubated again, which is documented in an addendum to her advance directive. Despite her current condition of severe dyspnea and low oxygen saturation, she still insists on dying at home. Given the available options, arranging for a consultation with a home hospice team (option B) would be most appropriate as it respects the patient's wishes while providing necessary support to manage her symptoms in the comfort of her own home.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's worsening shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation indicate a need for increased respiratory support. A home continuous positive airway pressure machine could provide the necessary assistance and improve her oxygen levels, allowing her to remain comfortable at home. This aligns with her expressed wish not to be hospitalized or intubated again.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with new-onset, moderately severe morning headaches relieved by analgesics and blurring of optic disc margins bilaterally, which suggests increased intracranial pressure. A CT scan is the most appropriate next step to rule out any structural causes such as a mass lesion or hydrocephalus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally is a sign of papilledema, which can be caused by increased intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure can be caused by a brain tumor, which can cause seizures. Thus, an EEG is needed to assess for the presence of seizures. However, given that this patient has no history of headaches or other neurological symptoms besides blurred optic disc margins, it would be more appropriate to first rule out a brain tumor with imaging before considering an EEG.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The ampulla is a part of the fallopian tube, and when an ectopic pregnancy occurs here, it can rupture into surrounding structures. Among the given options, the pouch of Douglas (also known as the rectouterine pouch) is the lowest point in the peritoneal cavity where fluid from a ruptured fallopian tube would most likely accumulate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ectopic pregnancy is located in the ampulla, which is a part of the fallopian tube. Since the ampulla is directly connected to the uterine cavity, the fluid from the rupture will most likely flow directly into the uterine cavity due to the anatomical proximity. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statistical power of a study is the probability that it will correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false, i.e., detect an effect if there is one. In this case, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding no difference between Drug X and standard therapy (Type II error) as 10%. Therefore, the statistical power would be 1 - Type II error rate = 1 - 0.10 = 90%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The statistical power refers to the probability of finding a significant difference between the two drugs when there is a real difference. Since the probability of wrongly finding no difference is 10%, the power of the study must be 100% - 10% = 90%. Therefore, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study is 90%.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with acute onset word-finding difficulty, weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg, which are suggestive of a stroke. Given his history of atrial fibrillation, he is at high risk for an embolic stroke. A CT scan of the head would be the most appropriate next step to rule out hemorrhagic stroke before considering thrombolytic therapy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a neurological problem, such as a seizure. Therefore, an EEG would be the most appropriate next step to diagnose the cause of the seizure. An EEG measures electrical activity in the brain and can help identify abnormalities that may indicate epilepsy or other conditions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The technician is using a method that involves repetitive cycles of heating and cooling, which are characteristic of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR amplifies specific DNA sequences with the help of oligonucleotides, thermostable DNA polymerase, and nucleotides. The other options do not involve these steps or components.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Reverse transcription is a necessary step to convert RNA into cDNA before amplification. Then, PCR can be used to amplify the cDNA and detect the presence of CMV DNA. However, in this case, we are directly looking for DNA (not RNA), so reverse transcription isn't needed. Northern blotting is a technique used to study gene expression by detection of mRNA levels, which doesn't apply here as well. Southern blotting involves the transfer of DNA fragments from an agarose gel onto a membrane for further analysis, but it does not involve amplification or repetitive cycles of heating and cooling. The described procedure matches Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), which uses oligonucleotides specific to CMV DNA, thermostable DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and involves repetitive cycles of heating and cooling for amplification.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with loss of sensation over the right side of the face anterior to the ear, along the mandible and chin, as well as on the tongue. These areas are innervated by branches of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Specifically, the infraorbital branch supplies the cheek area, the mental branch supplies sensation to the lower lip and chin, and the lingual branch provides general sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The foramen ovale is the passageway through which the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve exits the skull.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The foramen spinosum is responsible for innervating the face and tongue, so a fracture affecting this location would likely cause the observed sensory loss. Additionally, the described skull fractures (orbit, zygomatic arch, infratemporal fossa) are consistent with damage to the area around the foramen spinosum.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of a bee sting, including lightheadedness and bilateral wheezing without urticaria or difficulty swallowing. Wheezing suggests bronchoconstriction, which is commonly treated with \u03b22-adrenergic agonists to relax the smooth muscles of the airways.",D,"Let's reason step by step. α1-adrenergic antagonists are used to treat allergic reactions because they block the effects of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Since the patient is experiencing symptoms of an allergic reaction, α1-adrenergic antagonists would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. However, in this case, we are looking for a drug that can relieve bronchospasm and wheezing caused by the allergic reaction to the bee sting. β2-adrenergic agonists (choice D) act on the smooth muscle of the airways causing relaxation and dilation, which would alleviate the patient's bilateral wheezing.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. For a new severe respiratory illness caused by a newly identified virus, the primary concern would be safety and avoiding potential risks associated with live vaccines. Killed (inactivated) vaccines eliminate the risk of reversion to virulence since they contain non-replicating virus particles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Killed vaccines are less likely to cause side effects than live vaccines. They are also more likely to generate mucosal immunity, which is important for protecting against respiratory infections. However, the most significant advantage of a killed vaccine over a live one is that it avoids the concern for reversion to virulence, meaning there's no risk of the weakened virus mutating back into its disease-causing form.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a traumatic diaphragmatic rupture, such as shortness of breath, abdominal pain, hypotension, decreased breath sounds at the left lung base, opacification on chest x-ray, and greenish fluid from the chest tube. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a laparotomy (D) for surgical repair of the diaphragmatic rupture.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the patient's symptoms and the findings on the chest X-ray, it is important to assess the extent of the lung injury and the potential for a pneumothorax. Therefore, a CT scan of the chest would be the most appropriate next step in management. This will provide detailed information about the lung injury and help guide further treatment.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The woman has a single gene deletion (carrier), and the man has two-gene deletions in trans, meaning one on each allele. When they have offspring, there is a 50% chance that an offspring will inherit the normal gene from both parents, a 25% chance of inheriting one normal gene and one deleted gene (carrier like the mother), and a 25% chance of inheriting two deleted genes. Therefore, the correct answer is 25%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The man has a two-gene deletion, which is recessive. Therefore, all offspring will inherit at least one of the two genes with the deletion from their father. This means that 75% of the offspring will have a two-gene deletion. However, since the woman only has a single gene deletion and it's in trans (one on each chromosome), there is a chance for some children to inherit one normal gene from her.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has been exposed to meningococcal meningitis through close contact with an infected individual, but she is currently asymptomatic. Prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for close contacts of patients with meningococcal disease to prevent secondary cases. Rifampin is the drug of choice for prophylaxis in this situation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is at risk of contracting meningitis from her teammate. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of meningitis, so it should be prescribed to the patient immediately. However, since she feels well and has no symptoms, prophylactic treatment with rifampin can also be considered as an alternative option to prevent infection.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a blank stare, flat facial expression, catatonia, rigidity, and hostility, which are characteristic symptoms of PCP intoxication. Diazepam typically causes sedation, methamphetamine leads to hyperactivity, and oxycodone is an opioid that would more likely cause respiratory depression.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of catatonia and hostility are consistent with opioid intoxication. Oxycodone is a commonly abused opioid, so it is the most likely drug that the patient ingested. Diazepam would cause sedation rather than agitation; methamphetamine could cause similar symptoms but is less common at parties; PCP typically causes hallucinations and dissociative effects.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is on furosemide, which can cause electrolyte imbalances leading to nausea and poor appetite. However, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study would be determining serum albumin concentration (C), as it helps assess nutritional status and may indicate malnutrition or protein-losing conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's poor appetite and weight loss could be due to underlying lung conditions, such as pneumonia or congestive heart failure. Therefore, a chest X-ray is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study to rule out these possibilities. It can provide valuable information about her cardiac status and potential respiratory issues.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a sudden onset of severe occipital headache and stiff neck, which are classic symptoms of meningeal irritation. There is no mention of other common migraine or cluster headache features such as unilateral pain, photophobia, or autonomic symptoms. Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a 'thunderclap' headache and may have focal neurological deficits, which are not present in this case.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of severe occipital headache and stiff neck are highly suggestive of meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges. Cluster headaches typically present with unilateral pain around the eye rather than an occipital headache. Migraines usually have a history of similar episodes and may include other symptoms like nausea or visual disturbances. Subarachnoid hemorrhage could cause severe headache, but it is less likely without focal neurologic findings or altered mental status.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with foot drop, which is a common symptom of peroneal nerve injury or compression. This nerve wraps around the fibular head near the knee. Given that there are no ligament injuries and the standing flexion test results are negative, it's unlikely to be related to femur deviation or sacral shear. A plantar flexed cuboid would not typically cause foot drop. Therefore, a posteriorly deviated fibular head is most likely causing peroneal nerve compression leading to foot drop.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The anteriorly deviated distal femur would likely result in difficulty with ankle dorsiflexion, which is necessary for normal gait. A plantar flexed cuboid could cause foot pain but not necessarily a lack of fluid motion or foot drop. An unilateral sacral shear may affect the entire lower extremity and pelvis alignment but would likely present with more widespread symptoms. The posteriorly deviated fibular head, however, can compress the peroneal nerve leading to weakness in dorsiflexion of the foot (foot drop) while maintaining intact knee ligaments.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with constant substernal chest pain, fever, tachycardia, and diffuse ST-segment elevation in all ECG leads. These symptoms are indicative of pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). Pericarditis can cause distant heart sounds due to fluid accumulation between the layers of the pericardium.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The location of the pain, along with the patient's history of chest pain and the ECG findings, suggests a possible aortic dissection. Aortic dissections typically present as severe substernal or back pain that is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. The diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads on the ECG further supports this diagnosis. Injury to the aortic intima can lead to an aortic dissection.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the heart rate increases to supply more oxygen and nutrients to working muscles. This leads to an increase in cardiac output (heart rate x stroke volume) and systolic blood pressure due to increased contractility of the heart. Pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) also increases as a result of higher systolic pressure. Total peripheral resistance typically decreases during exercise because of vasodilation in active muscles, allowing for greater blood flow. Therefore, compared to pre-exercise measurements, total peripheral resistance is most likely to be decreased.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With an increased heart rate, the time for ventricular filling is reduced, leading to a decrease in stroke volume. Pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure are likely to increase due to higher cardiac output during exercise. Total peripheral resistance typically decreases as blood vessels dilate to accommodate increased blood flow.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of odynophagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and hematemesis, which are concerning signs for esophagitis or other upper GI tract pathology. Given the patient's history of AIDS and low CD4 count, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections such as candidiasis (esophageal) or cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, since there are signs of potential upper GI bleeding (hematemesis, positive occult blood), an endoscopy with biopsy is necessary to evaluate the cause and rule out malignancy or other serious conditions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of odynophagia and gastroesophageal reflux are consistent with GERD, which is often treated with proton pump inhibitors. However, the presence of hematemesis and a positive stool occult blood test suggest upper gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to esophagitis or ulceration. Given his history of AIDS and low CD4 count, he is at increased risk for opportunistic infections such as candidiasis (esophageal thrush), which can cause similar symptoms but would not typically result in hematemesis. An upper endoscopy with biopsy will allow direct visualization of the esophagus and stomach, identification of potential sources of bleeding, and tissue sampling for further evaluation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, presents with symptoms such as fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath on exertion, and physical findings including jugular venous distension, crackles at lung bases, S3 gallop, and bilateral edema. These signs suggest heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, which is characterized by impaired contractility of the left ventricle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. An S3 gallop is a heart sound that is heard during the early diastole. This can be a sign of mitral valve prolapse, which is a condition in which the mitral valve leaflets do not close properly. However, this patient has symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure (fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath, jugular venous distention, crackles at lung bases), and these are more likely due to impaired contractility of the left ventricle following a myocardial infarction. This leads to decreased cardiac output and increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The validity of efficacy analysis can be questioned if the vaccine response wasn't the primary outcome measure for a specific subgroup, as this could lead to biased or non-generalizable results. In this case, post hoc analyses may not have been planned in advance and might lack statistical power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations, it is likely that the vaccine would have a greater impact on this group, leading to a statistically significant protection among African American subjects. This does not necessarily question the validity of efficacy analysis but rather highlights the potential effectiveness of the vaccine in a high-risk population.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is exhibiting behavioral changes and engaging in risky activities following her parents' separation, which suggests she may be using a defense mechanism to cope with the emotional distress caused by this event. 'Acting out' involves expressing unconscious feelings or thoughts through actions rather than words, often as a response to stressful situations. In this case, the patient's behavior aligns with acting out.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient uses other behaviors to displace her attention from her negative feelings about her parents' separation. She is acting out in a rebellious manner, engaging in risky sexual behavior and breaking rules at home and school. This suggests that she is using displacement as a defense mechanism.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The child presents with developmental delays, irritability, resistance to eye contact, hand flapping, and a large head circumference (macrocephaly). These symptoms are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other neurodevelopmental conditions. Given the family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities, as well as the child's own developmental delays, it is likely that there is a genetic component to his condition. Trinucleotide repeat expansions are known to cause certain hereditary neurological disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, which can present with similar symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Frameshift mutations are a type of genetic mutation that can cause developmental delays and other problems. These mutations result in the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the DNA sequence, altering the reading frame of the gene and leading to a non-functional protein. Given the patient's symptoms such as irritability, resistance to eye contact, hand flapping, delayed speech development, and family history of learning difficulties, these are indicative of Fragile X syndrome which is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of smoking, weight loss, and respiratory symptoms along with the presence of a large right lower lobe mass in the lungs. These factors are highly suggestive of lung cancer. Among the options provided, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer associated with smoking and presents as a mass on imaging.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a pleural mass suggest mesothelioma. The presence of a mass in the adrenal gland further supports this diagnosis, as mesothelioma can metastasize to the adrenal glands. Mesothelioma is also associated with calcifications on imaging studies.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of an air-fluid level in the chest x-ray suggests a mixture of blood and air, which is indicative of a hemopneumothorax. Partial collapse of the left lung further supports this diagnosis. Tension pneumothorax would typically cause mediastinal shift away from the affected side, but the question states that the mediastinum is in midline.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of air in the chest suggests a pneumothorax. The patient also has blood in the chest cavity, which means it is a hemopneumothorax. However, the mediastinum is in the midline, which means there is no tension. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Hemopneumothorax not under tension.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient received additional diazepam intravenously, which is a medication known to suppress the central nervous system and can depress respiratory drive. This could lead to shallow breathing and decreased oxygen saturation as observed in this case. While encephalitis or meningitis may cause seizures, they are less likely to directly result in acute respiratory insufficiency immediately after diazepam administration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a fever and experienced a seizure, which suggests an infection. The oxygen saturation is low and the patient appears cyanotic, which are common symptoms of encephalitis. Encephalitis can cause respiratory insufficiency due to inflammation affecting the brain's ability to control breathing.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), which is known to cause interstitial lung disease, leading to fibrosis and reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide. This aligns with the symptoms of progressive shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and crackles in both lower lung fields. The pulmonary function test results also support this diagnosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has scleroderma, which increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension and thromboembolism. She also has shortness of breath and a cough, which are symptoms of a pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the most likely finding on lung biopsy will be multiple thromboemboli. The other options (diffuse interstitial fibrosis, intra-alveolar exudates, necrotizing vasculitis) are less consistent with her clinical presentation and history.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms presented (confusion, nausea, vertigo) after a neck manipulation could indicate vertebral artery dissection or stroke due to excessive force applied during the treatment. Among the options provided, treating the neck in simultaneous hyperrotation and extension is most likely to cause such an injury.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient had neck pain and was treated with articulatory springing technique. The fact that the patient had osteoarthritis of the cervical spine indicates that the treatment caused the complications, as it could have exacerbated the underlying condition. Therefore, the physician may be found liable if the neck was previously treated for osteoarthritis of the cervical spine.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The study shows a slightly shorter mean time for resolution of symptoms in patients receiving the new drug compared to those receiving the placebo, with a p-value of 0.04 indicating statistical significance (p < 0.05). However, the difference between 6.4 and 6.7 days is minimal and may not have practical clinical importance for patients or physicians.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The p-value is less than 0.05, which means the result is statistically significant. This also means that the new drug is effective and clinically significant, since it has a faster resolution of symptoms compared to the placebo. However, considering the small difference in mean time (6.4 days vs 6.7 days), this improvement might not be considered as clinically meaningful or impactful for patients.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with severe, sharp pain in the right upper quadrant associated with vomiting but no fever or other symptoms like diarrhea, dysuria, or jaundice. These signs are suggestive of gallstones (cholelithiasis) causing biliary colic. Ultrasonography is a non-invasive and highly sensitive imaging modality for detecting gallstones in the gallbladder.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with gallstones, such as severe pain in the right upper quadrant and vomiting. An x-ray of the abdomen is the most appropriate next step to confirm the presence of gallstones. Ultrasonography could also be used but it's not listed among the options.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain relieved by defecation, and nocturnal symptoms absence, which are characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Among the options provided, none directly treat IBS; however, sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can help manage IBS-related symptoms by modulating gut motility and sensitivity. Therefore, it's the most appropriate choice given the context.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including chronic diarrhea and lower abdominal pain, are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome. Nefazodone, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is often used to treat IBS. It helps regulate the movement of stool through the intestines and can reduce symptoms like diarrhea.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The child has a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, which could have been inherited from one of his parents. Since the mother does not carry this translocation and is unwilling to cooperate in contacting the father for testing, it becomes crucial to obtain information about the father's genetic status. The most appropriate next step would be to attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father (Option A). This approach respects the mother's autonomy while still pursuing necessary medical information for the child.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's primary responsibility is to the patient, who is the child. Since the physician does not have a physician-patient relationship with the father and the mother is refusing to cooperate, the most appropriate next step is to document attempts to work with the mother and proceed no further. This respects both parents' autonomy while prioritizing the patient's best interests.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lowering the alpha level from 0.05 to 0.01 makes it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that we require stronger evidence for a result to be considered statistically significant. This does not increase power or decrease Type II errors; instead, it increases the likelihood of avoiding false positives (Type I errors). Therefore, any significant findings can be reported with greater confidence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Setting the alpha at 0.01 instead of 0.05 will make it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the study will have more power to detect a true difference between the two groups. Therefore, significant findings can be reported with greater confidence.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms consistent with bronchiolitis, which is commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV has a single-stranded RNA genome and uses its fusion protein to mediate cell entry. Therefore, the correct answer should describe these properties.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral respiratory infection. DNA viruses, such as adenoviruses, are often associated with respiratory infections. Double-stranded nucleic acid genomes include both DNA and RNA viruses, so this option is too broad. Mature virions lacking viral polymerase would not be able to replicate within the host cell, which contradicts the presence of an active infection. Viruses that mediate cell entry via a fusion protein are typically enveloped viruses like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), both of which can cause similar symptoms.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of severe infections and the current failure of neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus indicates that they are unable to effectively kill intracellular microorganisms, which is crucial for eliminating bacterial pathogens.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a problem with the movement of leukocytes. We know that the movement of leukocytes occurs via a process called rolling, which involves the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells. This is followed by firm adhesion and transmigration through the endothelium to reach the site of infection. The failure of neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus indicates that they are unable to kill intracellular microorganisms effectively, which suggests a defect in their ability to perform phagocytosis and subsequent killing mechanisms.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of a severe sore throat, fever, voice change, and difficulty swallowing, along with physical examination findings such as erythema, edema, displacement of the soft palate, uvula deviation, white exudate on tonsil, trismus, and tender cervical lymphadenopathy. These signs are indicative of a peritonsillar abscess (PTA), which is a complication of untreated or inadequately treated tonsillitis. The most appropriate management for PTA includes antibiotic therapy to treat the underlying infection and incision and drainage to relieve symptoms and prevent further complications.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has a peritonsillar abscess, which means that the treatment should be similar to the treatment of retropharyngeal abscess. Therefore, we should use intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. This is because it helps reduce inflammation and swelling in the throat area.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pheochromocytoma, a tumor that secretes catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These hormones are metabolized to vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in the body. Measuring urinary VMA levels can help confirm the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that a left adrenal mass could be a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor that secretes norepinephrine and epinephrine. This means that there will be an increase in sodium levels in the urine. Therefore, measuring vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), a metabolite of these catecholamines, would help establish this patient's diagnosis.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with sudden onset knee pain, warmth, erythema, and effusion without injury history. Positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy of synovial fluid are characteristic findings in pseudogout caused by calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD). Therefore, the most likely cause is deposition of calcium pyrophosphate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has a history of osteoarthritis. Ammonium urate crystals are often associated with gout, which can cause pain and swelling in the joints. Therefore, it is likely that the crystals found in the synovial fluid are ammonium urate. The other options (calcium oxalate, calcium pyrophosphate, and calcium urate) do not fit as well with the patient's history and symptoms.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of acute blood loss, likely due to esophageal varices rupture given his history of alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites. Immediate management should focus on stabilizing the patient and controlling bleeding. Endotracheal intubation is crucial in this scenario to protect the airway from aspiration, especially since the patient has become difficult to arouse.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has esophageal varices and is bleeding. The most appropriate immediate management for this patient is transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting, which will reduce the pressure in the portal vein and stop the bleeding. However, before any procedure can be done, it's crucial to secure the airway due to his altered mental status and ongoing blood loss.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which is a common symptom of endometrial pathology such as hyperplasia or cancer. Given her age and the irregularity in menstrual cycles along with heavy flow, an endometrial biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for potential malignancy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age and history of abnormal bleeding suggest the possibility of cervical cancer. Therefore, the next step should be a colposcopy to examine the cervix for any abnormalities. This procedure allows visualization of the cervix and collection of tissue samples if necessary.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that can induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, which are involved in drug metabolism. This induction leads to increased breakdown and clearance of certain substances from the body, including vitamin D. Therefore, supplementing with vitamin D is recommended to counteract this effect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine is known to cause osteoporosis, which can be worsened by low Vitamin D levels. Therefore, it is likely that the physician is recommending Vitamin D to counter the negative effects of carbamazepine on absorption. The most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, fever, and a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners, which are indicative of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Given the symptoms and risk factors, Chlamydia trachomatis is likely involved as it commonly causes pelvic inflammatory disease. Neisseria gonorrhoeae should also be considered due to its prevalence among young individuals with similar sexual behaviors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and cervical mucus, are consistent with syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. Therefore, antimicrobial chemotherapy should target this specific bacterium. The most appropriate answer is Chlamydia trachomatis and Treponema pallidum.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a legal obligation to disclose his diagnosis to his probation officer, as it may be relevant to his compliance with the terms of his probation and could impact public safety. Disclosing information to Cocaine Anonymous sponsor or wife would violate patient confidentiality without explicit consent. The insurance company is not entitled to this specific diagnosis unless required by law.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's wife is the one covering the insurance and is therefore entitled to know the diagnosis and treatment plan since she is responsible for the payment. However, it is crucial to respect the patient's wishes regarding privacy unless there are overriding legal or safety concerns that would require disclosure.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The child is showing symptoms of an allergic reaction, specifically to eggs. Some vaccines contain egg proteins and can cause hypersensitivity reactions in individuals with severe egg allergies. Among the options given, Influenza vaccine (Flu shot) often contains small amounts of egg protein as it is commonly produced using chicken eggs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hypersensitivity reactions are related to the liver and can be caused by vaccines that contain antigens from the liver, like the hepatitis vaccine. The symptoms described in the question (urticaria, swelling of lips, difficulty breathing) suggest an allergic reaction possibly triggered by a component present in one of these vaccines.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a history of recurrent injuries, joint hypermobility, and chest pain on exertion. These symptoms suggest a connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Given the family history of severe rotator cuff injury and ruptured aortic aneurysm, there is likely a genetic component to her condition. The most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be echocardiography to assess for cardiovascular abnormalities commonly associated with these disorders.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of recurrent injuries, joint hypermobility, and family history of connective tissue disorders is suggestive of a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In this case, a bone scan would be the most appropriate next step to assess for any underlying bone abnormalities. However, given her chest pain with exertion and swollen ankle, it's crucial to rule out cardiovascular complications such as aortic dissection or mitral valve prolapse that can be associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of a brown, irregular mass behind the tympanic membrane in a child with chronic recurrent otitis media suggests cholesteatoma, which is an abnormal growth of skin cells (epithelial tissue) in the middle ear. This condition often occurs as a result of repeated infections and can lead to hearing loss if not treated.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Midface hypoplasia is a condition that affects the development of the facial bones, which can cause a number of problems including difficulty breathing and eating. The findings in this case are consistent with midface hypoplasia, as the mass behind the tympanic membrane is likely a result of the underdeveloped facial bones. This condition would not be caused by epithelial tissue proliferation, lingual papillae loss, or middle ear effusion.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The infant has a history of enteritis and dehydration, is fed cow-milk formula, and presents with persistent watery diarrhea, dry mucous membranes, and slight abdominal distension. These symptoms are consistent with lactase deficiency, which can be transient in infants after a gastrointestinal illness like enteritis. The other options do not align as closely with the presented clinical picture.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fructose intolerance is a condition where the body cannot properly digest fructose, which can lead to watery diarrhea. The patient's symptoms are consistent with fructose intolerance, as he is experiencing watery diarrhea and has been consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, the other options (transient lactase deficiency, magnesium deficiency, and regional enteritis) do not align as closely with the symptoms described.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has an adrenal mass with elevated urinary normetanephrine, metanephrine, and plasma aldosterone concentrations, suggesting a pheochromocytoma or primary hyperaldosteronism. Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist used to control hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma before surgery by blocking the effects of catecholamines.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's elevated blood pressure and history of a right flank mass suggest that he may have a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that can cause hypertension. In this case, a loading dose of potassium chloride would be indicated to help prevent hypokalemia, which can be a complication of pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine is also used in the preoperative management of pheochromocytoma but it's not an initial treatment.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The study involves a group of children with chronic headaches who are all treated with acupuncture in addition to their usual therapy, without any comparison or control groups mentioned.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has chronic renal failure and a high serum creatinine concentration, indicating the need for long-term treatment options such as dialysis. Given her remote location from the nearest dialysis facility, it is crucial to consider whether she would be suitable for home dialysis, which could provide more convenience and accessibility.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of an abdominal operation, specifically a cholecystectomy, is likely the most relevant factor to consider in long-term treatment options as it may indicate potential complications or limitations related to the surgery. Her eligibility for Medicare and her arthritis are less directly related to the immediate decision regarding dialysis. The suitability for home dialysis would be a consideration, but given that she lives on a farm 90 miles from the nearest facility, it may not be feasible.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of hypocalcemia, such as cramping in hands and feet, numbness around the lips, tetany (indicated by positive Chvostek and Trousseau signs), and a low serum calcium concentration. Chronic alcoholism can lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies that affect parathyroid hormone function, causing hypocalcemia. Among the options provided, Hypoparathyroidism is most consistent with these findings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cramping, numbness, and tingling are consistent with hypomagnesemia, a condition characterized by low magnesium levels in the blood. Additionally, his history of alcohol abuse increases the risk for this electrolyte imbalance. Hypomagnesemia can also cause Chvostek and Trousseau signs, which are present in this patient. The other options do not fit as well with the clinical presentation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing exertional chest pain, which suggests stable angina due to coronary artery disease (CAD). β-adrenergic blocking agents are used in CAD because they decrease myocardial oxygen demand by reducing heart rate and contractility, thus improving symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is decreasing myocardial contractility.",A,"Let's reason step by step. β-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol, are known to cause peripheral vasodilation, which can reduce afterload and improve symptoms of angina. This is particularly beneficial for patients with exertional chest pain due to coronary artery disease, like the patient described in this scenario.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a history of low-grade fever, increasing abdominal cramps exacerbated by bowel movements, and no relief from antibiotics. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory process in the colon or rectum. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is the most appropriate next step as it can provide detailed images to help identify any potential sources of inflammation, such as diverticulitis or colitis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of antibiotic use and symptoms of abdominal cramps and fever suggest a potential Clostridium difficile infection, which is commonly associated with antibiotic use. Testing the stool for C. difficile toxin would be an appropriate next step to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, dry eyes and mouth (suggestive of Sjögren syndrome), weight loss, and a mass in the right hilum on x-ray. These findings are consistent with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), which is often associated with small cell lung cancer located at the right hilum. LEMS affects the presynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of leg weakness and difficulty rising from a chair are consistent with a muscle membrane disorder, such as myopathy, which can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. However, the presence of dry eyes and mouth suggests an involvement of the autonomic nervous system, specifically the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls salivation and lacrimation. The combination of these symptoms points to a lesion affecting the parasympathetic nervous system.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In this scenario, the physician believes that informing the patient's wife about his HIV status is crucial for her health and well-being. This action prioritizes beneficence (doing good) over autonomy (respecting the patient's right to make decisions), as it aims to protect the wife from potential harm by knowing her risk of being infected.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's recommendation is based on beneficence, which means that the patient should disclose his HIV status to his wife because it would benefit her by allowing her to take necessary precautions. This action overrides autonomy in this case as the potential harm to the wife outweighs the patient's right to privacy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The boy has cystic fibrosis, a condition that affects sweat glands and leads to impaired ability to regulate heat loss due to abnormal chloride transport. Given the high temperature, hot and dry skin, and lack of other symptoms related to adrenal insufficiency or infections, it is most likely that his condition has caused him to overheat without being able to sweat effectively.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, suggesting there is no active infection. Given his history of cystic fibrosis, the most likely cause for his current condition is related to the underlying disease and its impact on his body's ability to regulate temperature. Cystic fibrosis affects sweat glands, leading to impaired sweating and reduced heat loss. This would explain why he was found unconscious after playing outside in high temperatures.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Constricting the efferent arteriole increases resistance to blood flow, leading to an accumulation of blood in the glomerulus and consequently increasing the hydrostatic pressure within it. This increased pressure favors filtration across the glomerular capillaries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the efferent arteriole is constricted, there will be less blood flow out of the glomerulus, which means there will be less protein leaving the glomerulus. This will cause a decrease in oncotic pressure. However, this change does not directly affect Starling forces within the glomeruli.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with postprandial epigastric pain radiating to the right upper quadrant and scapula, which is characteristic of biliary colic due to gallstones (cholelithiasis). Given her symptoms and obesity, an abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant would be the most appropriate next step in management as it's a non-invasive, sensitive, and specific test for detecting gallstones.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including nausea, abdominal pain, and right upper quadrant involvement, suggest a potential issue with the gallbladder. A CT scan would be the most appropriate next step to visualize the gallbladder and identify any possible gallstones. Abdominal ultrasonography is also commonly used for this purpose but may not provide as detailed information.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of metastatic carcinoma to the bone and is experiencing midthoracic back pain. High-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) techniques may not be suitable due to potential fragility from cancer treatment. Indirect myofascial release can help alleviate pain without aggressive manipulation, making it a safer and more appropriate choice for this patient.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of cancer and has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, we would need to use a technique that is gentle and does not cause any further damage to the tissues. High velocity, low amplitude techniques are typically used for patients with acute injuries, so it's the most appropriate choice. Indirect myofascial release could be considered but may not provide as much relief in this case. Isotonic exercise therapy is more focused on strengthening muscles and improving range of motion rather than addressing pain directly. Mid velocity, mid amplitude techniques are typically used for chronic conditions that require a moderate level of force.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a jackhammer operator, which involves repetitive arm movements and can lead to venous stasis in the upper extremity. Symptoms of pain, swelling, erythema, and moderate edema are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis. Deep venous valvular insufficiency typically presents with chronic symptoms rather than acute onset. Axillary-subclavian venous thrombosis and superior vena cava syndrome would likely present with more severe symptoms, such as arm swelling extending to the chest or upper back.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and erythema are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis, which is a common condition affecting superficial veins. Given the location in the right arm and exacerbation by exertion, it suggests involvement of a superficial vein rather than deep venous or central venous issues. The basilic vein runs along the medial aspect of the upper limb, which aligns with the symptoms described.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, muscle aches, and generalized pain without any abnormal findings in her physical examination or laboratory tests. Given the lack of specificity for neuromuscular disorders (option A) and spinal pathology (option B), these options are less likely to be helpful next steps. Serum antinuclear antibody assay (option C) could indicate an autoimmune condition, but it's not supported by the patient's history or presentation. However, considering her age, osteoporosis diagnosis, and symptoms of diffuse muscle aches and fatigue, a deficiency in vitamin D is plausible as it can contribute to these nonspecific symptoms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, muscle aches, and generalized pain could be attributed to cervical spine issues, such as cervical spondylosis, which can cause similar symptoms. However, her physical examination is unremarkable for her age with no point tenderness on palpation. The patient's history of osteoporosis and the fact that she takes alendronate (a medication used to treat osteoporosis) suggest a possible vitamin D deficiency, which can contribute to musculoskeletal pain and fatigue. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D assay is an appropriate test for evaluating her symptoms in this context.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue along with multiple bilateral tender points in specific muscle groups. Normal radiograph findings and laboratory results rule out inflammatory or degenerative conditions like ankylosing spondylitis, myofascial pain syndrome, and osteoarthritis. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue, along with the normal radiograph findings, suggest osteoarthritis, a condition characterized by joint degeneration. However, the presence of multiple bilateral tender points in specific muscle groups is more indicative of fibromyalgia, which is known for widespread pain and tenderness without abnormal radiographic or laboratory findings.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of abdominal bloating, discomfort, and constipation that improve after bowel movements, suggesting a functional gastrointestinal issue rather than an inflammatory or infectious cause. Lubiprostone is indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults by increasing fluid secretion in the intestine to facilitate stool passage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis, which can be treated with mesalamine. However, the endoscopies show no abnormalities, ruling out this diagnosis. The symptoms worsen during stressful periods (exams) and improve after bowel movements, suggesting irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator used to treat constipation-predominant IBS.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with severe depression, insomnia, and auditory hallucinations (hearing voices). Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that can help manage the psychosis symptoms. However, for his major depressive disorder, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) like fluoxetine would be beneficial due to its efficacy in treating both mood and anxiety symptoms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, loss of interest, weight loss, and insomnia are consistent with bipolar disorder, which can be effectively treated with divalproex. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that may also help manage his psychosis (hearing voices). Divalproex has mood-stabilizing properties suitable for treating bipolar disorder and could complement the effects of olanzapine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, agitation, and hypotension (low blood pressure). These signs suggest a decrease in circulating volume leading to decreased perfusion. Additionally, the use of diuretics can exacerbate fluid loss. The low oxyhemoglobin saturation indicates poor tissue oxygenation due to reduced blood flow. Considering these factors, the most likely type of shock is hypovolemic.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, and hypotension, along with the low oxygen saturation, are consistent with cardiogenic shock, which is caused by a failure of the heart to pump effectively. However, his use of a diuretic could also contribute to dehydration and volume loss, leading to hypovolemic shock. The presence of cool extremities and delayed capillary refill further support this diagnosis as signs of decreased perfusion due to low blood volume.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise, which could be indicative of heart failure or valvular disease. Given the presence of a late systolic murmur heard at the right upper parasternal border, it is likely that this murmur represents mitral valve prolapse (MVP) or another form of valvular dysfunction. A transthoracic echocardiography would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the structure and function of the heart valves and chambers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue during exercise could be attributed to polymyalgia rheumatica, a condition that can cause similar symptoms and is often treated with prednisone. However, the presence of a late systolic murmur at the right upper parasternal border suggests valvular heart disease, possibly mitral valve prolapse or regurgitation. A transthoracic echocardiography would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate this finding and assess cardiac function.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient experiences fainting spells without warning, not associated with injury or changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or color during the episodes. Normal neurologic examination findings suggest that there is no underlying neurological cause for her symptoms. Vasodepressor syncope (orthostatic hypotension) typically presents with a drop in blood pressure and often has warning signs before fainting, which are not present here. Malingering involves the intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physical or psychological symptoms for personal gain, but there is no information suggesting this motive. Basilar migraine usually includes neurological deficits and aura, which were not reported in this case. Cardioinhibitory syncope involves changes in heart rate leading to fainting, which also does not match the patient's presentation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's fainting spells, with no change in heart rate, blood pressure, or color, are consistent with cardioinhibitory syncope, a condition caused by a sudden decrease in heart rate. This leads to reduced cerebral perfusion and subsequent loss of consciousness without other neurological symptoms.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a high school freshman and an athlete who has been experiencing fatigue, irritability, and concerns about his ability to continue on the track team. He also mentions lumps in his groin area. These symptoms could be related to hormonal changes during puberty or potentially sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Therefore, obtaining additional history regarding sexual activity would help determine if there is a potential risk for STIs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of tiredness, irritability, and sullen demeanor could be indicative of mood symptoms, such as depression, which can be associated with fatigue and changes in mood. However, the mention of lumps in his groin is a significant finding that warrants further investigation into potential causes related to sexual activity or other factors.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with severe epigastric pain and vomiting, along with elevated serum amylase and γ-glutamyltransferase levels, which are indicative of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pain is typically referred to the back via the thoracolumbar nerves (T8-L1). The closest option that includes T8-T10 is B: anterior rami of T6-T10.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, vomiting, elevated amylase levels, and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase levels are consistent with pancreatitis, a condition that can be caused by alcohol abuse. Pancreatic pain is typically referred to the back via the thoracolumbar nerves (T8-L1). The anterior rami of T6-T10 innervate this region.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a gynecological issue, such as lower abdominal pain and nausea, along with fever and leukorrhea at the cervical os. Given her sexual activity without contraception and recent menstrual period, pregnancy-related complications should be considered first. A serum β-hCG concentration test is a noninvasive initial diagnostic study to confirm or rule out pregnancy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and pelvic tenderness are consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease, which can be caused by sexually transmitted infections. A serum \u03b2-hCG concentration would help rule out pregnancy complications such as ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage that could present similarly.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with severe dyspnea, cough productive of brownish-yellow sputum, and a history of sandblasting and smoking, which are risk factors for silicosis. Silicosis is characterized by eggshell calcifications in the hilar lymph nodes seen on chest x-ray. The most appropriate intervention to improve oxygenation and relieve dyspnea would be continuous humidified oxygen.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and chest x-ray findings are consistent with asbestosis, a lung disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers. Asbestosis can lead to pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale (right heart failure), which is suggested by the presence of an S4 heart sound and clubbing. The most appropriate intervention in this case would be continuous humidified oxygen, which helps improve oxygenation and alleviate symptoms.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of sinusitis, including nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and tenderness over the maxillary sinus. Eustachian tube dysfunction can lead to fluid accumulation in the middle ear (clear fluid behind the tympanic membrane) and is often associated with upper respiratory tract infections like sinusitis. The other options are less likely: mucosal edema could be a result of inflammation but not the underlying mechanism, nasal polyps typically present with chronic symptoms rather than acute ones, and oral contraceptive use is not directly linked to sinusitis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and ear fullness are consistent with Eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be caused by inflammation or blockage of the Eustachian tube. This condition often leads to sinusitis due to impaired drainage of mucus from the sinuses.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms described, including recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, and salty sweat, are characteristic of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. In this case, a G551D mutation was detected in one allele of the CFTR gene. However, for an individual to exhibit symptoms of CF, both copies of the CFTR gene must be affected due to its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Therefore, it is likely that the second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of thick nasal secretions, salty sweat, and pancreatic insufficiency are consistent with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Since she has one detectable G551D mutation, it is likely that her clinical phenotype results from having only one functional allele of the CFTR gene and not being an obligate carrier or unrelated to the detected mutation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distention, and absent heart sounds after a stab wound to the chest. These signs are indicative of cardiac tamponade, which is an emergency condition where blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and impairing its function. The most appropriate next step in management for suspected cardiac tamponade is immediate decompression via pericardiocentesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased blood pressure are consistent with a bronchial injury, which can cause similar symptoms and require bronchoscopy for evaluation. However, the presence of jugular venous distention, absent heart sounds, and hypotension suggest cardiac tamponade due to penetrating trauma to the chest cavity. This is an emergency situation that requires immediate intervention.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of a surgical sponge in the patient's pelvis after a hysterectomy suggests negligence, as it is an event that typically does not occur without fault. This situation invokes the legal concept 'res ipsa loquitur', which means 'the thing speaks for itself'. It allows the court to infer negligence from the very nature of the accident or injury.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's case involves proximate cause, which refers to the direct and immediate cause of the injury, in this case, the surgical sponge left in her pelvis. However, the most appropriate term for a situation where an accident or injury occurs that would not have happened without negligence is 'res ipsa loquitur', meaning 'the thing speaks for itself'. This legal concept allows the plaintiff to establish negligence based on the nature of the incident.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms and history of swimming in a ship's pool suggest an exposure to hot tub or pool-associated bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This organism commonly infects the hair follicles after exposure to contaminated water, leading to folliculitis. Therefore, the most likely location for proliferation of this infectious agent is within the hair follicle.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of a red, itchy rash are consistent with eccrine gland involvement, as eccrine glands are the most common type of sweat gland and are responsible for sweating. They can become infected or inflamed due to exposure to contaminated water sources like swimming pools or hot tubs. The other options (Apocrine gland, Dermis, Hair follicle) do not typically cause such symptoms in the context of recent cruise travel and use of a ship's pool/hot tub.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus, and her hemoglobin A1c level indicates good glycemic control. She had a normal Pap smear three months ago, so human papillomavirus testing isn't necessary at this time. Mammography is typically recommended for women starting at age 40 unless there are specific risk factors present; her grandmother having breast cancer doesn't necessarily increase her immediate need for mammography.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's family history of breast cancer suggests a possible increased risk of breast cancer, and human papillomavirus testing is recommended for women with a family history of cervical cancer, as HPV is associated with cervical cancer. However, the patient had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago, indicating no current concern for cervical cancer. Dietary modification for weight loss isn't necessary since her BMI is within the healthy range (18.6-24.9). Mammography screening typically starts at age 40 unless there are significant risk factors or a strong family history of breast cancer, which doesn't seem to be the case here.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva along with a pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. These symptoms are characteristic of Chancroid, which is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of vulvar lesions, inguinal lymphadenitis, and fever are consistent with gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia trachomatis typically causes cervicitis or urethritis without ulceration. Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, which presents with painful genital ulcers but not commonly multiple satellite lesions. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A) can cause skin infections and cellulitis but does not typically present as described.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has AIDS and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which makes her susceptible to opportunistic infections. Her symptoms of progressive diarrhea and weight loss are consistent with an intestinal pathogen. Given her occupation as a flight attendant traveling regularly between the USA and Asia, exposure to Cryptosporidium parvum is more likely due to its prevalence in developing countries and resistance to chlorine disinfection commonly used in water treatment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, weight loss, and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count are consistent with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Cryptosporidium parvum could also cause diarrhea but is less likely given the patient's regular travel to Asia and her occupation as a flight attendant.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms described, including fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise, along with the isolation of a gram-positive rod from patients' respiratory tracts suggest an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. This bacterium is known to cause diphtheria, which can lead to serious complications such as myocardial involvement and respiratory issues.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, and swollen glands, which are all consistent with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. However, the presence of a gram-positive rod isolated from the respiratory tracts suggests a bacterial infection rather than a viral one. Among the options given, Corynebacterium diphtheriae is known to cause severe symptoms including sore throat and can lead to myocardial involvement or death due to its potent exotoxin.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of meningitis, indicated by fever, headache, and altered mental status. Elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along with pleocytosis suggest a bacterial cause rather than viral or other non-infectious etiologies. Among the options provided, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms and elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid suggest a bacterial meningitis, and Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of this condition. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae is more prevalent as an etiologic organism for bacterial meningitis in adults.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The primary concern of the parents is about their son's health and lifestyle choices, which they believe are increasing his risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. However, it's important to respect the autonomy and decision-making capacity of the patient before considering guardianship or other interventions. Therefore, initiating a family meeting would be an appropriate first step to discuss their concerns with him.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's Down syndrome and mild mental retardation raise concerns about his competency to make decisions regarding his health and lifestyle. Before considering guardianship, it is essential to evaluate the patient's ability to understand and manage his own affairs. Therefore, arranging for an evaluation of their son's competency would be the most appropriate initial recommendation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females, causing infertility due to underdeveloped ovaries. Since the patient is prepubescent and has expressed interest in having babies, it would be most appropriate to counsel her about alternative options for starting a family.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's Turner syndrome raises concerns about her ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy, so genetic counseling is the most appropriate next step. Genetic counselors can provide information on fertility options such as adoption or assisted reproductive technologies.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with progressive memory loss, repetition of herself frequently and forgetting to take her routine medications which are symptoms suggestive of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are commonly used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of memory loss and tremors suggest a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease, and dopamine agonists are commonly used to treat this condition. However, the Mini-Mental State Examination score indicates mild cognitive impairment which is more consistent with Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia rather than Parkinson's. Cholinesterase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's and other types of dementia by increasing the levels of acetylcholine, which is often deficient in these conditions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a grade 3/6 systolic murmur along the left sternal border, weak femoral pulses, radiofemoral delay, mild cardiomegaly, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. These findings suggest coarctation of the aorta (COA), which is characterized by narrowing of the aorta leading to increased pressure proximal to the obstruction and decreased pressure distally. Among the listed complications, systemic hypertension is most commonly associated with COA due to the increased resistance in blood flow.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's heart murmur and weak femoral pulses suggest a problem with the heart's electrical system, which could lead to atrial fibrillation. Additionally, left ventricular hypertrophy is often associated with increased risk of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Classic hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning it primarily affects males who inherit the affected X chromosome from their mothers. Since the fetus has a Y chromosome and is male (XY), he will not be a carrier of the disease but could potentially have hemophilia if his mother is a carrier. However, since we don't know whether the mother is a carrier or not, it would be incorrect to assign any risk percentage for the infant having hemophilia without further information.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hemophilia is a recessive X-linked trait, so the mother, who is a carrier, has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to her son, and the infant will not have hemophilia or be a carrier. The correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of increased anxiety, irritability, and difficulty concentrating following a traumatic event (robbery at knifepoint), which occurred 3 weeks ago. These symptoms are consistent with acute stress disorder, characterized by the development of severe anxiety, dissociation, and other symptoms that occur within one month after exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's anxiety, fear, and avoidance of certain situations suggest agoraphobia, a common anxiety disorder. However, the symptoms started after a traumatic event (robbery), which is more indicative of acute stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder usually involves excessive worry about multiple areas rather than specific triggers or events. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue and depression but would not explain her heightened anxiety, especially in response to loud noises.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The DtaP vaccine is used to protect against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). Contraindications for this vaccine include a history of severe allergic reaction after a previous dose or with any component of the vaccine. Previous seizures are not a contraindication unless they were directly attributed to a prior DtaP immunization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. DtaP immunization is a common vaccine that contains egg proteins, so it is important to ask about egg allergies before administering the vaccine. Apgar scores and gestational age at birth are not directly related to contraindications for this specific vaccine. Previous seizures may be relevant for some vaccines but not specifically for DtaP.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of alcohol odor on the physician's breath and appearance suggests possible intoxication, which could compromise patient safety. As a healthcare professional, it is essential to prioritize patient care and ensure that all staff members are fit for duty. Relieving the physician from his duties and alerting the hospital's patient safety officer would be the most appropriate action in this situation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's fatigue and disheveled appearance could be due to a long shift or personal stress, and it is important to allow him to rest and recover. However, the faint odor of alcohol on his breath raises concerns about potential impairment while treating patients. It would not be appropriate to let him continue working without addressing this issue. Offering to cover for him so he can sleep in his office is a compassionate approach that ensures patient safety and allows the physician time to rest.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of renal transplantation and is presenting with symptoms suggestive of an infection, along with elevated serum creatinine levels indicating possible kidney dysfunction. The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies on the biopsy suggests a viral infection. Given that he's receiving immunosuppressants (cyclosporine and corticosteroids), his risk for opportunistic infections is increased, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV) which commonly presents with intracellular inclusion bodies. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat CMV infections.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's elevated creatinine level and intracellular inclusion bodies suggest kidney transplant rejection, and increasing the dosage of corticosteroids is a common treatment for this condition. However, given that he has an infection indicated by fever, malaise, muscle/joint pain, and low leukocyte count (leukopenia), it's more likely to be caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection due to immunosuppression. The presence of intracellular inclusion bodies is also consistent with CMV infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to begin ganciclovir therapy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has palpable lymph nodes in her left groin, which are likely draining the area above them. Given their location just below the inguinal ligament and considering common sources of lymphadenopathy in this region, the most probable source would be an organ or tissue located in the lower abdomen.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The lymph nodes in the groin are typically associated with bone marrow involvement, so this is the most likely source of the lymphadenopathy. However, considering the location just below the inguinal ligament and the options provided, the vulva (option D) would be a more specific area that could cause localized lymph node enlargement in the left groin.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Ethics states that physicians should avoid relationships with former patients for at least 2 years after the termination of professional care, and even then, only if there is no exploitation or potential harm to the patient. In this case, since the student was involved in her care during a vulnerable period (major depressive disorder), it would be ethically inappropriate for him to date her.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ethical guidelines for physician-patient relationships state that physicians should avoid dating their former patients, even if a significant amount of time has passed since the patient-physician relationship ended. This is to prevent potential exploitation and maintain professional boundaries. In this case, as the woman was once his psychiatric patient, it would be inappropriate for him to date her.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated by the presence of leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and gram-negative rods on urinalysis during pregnancy. Oral amoxicillin is considered safe for use during pregnancy to treat UTIs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's urinary tract infection requires aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics to prevent complications. Intrauterine infections can lead to preterm labor, low birth weight, and other adverse outcomes for the fetus. Cefazolin is a first-line choice for empiric therapy of urinary tract infection during pregnancy due to its safety profile.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a bloody nose (epistaxis) and high blood pressure, which could be contributing to his condition. Initial management of epistaxis involves conservative measures such as pinching the nares together for 5 minutes while sitting upright. This helps in reducing the bleeding by applying direct pressure on the nasal vessels.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's nosebleed is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention, such as catheter balloon tamponade to stop the bleeding. Anterior packing and pinching the nares together for 5 minutes are less effective in this case due to the high blood pressure of the patient which may cause re-bleeding. Placing an ice compress over the nose is not a definitive treatment.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is unable to eat 6 days after surgery, indicating a need for alternative nutritional support. Central and peripheral hyperalimentation are typically used in cases of severe malnutrition or when the gastrointestinal tract cannot be utilized; however, this patient's primary issue seems to be postoperative ileus rather than overall malnourishment. Feeding through a nasogastric tube is an invasive procedure and may not be suitable for someone with recent abdominal surgery due to the risk of disrupting healing or causing complications. An oral fat-free modular diet would allow her to consume nutrients without overwhelming her digestive system, which aligns better with managing postoperative ileus.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's inability to eat after surgery suggests a severe condition that requires central hyperalimentation to provide adequate nutrition. Central hyperalimentation, also known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), delivers nutrients directly into the bloodstream through an intravenous line placed in a large vein near the heart. This method bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and is suitable for patients who cannot tolerate oral or enteral feeding due to prolonged ileus, ensuring they receive essential nutrients.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a pelvic fracture and blood at the urethral meatus, which are signs of potential urethral injury. Among the options given, the membranous portion of the urethra is most vulnerable to trauma from pelvic fractures due to its fixed position within the urogenital diaphragm.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The intramural (pre-prostatic) portion of the urethra is located within the prostate gland and is therefore at greatest risk for injury in this patient. This area is susceptible to damage due to its fixed position, making it vulnerable during pelvic trauma such as a motorcycle accident.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with recurrent respiratory infections, purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and infertility due to low sperm count. These symptoms suggest a chronic condition affecting the lungs and possibly other systems. Hyperinflation on chest x-ray and decreased FEV1:FVC ratio indicate obstructive lung disease. Among the options provided, cystic fibrosis is known for causing such pulmonary manifestations along with male infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD). A sweat chloride test is a diagnostic tool specifically used to confirm cystic fibrosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of frequent respiratory infections, decreased exercise tolerance, and wheezing suggest a respiratory condition that requires arterial blood gas analysis to assess oxygen levels. However, the presence of daily purulent sputum and low sperm count points towards cystic fibrosis (CF), which is characterized by thick mucus production affecting multiple organs including lungs and reproductive system. A sweat chloride test is a specific diagnostic tool for CF, as elevated levels of chloride in the sweat are indicative of this condition.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of claudication (pain in the calf when walking) and rest pain, which are indicative of peripheral artery disease (PAD). PAD is commonly caused by atherosclerosis leading to stenosis or occlusion of the arteries. The absence of pedal pulses suggests that the blockage is distal to the femoral artery, making Femoral popliteal stenosis the most likely diagnosis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of pain and cramping in the legs suggest vasculitis, a condition that affects the blood vessels and can cause inflammation and damage. However, the absence of pedal pulses indicates peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is common in patients with diabetes mellitus and smoking history. PAD often presents as claudication (cramping pain) when walking due to reduced blood flow to the legs. The most likely diagnosis, considering all factors, is femoral popliteal stenosis.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with recurrent, widespread blister formation that is most numerous in flexural areas and does not break easily without oral lesions. This clinical presentation suggests a condition called bullous pemphigoid, which involves the separation of the epidermis from the dermis due to autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomes at the basement membrane zone. Therefore, adhesion failure is most likely occurring in the basement membrane.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The blisters are located in the flexural areas, which are areas where the skin is more prone to friction and shearing forces, suggesting a problem with the dermal papillae. Dermal papillae contain structures that help anchor the epidermis to the underlying dermis; when these adhesions fail, blisters can form without breaking easily or affecting mucosal surfaces like the mouth.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has multiple risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), including a family history of early CAD, high cholesterol levels, obesity, and smoking. Among the options provided, smoking cessation is widely recognized as one of the most effective interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk. Therefore, initiating a smoking cessation program would be the most essential step in preventing CAD for this patient.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The high stress lifestyle, coupled with lack of physical activity and the consumption of fast food, leads to high cholesterol levels. Therefore, the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient would be to reduce stress levels by using a biofeedback-based stress reduction program. This will help her manage her lifestyle better and make healthier choices.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with confusion, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and elevated creatine kinase activity. These symptoms are consistent with Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening condition often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. The recent psychiatric consultation and prescription suggest that he may have started taking such medication, leading to NMS.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Amphetamines are stimulants that can cause agitation, confusion, and other symptoms similar to those described in the case. Since the patient has a history of drug use, amphetamine intoxication is the most likely explanation for his symptoms. The elevated temperature, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, profuse diaphoresis, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status are consistent with this diagnosis.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has Marfan syndrome, which is associated with connective tissue disorders and predisposes to aortic dissection due to weakened vessel walls. His symptoms of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the neck, described as tearing in quality, are characteristic of an aortic dissection. The presence of aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation further supports this diagnosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of Marfan syndrome and the presence of severe chest pain suggest acute bacterial endocarditis, which is a common complication of this syndrome. However, the tearing quality of the pain and its radiation to the neck are more indicative of an aortic dissection rather than endocarditis or myocardial infarction. Esophageal reflux with spasm typically presents as burning chest pain that worsens after eating.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has cystic fibrosis which can lead to malabsorption issues due to pancreatic insufficiency. This could result in deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, including A, D, E, and K. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors; its deficiency can lead to easy bruising and bleeding as seen in this patient. The other options are less likely given the history and presentation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of easy bruising and bleeding from the gums suggest a problem with blood clotting, which could be due to diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection. However, his history of cystic fibrosis is also important as it can lead to malabsorption issues including vitamins A, D, E, and K, all of which are essential for blood clotting. The absence of warmth or signs of trauma makes acquired factor VIII deficiency less likely. Hypocomplementemia typically presents with recurrent infections and autoimmune symptoms rather than bleeding issues.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with increased energy, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and a history of substance abuse but no psychiatric illness or physical examination findings to suggest another diagnosis. These symptoms are consistent with a manic episode, which is characteristic of bipolar disorder.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of alcohol and drug abuse, coupled with his current behavior at work, suggests a possible diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, which is characterized by a disregard for social norms and the rights of others. However, he has no history of psychiatric illness or impulsive behaviors that are typically associated with this condition. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) usually presents in childhood and is less likely to develop at age 32 without prior symptoms. Borderline personality disorder often involves unstable relationships, self-image, and affects, which the patient does not exhibit. The most fitting diagnosis based on his increased energy levels, decreased need for sleep, improved mood, and lack of psychiatric history is bipolar disorder.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The most likely precipitating factor for a malpractice suit is related to dissatisfaction with care or outcome, rather than socioeconomic status or physician's experience. Among the options given, perception of incompetence (A) and uncaring attitude (B) are more directly linked to patient satisfaction and potential legal action. However, decreased range of motion after surgery could be perceived as a result of poor technical skill rather than lack of care, making option A more likely.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's socioeconomic status can influence his perception of the physician's competence and care, leading to dissatisfaction and a potential lawsuit. However, it is not directly related to the specific issue at hand (the decreased range of motion). On the other hand, if the patient perceives that the physician lacks experience or appears uncaring during treatment, this could lead to feelings of mistrust and dissatisfaction with the outcome, making them more likely to file a malpractice suit. Among these options, perceptions about competence (A) and care (B) are most directly related to patient satisfaction and potential legal action.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing symptoms such as a pounding heart, poor sleep, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and excessive worry related to his recent job change. These symptoms are indicative of an adjustment disorder with anxious mood, which occurs in response to identifiable stressors (in this case, the new job) within 3 months of onset.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of poor sleep, restlessness, and inability to concentrate are consistent with major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate. However, the presence of a pounding heart suggests anxiety as well. Given that these symptoms started after a significant life change (relocation for a promotion), it is more likely an adjustment disorder with anxious mood rather than generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms of restlessness, combativeness, diminished breath sounds on the right side, and tachycardia suggest a possible issue with the chest tube placement or function. A STAT portable x-ray will help confirm this suspicion. If there is an issue with the positioning of the chest tube, repositioning it would be the most appropriate step to resolve these symptoms and ensure proper lung expansion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's restlessness and combative behavior are likely due to anxiety caused by the pneumothorax and the need for mechanical ventilation. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, can help reduce anxiety and improve the patient's comfort. However, it is essential to address the diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest, which may indicate an issue with the chest tube placement or function.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a slow pulse rate (40/min) with no apparent relation between the P waves and R waves on ECG, indicating dissociation between atrial and ventricular activity. This is characteristic of third-degree atrioventricular block, where there's complete failure of electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ECG findings show a P-wave rate that is faster than the R-wave rate, which is characteristic of second-degree atrioventricular block, type I. This means that not all P waves are conducted to the ventricles. Cannon A waves on physical examination also support this diagnosis as they occur when the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve due to delayed AV conduction.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with black nipple discharge, which is concerning for a possible underlying pathology such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or intraductal papilloma. Given the recent benign findings on mammography and ultrasonography, repeating these imaging studies may not provide additional information. Ductography can help visualize the breast ducts and identify any abnormalities causing the discharge.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of increased glandularity in the right breast and the black discharge from the nipple raise concerns about the possibility of cancer. Therefore, a repeat mammography is necessary to rule out any malignant changes. This will provide an updated image of the breast tissue for comparison with previous studies.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has heavy menses and an endometrial biopsy showing abundant mitotic figures, indicating a proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle where cells are actively dividing. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate cell cycle progression, including the transition from G1 to S phase during which DNA replication occurs and cells prepare for division.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lipid kinases are involved in cell signaling and play a role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, they are likely involved in the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. The other options (AMP-dependent kinases, cyclin-dependent kinases, and hexokinases) do not have a direct role in regulating cell progression during this specific phase.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of advanced cervical cancer, which is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV can lead to the development of cervical cancer through the insertion of viral promoters adjacent to cellular growth factor genes, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor formation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Specialized transduction is a process by which genetic material is transferred from one organism to another. This process can lead to the development of cancer, so it is possible that this is the pathogenesis of this patient's disease. However, inactivation of cellular p53 and insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes are also known mechanisms for carcinogenesis. Transactivation of cellular growth factor genes by TAX is a mechanism specific to HTLV-1 virus which causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, not squamous cell carcinoma.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with numbness and tingling in her right ring and small fingers, which are innervated by the ulnar nerve. Additionally, pain on palpation of the elbow and decreased sensation over the medial half of the ring finger and entire small finger further suggest an issue at the elbow level where the ulnar nerve is susceptible to entrapment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in the right hand are consistent with median nerve entrapment at the wrist, which is a common condition. However, the specific pattern of decreased sensation over the medial half of the ring finger and entire small finger suggests ulnar nerve involvement. The pain elicited by palpating the right elbow further supports this diagnosis as it indicates cubital tunnel syndrome, which is caused by entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, widely split S2 not varying with respiration, and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border are characteristic findings in atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD is associated with increased flow across the pulmonary valve due to left-to-right shunting of blood.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border is characteristic of aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aortic valve. However, the presence of a widely split S2 that does not vary with respiration and a soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border are more indicative of an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD causes increased flow across the pulmonary valve leading to splitting of S2, while the mid-diastolic murmur is due to increased flow across the tricuspid valve. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is an atrial septal defect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of left hemicolectomy at the splenic flexure, and her symptoms include hypotension, tachycardia, hypothermia, low urine output, and decreased hematocrit despite receiving IV fluids. These signs suggest ongoing blood loss or sequestration. The middle colic artery supplies the transverse colon near the splenic flexure; damage to this vessel during surgery could lead to postoperative bleeding in that area.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle colic artery supplies blood to the colon, so damage to this artery could lead to bleeding and a drop in blood pressure. Therefore, the middle colic artery is the most likely structure to be damaged in this case. This would explain the patient's symptoms of hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), hypothermia (low body temperature), and decreased urine output.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of recurrent infections, including Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marcescens, which suggests an immune deficiency. The negative nitroblue tetrazolium test indicates impaired phagocyte function, specifically the oxidative burst necessary for killing bacteria. This points to Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a condition characterized by defective NADPH oxidase in neutrophils and other phagocytes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches can lead to immune system defects, such as a lack of T cells or B cells. This could explain the patient's recurrent infections. The nitroblue tetrazolium test is used to assess neutrophil function by measuring their ability to produce reactive oxygen species during phagocytosis. A negative result indicates impaired oxidative metabolism, which would affect the immune response and lead to recurrent infections.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of renal calculus with calcium as the primary cation, and increased urinary calcium excretion. This suggests hypercalciuria, which is commonly treated using thiazide diuretics to reduce calcium excretion in the urine. Thiazides act by blocking Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symporters in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitors, such as thiazides, can help to reduce calcium excretion by increasing the reabsorption of calcium in the distal convoluted tubule. This makes them an appropriate choice for treating hypercalciuria and preventing recurrent renal calculi.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy, which is critical information for his care. Among the options provided, using rubber urethral catheters (D) poses the highest risk as they are commonly made from natural rubber and could trigger another allergic reaction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of latex allergy, so the use of rubber urethral catheters, which often contain latex, could trigger an allergic reaction. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid any medical equipment containing latex in this patient's care.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. A smaller sample size generally leads to less statistical power, which increases the likelihood of a Type II error (failing to detect an effect when one exists). The alpha value remains constant at 0.05, so the chance of a Type I error does not change. Power and sensitivity are related concepts that would also decrease with a smaller sample size.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A smaller sample size would increase the power of the study, since it would be easier to detect a significant difference between the two groups. However, this is not one of the options provided. The alpha value (probability of type I error) and beta value (probability of type II error) are set by the researcher and do not change with sample size. Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify positive results, which also does not directly relate to sample size in this context.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has normal female secondary sexual characteristics (breast development) but lacks pubic and axillary hair, which suggests a hormonal issue affecting the adrenal glands or sex chromosomes. Androgen insensitivity syndrome typically presents with male external genitalia due to resistance to male hormones, so it's not consistent with this patient's presentation. Ectodermal dysplasia primarily affects skin and hair development but would also likely impact other ectodermal structures like teeth and nails. A psychiatric disorder is unlikely given the physical findings. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can present with a lack of pubic/axillary hair due to impaired cortisol production, leading to an overproduction of androgens that may not be sufficient for typical male or female secondary sexual characteristics development.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's lack of menstruation and the absence of axillary or pubic hair suggest a possible hormonal imbalance or a developmental disorder. However, since she refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination, a psychiatric disorder, such as anorexia nervosa, could be the cause of her amenorrhea. The other options are less likely without further diagnostic information.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of mature-appearing lymphocytes, which are confirmed to be B-cell in origin. This presentation is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), characterized by the accumulation of functionally incompetent B cells and an increased risk for older adults.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a high leukocyte count and a high proportion of lymphocytes, which could be suggestive of acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, the patient's age and the mature-appearing lymphocytes suggest a chronic process. The immunohistochemical stains confirm that these are B cells in origin. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), which typically presents with an elevated white blood cell count and predominantly mature-appearing lymphocytes of B-cell origin.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, which is a classic sign of placenta previa. Additionally, her history of multiple deliveries and previous cesarean section increases the risk for this condition. Abruptio placentae typically causes abdominal pain and contractions, amniotic fluid embolism presents with sudden cardiovascular collapse, and latent phase labor is characterized by regular contractions without cervical dilation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of a previous cesarean section and current vaginal bleeding suggest abruptio placentae, a serious condition where the placenta prematurely detaches from the uterine wall. However, the lack of abdominal pain and the absence of contractions point towards another cause. The transverse lie presentation and blood on the vulva, introitus, and thighs are indicative of placenta previa, where the placenta covers the cervical os, leading to bleeding without labor or pain.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with cyclic mood changes that occur in relation to her menstrual cycle, including symptoms of both depression and hypomania (anxiousness, hyperactivity). This pattern is characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is not listed as an option. However, among the given choices, cyclothymic personality (C) best fits this cyclic mood pattern.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, hyperactivity, and insomnia are common features of generalized anxiety disorder. However, the cyclical nature of her symptoms, with the onset of depression coinciding with her menstrual cycle, suggests a different diagnosis. This pattern is characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is not listed as an option here. Among the given choices, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) best fits her symptoms and their timing.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a solitary, non-tender neck mass without systemic symptoms. Ultrasonography is typically the first imaging modality used to evaluate thyroid nodules due to its high sensitivity and specificity for detecting features suggestive of malignancy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An iodine131 scan is a good method for evaluating thyroid function and nodules, but it is not the best initial method because it involves exposure to radiation. Therefore, a less invasive method such as ultrasonography should be used first. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland can provide detailed images of the mass's size, location, composition (solid or cystic), and vascularity without any risk.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with rhabdomyolysis, indicated by the high serum creatine kinase activity and pigmented granular casts in urine. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute tubular necrosis due to myoglobinuria causing renal damage. The presence of opiates and cocaine suggests drug abuse, which could have contributed to the rhabdomyolysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of altered mental status and elevated creatine kinase levels are suggestive of cerebral edema, a potentially life-threatening condition. However, the presence of myoglobinuria suggests a different cause for the patient's symptoms. Myoglobinuria is often associated with rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to intratubular obstruction and direct cytotoxic effects of myoglobin on renal tubules. The patient's history of drug use may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis, putting her at increased risk for ATN.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which can lead to cervical spine involvement and atlanto-axial instability. This condition causes the first two vertebrae in the neck (the atlas and axis) to become unstable, potentially leading to transient episodes of weakness or paralysis due to compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots. The patient's drop attacks, characterized by sudden loss of strength and sensation in her legs, are consistent with this diagnosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of emotional distress and the occurrence of ""drop attacks"" during periods of high stress suggest that anxiety may be a contributing factor. However, the sudden onset and the presence of incontinence point towards a more neurological cause. Atlanto-axial instability is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis due to inflammation affecting the cervical spine's ligaments, leading to subluxations that can result in transient episodes of weakness and loss of sensation (drop attacks).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache without shortness of breath or fever. These are common signs of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI). Rhinovirus is the most common cause of URIs, while Mycoplasma pneumoniae typically causes atypical pneumonia with more systemic symptoms and Epstein-Barr virus usually presents as infectious mononucleosis. Allergic rhinitis could be a possibility but it's less likely due to the presence of sore throat, cough, and headache.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cough, sore throat, and headache are common features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. However, the lack of shortness of breath and the presence of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia suggest a different diagnosis. Rhinovirus is known to cause upper respiratory tract symptoms like those described by this patient.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with painful swelling over the sacral prominence, erythematous fluctuant mass and midline pores after a fall during wrestling. These symptoms are characteristic of pilonidal abscess, which is commonly seen in young adults who sit for prolonged periods or engage in activities that cause friction on the coccyx area.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of a painful, fluctuant mass with multiple openings are suggestive of hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic inflammatory condition of the apocrine glands. However, the location of the mass and the lack of involvement of the rectum point towards a different diagnosis. The history of trauma (fall during wrestling) is also significant in this case. A pilonidal abscess typically presents as an erythematous, fluctuant mass near the sacrum with possible midline openings and can be associated with low-grade fever.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The husband presents with gynecomastia, small firm testicles, lack of sperm in semen analysis and tall stature which are suggestive features of Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). This is a genetic condition that affects males, causing hypogonadism and infertility. The most appropriate next step to confirm this diagnosis would be karyotyping from peripheral leukocytes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of gynecomastia and small testicles are suggestive of elevated prolactin levels. However, the absence of sperm on semen analysis suggests a different cause for the infertility. Karyotyping from peripheral leukocytes can help identify chromosomal abnormalities such as Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY), which is characterized by small testicles and absence of sperm due to impaired spermatogenesis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in Tanner stage 5, indicating that she has reached full sexual maturity with normal hormonal changes associated with puberty. Acne during this period is commonly caused by increased androgen stimulation of the sebaceous glands leading to excessive oil production and clogged pores.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's acne is likely due to hormonal changes associated with puberty, which could involve increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone. However, the presence of acne in conjunction with the development of secondary sexual characteristics suggests a different underlying cause. Increased estrogen stimulation is not typically associated with acne. Increased sympathetic stimulation does not directly affect sebaceous gland activity. The most likely explanation for this patient's acne, given her age and physical examination findings, is the increased production of androgens during puberty, which are known to stimulate the sebaceous glands.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms of sinusitis, including facial pain, nasal congestion, purulent discharge, and fever. Among the options provided, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of bacterial sinusitis in adults.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of sinusitis and facial pain are suggestive of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, a common cause of bacterial sinusitis. However, the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms suggest a different diagnosis. Moraxella catarrhalis is another common cause of sinusitis but less likely than Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is more prevalent in adults with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient wakes up early at night and has no difficulty falling asleep, which suggests that his insomnia is not due to anxiety or depression (which would be treated with medications like sertraline). His physical activity level seems appropriate for his age, so a vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen may actually disrupt sleep. Snacking and reading in bed could potentially stimulate the mind rather than relax it before sleep. However, consuming alcohol can interfere with sleep patterns, particularly by causing early awakenings during the second half of the night when its sedative effects wear off.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Reading and snacking in bed can help promote relaxation and sleepiness. However, the patient's insomnia is likely due to a different cause, and these activities may not be effective in addressing the underlying issue. A vigorous pre-bedtime exercise regimen could potentially disrupt his ability to fall asleep by increasing alertness before bedtime. Sertraline, an antidepressant, would only be appropriate if there were signs of depression or anxiety contributing to insomnia, which are not present in this case. Alcohol can interfere with sleep quality and is known to cause early awakenings during the night due to its effects on the sleep cycle.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion, which are common symptoms of asthma. Additionally, her sister has asthma, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition. Spirometry results show normal lung function (FEV1:FVC ratio of 90%), but this does not rule out asthma as it can be within the normal range during symptom-free periods.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cough and nasal congestion are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease, a common condition that can cause these symptoms. However, the exercise-induced nature of the symptoms and the absence of chest pain suggest a different diagnosis. Asthma is characterized by reversible airway obstruction, which would be reflected in spirometry results showing an FEV1:FVC ratio less than 70%. In this case, the patient's spirometry results are normal (FEV1:FVC ratio of 90%), ruling out asthma. Chronic bronchitis and postnasal drip syndrome are also unlikely given her age, lack of smoking history, and absence of other supporting symptoms.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal issue, which is primarily innervated by the sympathetic nervous system originating from the thoracolumbar region (T7-L2). This area of the spine provides sympathetic innervation to the viscera involved in digestion and bowel movements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sympathetic nervous system plays a role in the regulation of the digestive system, and the C1-C2 spinal segments are involved in the autonomic nervous system. However, the specific innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from a different spinal level. The T7-L2 spinal segments provide sympathetic innervation to the abdominal and pelvic organs, including those responsible for bowel movements.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient was treated with rabbit antithymocyte globulin, which is known to cause a serum sickness-like reaction due to immune complex formation and deposition in tissues. This can lead to symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on hands and feet.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Natural killer cells play a role in the immune response and can secrete cytokines that can cause symptoms such as fever and arthralgias. However, the patient's symptoms are more likely caused by a different mechanism. Eosinophil degranulation is associated with allergic reactions or parasitic infections but does not typically present with lymphadenopathy. Immune complex deposition can cause fever and arthralgias, but it's less likely to be the primary mechanism here. Polyclonal T-lymphocyte activation is a common side effect of antithymocyte globulin treatment, which could lead to symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has had a painless left scrotal mass since childhood, which transilluminates and does not contain bowel sounds. These characteristics are consistent with a hydrocele, caused by the persistence of a patent processus vaginalis allowing fluid to accumulate in the scrotum.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's scrotal mass is soft and nontender, which could be suggestive of accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue. However, the mass transilluminates, which is not a typical feature of adipose tissue. Cryptorchidism would present with an absent testis in the scrotum rather than a mass. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus (varicocele) usually presents as a 'bag of worms' and can be painful, which is not consistent with this case. The most likely cause given these findings is persistence of a patent processus vaginalis, leading to an indirect inguinal hernia that transilluminates.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with fever, headache, seizure, and neurological symptoms such as confusion, memory deficits, and hyperreflexia. MRI findings of bitemporal hyperintensities suggest encephalitis rather than meningitis or intoxication. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis with such clinical presentation and imaging findings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and altered mental status are suggestive of bacterial meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges. However, the presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI and the cerebrospinal fluid findings point towards a different diagnosis. Herpes simplex encephalitis is characterized by fever, seizures, altered mental status, focal neurologic deficits (such as diffuse hyperreflexia), and characteristic bitemporal MRI changes. The cerebrospinal fluid findings are also consistent with viral meningitis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with irregular menses, amenorrhea, weight gain, acne, hirsutism (male pattern hair growth), and enlarged uterus and ovaries. These symptoms are characteristic of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of irregular menses, acne, and hirsutism are suggestive of an androgen-producing ovarian tumor, a rare condition that can cause these symptoms. However, the absence of other clinical features and the family history suggest a different diagnosis. Cushing syndrome typically presents with central obesity, moon facies, and purple striae, which are not mentioned in this case. Hypothyroidism usually causes menstrual irregularities but is less likely to cause hirsutism or acne. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) presents with a combination of symptoms such as weight gain, hirsutism, acne, and menstrual irregularity, which aligns well with the patient's presentation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a copious, foul-smelling vaginal discharge and heavy bleeding that has progressed over the past 6 months. A friable cervix with an exophytic mass suggests a possible neoplastic process such as cervical cancer. While hypertension, obesity, and age are important factors to consider in overall health management, they do not directly impact the immediate treatment plan for this patient's likely condition. The stage of disease is crucial because it determines the appropriate intervention strategy (e.g., surgery, radiation therapy) and prognosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age is a factor to consider in the management plan, but the stage of the disease is more critical in determining the appropriate course of action. Given her symptoms and findings on examination (foul-smelling discharge, heavy bleeding, friable cervix with an exophytic mass), it's likely that she has a significant gynecological condition such as cervical cancer or precancerous lesions. The stage of the disease will dictate treatment options and prognosis.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a syncopal event and a systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, radiating into the neck. These findings are characteristic of aortic stenosis, which can cause syncope due to reduced cardiac output during exertion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's syncopal event and the presence of a systolic murmur suggest aortic insufficiency, a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly. However, the location of the murmur and the radiation into the neck point towards a different diagnosis. Aortic stenosis is characterized by a grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border with radiation to the carotids (neck), which aligns with the patient's presentation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness in her left thigh, which is not associated with any skin abnormalities or muscle weakness. This localized symptom suggests nerve compression rather than systemic issues like cerebral infarction (A) or hematoma (D). The IVC filter placement could potentially cause complications, but these would likely present differently and not be limited to a specific area of sensory loss.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's recent history of cerebral infarction suggests a possible neurological complication, which could explain the tingling sensation. However, her vital signs are normal and she has no other neurological symptoms. IVC filter placement can cause complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism but is less likely to directly affect nerve function in the thigh. A hematoma could compress nearby structures, including nerves; however, it was resolving and she reported improvement over time. The most likely explanation for her symptoms is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (meralgia paresthetica), which can cause tingling and numbness in a specific area on the thigh.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms described, including high fever, strawberry tongue, erythematous rash, and edema of hands and feet, are characteristic of Kawasaki disease. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is the standard treatment for Kawasaki disease to prevent coronary artery complications.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a bacterial infection, and penicillin is the preferred antibiotic for such conditions. Intravenous penicillin can help prevent complications associated with this illness.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis, which are symptoms of a stroke affecting the left side of her brain. Stroke can lead to neurogenic bladder dysfunction due to disruption in neural control over urinary function. Among the options given, reflex neurogenic bladder is most likely because it occurs when there's damage to the spinal cord or brain that interrupts communication between the nervous system and the bladder, leading to involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's urinary incontinence is likely due to a reflex response to the neurological deficit, as the bladder is unable to contract appropriately. Given her symptoms of aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis, it suggests a central nervous system issue affecting both motor function and autonomic control over the bladder. The most likely diagnosis in this case would be reflex neurogenic bladder.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) is calculated as the difference in event rates between two groups. In this case, we have 5 out of 50 patients vomiting with azithromycin and 15 out of 50 with erythromycin. The event rate for azithromycin is 5/50 = 0.1, and for erythromycin it's 15/50 = 0.3. Therefore, the ARR is 0.3 - 0.1 = 0.2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute risk reduction is the difference between the two groups' rates, which in this case is 15% - 5% = 10%. Therefore, the best answer representing the absolute risk reduction for vomiting among patients in the azithromycin group is 0.1.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The symptoms and gram stain results suggest a Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, which is known for its ability to evade the immune system through antigenic variation. This allows it to change surface proteins and avoid recognition by previously generated antibodies, leading to reinfections.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The recurrent urethritis suggests an impaired immune response, possibly due to the inhibition of B-lymphocyte function, leading to a reduced antibody production. This would allow for repeated reinfections with the same pathogen.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with symptoms that improve after consuming orange juice or soft drinks, indicating hypoglycemia as a possible cause. Given the low serum glucose concentration and improvement following intravenous glucose administration, measuring serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations can help determine if there is an excessive production of insulin causing the hypoglycemic episodes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including nervousness, dizziness, and low blood sugar, suggest a possible cortisol deficiency, which can be further investigated by measuring serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations. This will help determine if the adrenal glands are producing enough cortisol in response to stress.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with pain after chopping wood, which involves external rotation of the shoulder against resistance. This suggests involvement of a rotator cuff muscle. Among the options given, both teres minor and infraspinatus are involved in external rotation. However, since the question specifically asks for another tendon besides teres minor that is likely inflamed, we can deduce that it's most likely the infraspinatus tendon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest an injury to the supraspinatus tendon, which is a common site for rotator cuff tears and can cause pain with external rotation. Inflammation of this tendon would be consistent with the described mechanism of injury (chopping wood) and clinical findings.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The tongue is primarily drained by the submental and submandibular lymph nodes, with deeper structures being drained by the deep cervical chain of lymph nodes. Given that the mass is located on the apex (tip) of the tongue, it's most likely to first drain into the submental lymph nodes before progressing further.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes are located in the back of the throat and are likely the first to be affected by metastasis from tongue cancer due to their proximity. Therefore, evaluating these lymph nodes would provide valuable information about potential spread.",C
