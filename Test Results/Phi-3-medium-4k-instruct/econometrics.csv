B,"Let's reason step by step. Negative autocorrelation occurs when a positive error at one point is likely followed by a negative error, and vice versa. This results in an alternating pattern of residuals around the regression line.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Negative residual autocorrelation implies the absence of any discernible patterns in the residuals, indicating they are essentially random.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The Dickey-Fuller test is used to test the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in an autoregressive model, which implies non-stationarity of the time series data. A more negative test statistic indicates stronger evidence against the presence of a unit root (i.e., towards stationarity). Therefore, for any given significance level, we expect the Dickey-Fuller test statistics to be more negative than those in the left hand tail of a normal distribution.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Dickey-Fuller test statistics are derived from an analytical formula that accounts for the presence of a unit root in the data, leading to a distribution different from the normal distribution.

A 95% confidence interval for the intercept term of a model represents the range within which we are confident that the true population parameter lies with 95% certainty.

B,"Let's reason step by step. If a hypothesis test for the intercept coefficient does not lead to rejection of the null hypothesis (that the true value of the intercept is zero), it suggests that there isn't enough statistical evidence to conclude that the intercept differs from zero significantly. This means we should retain the intercept in our regression model, as dropping it could potentially bias the estimates for other coefficients.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Standardized residuals from a GARCH model are assumed to be normally distributed, as the standardization process removes the heteroscedasticity present in the raw residuals. If the GARCH model is appropriate, there should not be any autocorrelation or patterns left in the squared standardized residuals (ii). In practice, financial time series often exhibit fat tails, which means that even after fitting a GARCH model, the standardized residuals may still have heavier tails than a normal distribution (iii).

In classical hypothesis testing, rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically mean accepting the alternative; it simply suggests that there is enough evidence against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.

Transformations like logarithmic functional forms (A) or first differencing (C) are used to stabilize variance and achieve linearity.

If an explanatory variable is non-stochastic, it means it's not entirely deterministic, so there must be some random element involved in its values. However, the term 'non-stochastic' implies that this variability does not change across different samples or observations; hence, it remains constant and fixed. Therefore, the correct answer is that the explanatory variable is fixed in repeated samples.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Durbin Watson statistic is a test statistic used to detect the presence of autocorrelation at lag 1 in the residuals from a regression analysis.

An estimator with minimum variance means it has the smallest possible spread around its expected value.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The significance level is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis, which corresponds to statement (i). Statement (ii) is incorrect because the power of the test refers to the ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis.

The significance level represents the total probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true. In a two-sided test, this probability is divided equally between both tail regions, so each tail would have 2.5% of the distribution. Therefore, statements (i) and (iii) are incorrect because the size of the test refers to the significance level but doesn't specify how it's distributed in a two-tailed test, and statement (ii) is also incorrect as the power of the test relates to correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Adjusted R-squared is not an information criterion, but a measure of model fit that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model; thus, statement (i) is false. Statement (ii) is true because when adding an additional term reduces the residual sum of squares, it generally improves the model's fit and lowers the information criterion value. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) does not always lead to larger model orders than Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), making statement (iii) false. Statement (iv) is true as AIC is consistent, meaning it tends to select the correct model as sample size increases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Information criteria penalize models with more parameters. As the residual sum of squares decreases with added terms, the information criteria value also decreases, indicating a better fit.

Adjusted R-squared is not an information criterion; it adjusts the R-squared value for the number of predictors in a model.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A 99% confidence interval is a range within which we can say with 99% certainty that the true population parameter lies based on our sample data.

Maximum likelihood estimation aims to find parameter values that maximize the probability of observing the given data, which aligns with the principles of minimizing the sum of squared errors in linear regression. GARCH models are indeed estimated using ML methods due to their non-linear nature and time-varying volatility structure; OLS is not suitable for these models. For standard linear models without GARCH, OLS and ML estimates for slope and intercept parameters will be identical since the model is linear, but they differ in estimating variance of disturbances due to different assumptions about error distribution.

Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used in econometrics and time series analysis due to their ability to capture the dynamic interrelationships among multiple variables without requiring a priori theoretical restrictions on causal relationships. While VARs can produce better forecasts than some structural models, this is not universally true as it depends on the specific context and data (eliminating option C). The stationarity of components in a VAR model is indeed important for reliable forecasting; however, techniques such as differencing or cointegration are used to address non-stationary variables within VARs (making D not exclusively true).
