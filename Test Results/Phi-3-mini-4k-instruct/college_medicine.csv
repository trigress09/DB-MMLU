A,"Let's reason step by step. Codons are the basic units of genetic code, which dictate how amino acids are assembled to form proteins during translation. They consist of sequences of nucleotide bases that correspond to specific amino acids or stop signals in mRNA and DNA. Therefore, codons are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that adenine and thymine bind with two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine and guanine bind with three. So it makes sense that codons are composed of quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases. However, the correct answer is triplet sequences because each codon consists of a sequence of three nucleotides in mRNA or DNA.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint activities, rapid and repeated contractions lead to the accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) within muscle cells due to ATP hydrolysis. This Pi can interfere with subsequent muscle contractions, contributing to peripheral muscle fatigue. Therefore, an accumulation of inorganic phosphate is thought to be implicated in the development of this condition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A lack of potassium can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced during multiple sprint activities. This is because potassium plays a crucial role in nerve transmission and muscle contraction. Therefore, the most likely answer among these options would be 'A lack of potassium.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The article mentions that during sauna use, the body loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat and experiences a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This indicates that replenishing fluids is crucial after sauna use to maintain hydration levels and support recovery. Therefore, drinking filtered water would be an important thing for a person to do after using the sauna.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sauna use depletes the body's energy stores, so it would be important to eat a meal to replenish those stores and restore homeostasis. However, considering that sauna bathing is characterized by short-term passive exposure to extreme heat, which induces mild hyperthermia and triggers compensatory mechanisms for cooling the body down, it would be most important to replenish fluids lost through sweating after a sauna session. This helps maintain hydration levels and supports the body's thermoregulatory response.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the new strand based on complementary base pairing, where A pairs with T and C pairs with G. Therefore, if the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T bases, the newly synthesized strand will have an equal but opposite ratio due to this specific pairing rule. The correct answer is B:1:01.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T, then the newly synthesized strand will also have a 3:2 ratio of A:T because they are complementary. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides that pair with those on the template strand (A pairs with T and C pairs with G). Therefore, for every three adenine bases added to the new strand, two thymine bases will be paired.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Severe dehydration and starvation trigger various physiological responses to conserve water, maintain blood pressure, and regulate metabolism. ADH (antidiuretic hormone) is released in response to dehydration to promote water retention. Cortisol levels rise during stressful conditions like starvation as part of the body's fight-or-flight response. Aldosterone helps regulate sodium and potassium balance, which can be affected by dehydration. However, insulin is primarily involved in glucose metabolism and its levels would typically decrease during starvation due to reduced food intake.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aldosterone helps the body retain sodium, which is important for maintaining blood volume and blood pressure. In a state of dehydration and starvation, the body would need to conserve fluids, so aldosterone levels would be elevated. However, insulin, which regulates glucose uptake into cells, would not typically increase in severe dehydration or starvation as these conditions often lead to decreased blood sugar levels due to lack of food intake and reduced metabolic activity.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant is a substance produced in the lungs that reduces surface tension, allowing alveoli to remain open and preventing their collapse during exhalation. This ensures efficient gas exchange between air and blood. In this case, surfactant primarily helps maintain alveoli in an open state for optimal oxygen diffusion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant likely increases the permeability of the alveolar membrane, allowing for easier diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. However, its primary function is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli, preventing their collapse and ensuring they remain open for efficient gas exchange. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be that surfactant maintains alveoli in an open state.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports is influenced by various factors such as physical ability, tactics, and nutrition. However, while ingesting certain supplements like carnitine may have some impact on performance, it does not directly influence success to the same extent as other listed factors. Therefore, 'Ingestion of carnitine during exercise' is less influential in determining sport success.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tactics are not as important as physical training, mental preparation, and a healthy diet for achieving success in sport. While ingesting certain supplements like carnitine may have some benefits during exercise, it is not considered a primary factor influencing overall sports performance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate occurs during glycolysis, a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose for energy production. In this process, two molecules of ATP are produced per glucose molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is two molecules of ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and water molecules are produced as a byproduct. So, the net formation would be six molecules of water. However, this process also generates ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which provides energy for cellular processes. Specifically, glycolysis results in a net gain of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule processed. Therefore, the correct answer is two molecules of ATP.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the principle of continuity, which states that the product of cross-sectional area and velocity remains constant in a steady flow, if the nozzle reduces the area to 1/3 of its original size while maintaining constant pressure, the water velocity must increase proportionally to compensate for the reduced area. Therefore, the final velocity is three times the initial velocity, which equals 6 m/s.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pressure of the water is kept constant, the velocity of the water should also remain constant as it exits the nozzle. This follows from Bernoulli's principle which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. Therefore, despite the area change at the end of the hose, the velocity remains unchanged.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Performance enhancing synthetic steroids are designed to mimic the effects of naturally occurring hormones that can increase muscle mass and strength, which is characteristic of anabolic activity. Testosterone is a well-known anabolic steroid used for such purposes due to its ability to promote protein synthesis in muscles. Therefore, among the given options, testosterone is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Progesterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in muscle development and growth, making it a likely basis for performance-enhancing steroids. While testosterone also influences muscle mass, progesterone has been more directly linked to the synthesis of such substances due to its anabolic properties.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The spectator is making a sweeping generalization about welfare recipients, implying that they are all lazy without considering individual circumstances or evidence. This reflects an unfounded bias against this group, which aligns with the definition of prejudice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The spectator is judging all welfare recipients based on a negative stereotype, which is a characteristic of ethnocentrism. However, in this context, the term 'ethnocentrism' typically refers to evaluating other cultures from one's own perspective, not socio-economic groups within their culture. The statement reflects prejudice as it involves making an unfair and unjustified judgment about a group of people based on limited information or stereotypes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gold (Au) has an atomic number of 79, meaning it has 79 electrons in total. The quantum number l represents the angular momentum and for l=2, we are referring to d-orbitals which can hold a maximum of 10 electrons. However, gold's electron configuration ends with 6d^10, indicating all d orbitals are filled. Therefore, there are no electrons in gold that have quantum number l = 2.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gold is in the d-block of the periodic table and has one electron in its outermost s orbital and ten electrons in its d orbitals, so it should have 1 + 10 = 11 electrons with l = 2. However, this option isn't available among the choices given. The closest correct answer is B (23), which represents the total number of electrons for a neutral gold atom. This implies that all other quantum numbers are considered except l=2.",B

While crying and returning to the mother upon return (B) is expected behavior in young children, avoiding the mother upon return (C) could suggest separation anxiety or an issue with secure attachment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Crying and returning to the mother upon her return is a normal and healthy response that demonstrates a secure attachment between the child and the mother. However, avoiding the mother upon return could indicate ambivalent or anxious-avoidant attachment styles, which are concerning signs in an evaluation of home situation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The article discusses various benefits of sauna use, including reduced risk of cardiovascular-related deaths, decreased likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease, lowered risk of psychotic disorders, and improved mental health. However, there is no mention in the text about a decrease in stroke volume as a benefit of sauna use; instead, it states that during sauna exposure, heart rate increases while stroke volume remains unchanged. Therefore, this option does not align with the benefits described.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The article highlights the numerous health benefits of sauna use, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of dementia. It's likely that these benefits extend to mental health conditions as well, such as anxiety and depression. However, there is no mention in the text about a decreased rate of erectile dysfunction being one of the benefits of sauna use.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong acids are characterized by their ability to completely dissociate into ions in a solution, which means they have stable conjugate bases that can exist independently after donating a proton. This is because the strong acid fully ionizes and does not remain bound in water or retain an open electron spot on its outer valence rings. Therefore, the most accurate statement about strong acids like perchloric acid (HClO4) is that they have stable conjugate bases.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong acids are those that do not fully dissociate in water, meaning their Ka value is less than 1. However, this statement is incorrect as strong acids actually have a Ka greater than 1. The correct characteristic of strong acids is that they completely ionize in solution and therefore don't remain bound to the acid molecule when dissolved in water. Hence, option D which states 'They remain bound in the presence of water.' does not accurately describe strong acids.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The mitochondrion is known as the powerhouse of the cell, where energy production occurs through oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves an electron transport chain embedded in the inner membrane to generate ATP. Therefore, among the given options, components of the electron transport chain are correctly located within the inner membrane of mitochondria.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mitochondria are responsible for energy production, and glycogen is a stored form of glucose, so it makes sense that glycogen molecules would be embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. However, this option is incorrect as glycogen storage occurs primarily in the liver and muscle cells, not within the mitochondria itself. The correct answer is B: components of the electron transport chain are indeed located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion where they play a crucial role in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. An action potential at a motor endplate triggers the release of neurotransmitters to communicate with the muscle fiber, initiating contraction. Acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter released in this process and it crosses the neuromuscular junction to bind with receptors on the muscle membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is acetylcholine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in increasing metabolic activity, so it's likely released at the motor endplate to stimulate muscle activity. However, acetylcholine is the primary neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting signals across neuromuscular junctions and initiating muscle contraction. Therefore, when an action potential arrives at the motor endplate, it causes the release of acetylcholine.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Among the given options, osmosis is a specific type of passive transport that involves the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration. This process does not require energy and relies solely on the gradient of material (water) for directionality. Therefore, osmosis is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Endocytosis involves the movement of materials into the cell through the formation of vesicles, which is driven by the concentration gradient of the material outside the cell. However, it does not exclusively use a gradient to control direction as other processes do. Osmosis and passive transport both rely on gradients for the movement of substances across membranes but osmosis specifically refers to water moving through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of low solute concentration to high, which is not applicable in all cases. Active transport requires energy to move materials against their gradient. Therefore, passive transport best fits the description as it uses only the gradient of material to control direction.",B

The detergent SDS binds uniformly along the protein, imparting a negative charge proportional to its length and thus allowing separation solely based on size during electrophoresis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The SDS detergent helps to prevent the protein from denaturing during electrophoresis, ensuring that the separation is based on the protein's true tertiary structure. This allows for accurate resolution of proteins according to their size.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The article discusses the health benefits of sauna use, particularly its positive effects on cardiovascular health and overall mortality reduction. It mentions that frequent sauna users were less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes and other diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The article also compares the physiological responses of sauna use with moderate-to-vigorous exercise, suggesting it could be an alternative for those unable to engage in physical activity due to chronic disease or limitations. Therefore, among the given options, heart surgery patients who cannot run on treadmills may benefit from sauna use is a statement that aligns with the author's likely agreement based on the information provided.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The article mentions the numerous health benefits of sauna use, including improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of dementia. It's likely that sauna use could also have therapeutic effects on skin conditions. However, there is no specific mention or implication in the text about heart surgery patients benefiting from sauna use as an alternative to exercise (A), dietary benefits (B), or salt restriction being equal to sauna use for hypertensive patients (C). Therefore, based on the information provided, it's reasonable to infer that the author would agree with statement D: 'Patients with skin conditions may be cured with sauna use.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The meniscus shape in a graduated cylinder is determined by the balance between adhesive and cohesive forces of the liquid with respect to the container material. Mercury forms a convex meniscus because its strong cohesive forces outweigh its weak adhesive forces towards glass, causing it to minimize contact area with the walls. Conversely, water has stronger adhesive forces than cohesive ones, leading to a concave meniscus as it spreads along the cylinder's surface. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The shape of the meniscus depends on the interaction between the liquid and the material of the graduated cylinder. Since water forms a concave meniscus, it must have a stronger attraction to the cylinder walls than mercury does. This indicates that adhesive forces are greater for water in this scenario.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose transport into muscle cells is facilitated by a specific type of protein known as GLUT4, which responds to insulin but can also function independently in certain conditions like exercise. However, the question asks for glucose transport 'into' the cell, not under the influence of insulin specifically. Therefore, the correct answer is via protein transporters called GLUT4.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose enters the muscle cell and is immediately acted upon by the enzyme hexokinase, which facilitates its transport across the cell membrane. While GLUT4 transporters are involved in glucose uptake into cells, they require insulin for their activation. However, the question specifically asks about the initial transport mechanism of glucose into muscle cells, making hexokinase the correct answer.",C

The McDonaldization concept, introduced by George Ritzer, refers to the process of rationalization and efficiency in social institutions, inspired by fast-food restaurants like McDonald's. It emphasizes predictability, calculability, and control through non-human technology. Among the options given, a dissolution of hierarchical modes into collaborative decision protocols (C) is not characteristic of McDonaldization, which instead promotes bureaucratic structures with clear hierarchy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. McDonaldization is all about creating efficient systems with clear divisions of labor and established protocols. This aligns perfectly with the characteristics of a bureaucratic organization. However, it does not promote collaborative decision-making or dissolution of hierarchical authority; instead, it emphasizes efficiency through standardized procedures. Therefore, option C is the exception.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training primarily enhances the muscles' ability to utilize oxygen for sustained periods, which is crucial in aerobic metabolism. This type of exercise increases mitochondrial density and improves oxidative enzymes, leading to more efficient fat and carbohydrate burning during prolonged activities. Therefore, the correct answer reflects this adaptation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training focuses on improving the muscle's ability to sustain activity over long periods. This involves enhancing the breakdown of phosphocreatine, which is a key energy source for short bursts of power. However, endurance training primarily increases the muscles' capacity to utilize fat and carbohydrates as fuel during prolonged exercise, making option C the correct answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sprints are high-intensity, short duration exercises that primarily rely on anaerobic energy systems due to the lack of oxygen availability during such intense activities. As the number of sprints increases, the body relies more heavily on these anaerobic pathways for quick bursts of energy. Therefore, the relative contribution of aerobic metabolism decreases as it is less involved in short-term high-intensity efforts like sprinting.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increases, the body's glucose stores become depleted, leading to a significant drop in blood glucose concentration below the critical level of 3 mmol/L. This is because during high-intensity activities like sprinting, the body primarily relies on anaerobic metabolism for energy production due to insufficient oxygen supply. Therefore, the correct answer is that blood glucose concentration falls below 3 mmol/L.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid with 16 carbons, which undergoes beta-oxidation to be broken down into acetyl-CoA units. Each round of beta-oxidation shortens the chain by two carbon atoms and produces one molecule of acetyl-CoA. Since palmitic acid has 16 carbons, it will undergo seven rounds of beta-oxidation to yield eight acetyl-CoA units (as the last round yields two acetyl-CoA). Additionally, this process also generates FADH2 and NADH which are used in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is that beta-oxidation of palmitic acid yields 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA along with some ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid has 16 carbons in its chain. During beta-oxidation, each carbon is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule. Therefore, the complete oxidation of palmitic acid should yield 16 molecules of acetyl-CoA.

B,"Let's reason step by step. After translation, proteins undergo various post-translational modifications to become functional. Lipidation involves the addition of lipid groups and is a common modification that can alter protein localization or function. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds occurs during translation itself, not afterward. Glycosylation and phosphorylation are both post-translational modifications that modify protein structure for specific functions. Therefore, the process not used to modify protein structure after translation is attachment of additional amino acids.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that involves changing the protein's structure by adding sugar molecules, which can affect its folding and function. Lipidation also modifies proteins after translation by attaching lipid groups to them. Phosphorylation adds phosphate groups to proteins, altering their activity or interactions with other molecules.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also known as the Krebs' cycle, is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetate derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide. In one complete turn of this cycle, two molecules of CO2 are produced as waste products. Additionally, three NADH, one FADH2, and one GTP (which can be converted to ATP) are generated per cycle. However, the direct production is only 1 ATP in form of GTP which can then be converted into ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is two CO2 molecules and one ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Krebs cycle generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and also produces NADH and FADH2, which contribute to ATP production in the electron transport chain. Considering all ATP generated, one complete cycle should yield around 16 ATP molecules. However, only 2 CO2 molecules are released as waste products during this process. Therefore, the correct answer is 2CO2 and 16ATP.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate and hydrogen ions are waste products produced during anaerobic respiration in muscles, especially under strenuous exercise conditions. These molecules need to be removed from the muscle cells efficiently due to their potential to cause acidosis if accumulated excessively. Simple diffusion is a passive process that does not require energy and allows small, nonpolar molecules like lactate to move across membranes down their concentration gradient. Therefore, the correct answer is by simple diffusion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, lactate and hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscle.

A deficiency in lipase would therefore have extensive effects on fat absorption, leading to malnutrition and other related issues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carboxypeptidase plays a crucial role in the final stages of protein digestion, ensuring complete breakdown of peptides into individual amino acids for absorption. Its deficiency would significantly impair nutrient uptake.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels in the blood and promotes its uptake into cells, including muscle cells. It also facilitates amino acid uptake for protein synthesis. Therefore, among the given options, insulin is responsible for enhancing both glucose and amino acid uptake by muscles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline is released during stress or exercise, preparing the body for action. It stimulates the breakdown of glycogen and release of glucose into the bloodstream, making it readily available for muscle uptake.

Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and can pass through cell membranes to bind with intracellular receptors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hormone's ability to increase nucleic acid suggests it plays a role in regulating gene expression or DNA replication. This is a typical characteristic of enzymatic hormones, which often act as catalysts in cellular processes. Additionally, the description mentions that this hormone has four hydroxycarbon rings, which aligns with the structure of steroid hormones. However, since it's found both inside and outside cells, it leans more towards being an enzymatic hormone as they can function in various locations within a cell.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that individuals are less likely to offer help in emergencies when there are more people present, due to diffusion of responsibility. In this scenario, if another person is already approaching the girl (Option D), it would reduce the pedestrian's sense of individual responsibility and could potentially change his reaction according to the bystander effect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that the presence of other people diffuses responsibility, making individuals less likely to intervene.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) are designed to selectively target tissues, mimicking the anabolic effects of androgens like testosterone without many of its undesirable side effects typically associated with steroid use. Therefore, they act on androgen receptors but do not fall under the category of traditional steroid drugs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are designed to target specific androgen receptors, but unlike traditional steroids, they block the effects of natural hormones, leading to a more controlled and targeted response.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The reaction described is an E2 elimination, where 2-bromobutane loses a bromine atom and a hydrogen to form an alkene. In this case, the more substituted alkene (2-butene) is favored due to its greater stability compared to less substituted alkenes like 1-butene. This preference for forming more stable products explains why 2-butene is the major product.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethanol, as a nucleophile, has a preference for attacking the second carbon in a chain due to steric hindrance at the first carbon. This explains why 2-butene is the major product in this reaction. The other options do not directly relate to the formation of 2-butene.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen breakdown, also known as glycogenolysis, is a process that provides energy during exercise when glucose levels are low.

Cortisol, however, stimulates glycogen breakdown to increase blood sugar levels for energy during stress or exercise. Therefore, among the given options, cortisol is the hormone that activates glycogen breakdown in exercising muscles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is a hormone released during stress, and in stressful situations like exercise, the body needs to break down glycogen for energy. Insulin typically promotes glucose uptake but not directly stimulates glycogen breakdown. Increased pH does not activate glycogen breakdown either.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Semi-periphery countries, according to the World Systems Theory, are those that share characteristics between core and periphery nations. They typically have a more diversified economy than periphery countries but may not be as developed or influential as core countries. Among the options given, 'A diversified and developed economy' best describes semi-periphery countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Semi-periphery countries are typically still developing, and many developing nations have economies heavily reliant on a single resource like oil or minerals. However, the World Systems Theory emphasizes that semi-periphery countries possess characteristics of both core and periphery countries, including economic diversification and development beyond just one natural resource. Therefore, the best answer is 'A diversified and developed economy.'",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law (PV=nRT), pressure is directly proportional to both the number of moles of gas and temperature when volume and amount of gas are held constant. Therefore, increasing either the temperature or the moles of nitrogen will increase the system's pressure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law, pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. So, decreasing both temperature and volume would increase the pressure. However, since we are looking for two variables that will increase the pressure while holding other variables constant, increasing moles of gas fits this criterion as well because more molecules mean higher pressure at a given volume and temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Increasing temperature' and 'increasing moles of gas'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement B suggests that muscle lactate accumulation does not begin until at least 5 seconds, which contradicts established knowledge about the onset of lactate production during high-intensity exercise. Lactate begins to accumulate in muscles within a few seconds after intense activity starts, making statement B false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which produces ammonia as a byproduct. Muscle lactate accumulation starts almost immediately after muscle contractions begin due to anaerobic glycolysis. The depletion of phosphocreatine also occurs in the initial seconds of high-intensity exercise. However, with repeated sprints, the body adapts and becomes more efficient at clearing lactate, leading to a slower rate of accumulation. Therefore, statement D is false.",D

Among the choices given, platelets are a product of megakaryocytes derived from myeloid lineage, making them the most likely answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Myeloid progenitor cells are involved in the development of immune cells, including T cells, which are essential for adaptive immunity. However, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by a malignant transformation that disrupts normal cell differentiation and function. In this case, the correct answer would be the one related to myeloid lineage rather than lymphoid progenitors.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine loading protocol typically involves a high intake of creatine, usually around 0.3 grams per kilogram body weight daily for the first five days, followed by a maintenance dose. For a 70 kg man, this would equate to approximately 21 grams/day during the loading phase. However, since none of the options match exactly, we choose the closest higher option which is meant to ensure sufficient loading.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is naturally produced in the body, so a small daily supplement of 5g should be enough to load the muscles within a week. This dosage has been widely accepted and recommended by sports nutritionists for effective creatine loading without causing adverse effects.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The gustatory system is responsible for taste perception, which involves chemical reactions between food molecules and taste receptors on the tongue. Similarly, the olfactory system detects odorants through chemoreceptors in the nose. However, the auditory system primarily deals with sound waves rather than direct chemical interactions. Therefore, both gustatory and olfactory systems are chemically based sensory systems.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The gustatory system, responsible for taste, directly interacts with chemicals in food to produce sensations, making it a chemically based system. However, the olfactory system, which is involved in smell, also relies on detecting volatile chemical compounds but does not involve direct interaction like tasting. The auditory system, responsible for hearing, primarily deals with mechanical vibrations and sound waves rather than chemicals. Therefore, only the gustatory system fits the description of a chemically based sensory system.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sensory adaptation refers to a decrease in sensitivity to a constant stimulus over time. Options A, B, and D are examples where our perception adjusts after initial exposure to the stimuli (fabric on back, buzz of conversation, smell of formaldehyde). However, option C describes photoreceptor adaptation, which is not considered sensory or neural adaptation but rather a physiological response in vision. Therefore, it does not fit with the other examples.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sensory adaptation occurs when our senses become less responsive to a constant stimulus, like the buzz of conversation in a crowded room, allowing us to focus on more important information. However, not all changes in perception are due to sensory adaptation; some may be related to other physiological processes or initial reactions. In this case, being blinded by sunlight is an immediate reaction rather than a process of adaptation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The balanced chemical equation for the combustion of ethane is C2H6 + 7/2 O2 -> 2 CO2 + 3 H2O. From this, we can see that one molecule of ethane produces two molecules of carbon dioxide. Given that the molar mass of ethane (C2H6) is approximately 30g/mol and each molecule yields two molecules of CO2 with a molar mass of about 44g/mol, we can calculate the grams of CO2 produced from 84g of C2H6. The correct answer is therefore 528g.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Based on the molecular weights and the reaction equation, 84g of ethane should produce roughly 156g of carbon dioxide. This is calculated using stoichiometry: Ethane (C2H6) has a molar mass of about 30g/mol, so we have approximately 2.8 moles of ethane. Each molecule of ethane produces one molecule of CO2, which has a molar mass of about 44g/mol. Therefore, the reaction would produce roughly 156g (2.8 * 44) of carbon dioxide.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers, also known as type II muscle fibers, are designed for quick bursts of power and strength rather than endurance activities. They have a lower mitochondrial density compared to slow-twitch fibers but higher ATPase activity which allows them to generate energy quickly through anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is that fast-twitch fibers contain a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers are used for quick bursts of energy, so they don't require a lot of mitochondria and have low ATPase activity. Mitochondria produce ATP, the main source of cellular energy, while ATPase is an enzyme that helps in breaking down ATP to release energy. Therefore, fast-twitch fibers contain a relatively small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation between students with overlapping social networks and alumni networks, which is higher than the correlations for GPA and standardized test scores, suggests that connections within these networks significantly influence admission outcomes. This aligns with the concept of 'social capital', where relationships and networks can provide advantages in various contexts, including college admissions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The strong correlation between academic achievements and admission acceptance indicates that the selection process is based on merit and academic performance. However, a higher correlation value (+0.61) for social networks overlapping with alumni networks suggests that connections within these networks significantly influence admissions decisions. This points to the importance of relationships and associations in gaining admission, which aligns with the concept of 'social capital'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Symbolic culture involves the transmission of knowledge through symbols, rituals, or shared beliefs rather than direct learning from experience. In option I, a macaque monkey is simply imitating behavior without understanding symbolic meaning. However, options II and III involve teaching rules (baseball) and rituals (hazing), which are examples of symbolic culture transmission.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hazing rituals serve as a way to transmit cultural knowledge and traditions from older members to new recruits in a military organization. However, the act of a young macaque monkey learning to rinse off food is an example of social learning but not necessarily symbolic culture transmission since it lacks explicit symbols or rules being taught. Therefore, option I does not fit as an example of knowledge through symbolic culture.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA, specifically messenger RNA (mRNA). This occurs in the nucleus where the DNA resides and can be accessed for transcription. The other options are incorrect because ribosomes are involved in translation, not transcription; mRNA synthesis does occur in the cytosol but only after it has been produced in the nucleus; and while cell division involves many processes including replication of DNA, transcription itself is a continuous process that occurs outside of mitosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Transcription involves copying genetic information from DNA to RNA, a process necessary for cell division and replication. This occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells where DNA is housed and protected. Therefore, transcription takes place within the nucleus before mRNA can be transported out to ribosomes for translation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The improvement of world records is often attributed to advancements in training techniques, nutrition, and technology rather than biological changes like muscle mass or inherent abilities such as speed relative to men. Among the given options, starting training at an earlier age (C) could contribute significantly to skill development and performance enhancement over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Over time, women have evolved to have greater muscle mass and athletic capabilities, leading to significant improvements in their performance. However, the most direct factor contributing to this rapid improvement is likely due to increased participation in sports among women, which has led to better training methods, facilities, and support systems.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The officer's unconscious bias is rooted in his past experiences and emotional responses, which are not immediately accessible to conscious awareness but influence behavior nonetheless. This aligns with the psychoanalytic framework that emphasizes the role of unconscious processes shaped by early life experiences.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps individuals identify and challenge their biased thoughts and behaviors, which could explain the officer's actions. This psychological framework focuses on unconscious bias and its impact on decision-making processes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of enzyme kinetics, increasing substrate concentration affects competitive and non-competitive inhibitors differently. For uncompetitive inhibition, where the inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, an increase in substrate concentration would lead to more enzyme-substrate complexes available for binding by the inhibitor, thus increasing its impact. On the other hand, noncompetitive inhibitors can bind regardless of whether the substrate is bound or not; hence, changing substrate concentrations doesn't directly affect their impact. Therefore, the correct answer is that increasing substrate concentration would increase the impact of uncompetitive inhibitor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing substrate concentration wouldn't affect the binding of either type of inhibitor, so there would be no change in their impact on enzyme activity. Therefore, increasing substrate concentration has no effect.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy expenditure of an individual can be estimated using the respiratory quotient (RQ) and oxygen consumption rate. For carbohydrates, RQ is approximately 1, for fats it's around 0.7, and for proteins, it's about 0.8. Assuming a mixed diet with an average RQ of 0.85, we can calculate the energy expenditure using the formula: Energy (kJ/min) = Oxygen consumption rate (l/min) * 20.7. Plugging in the given oxygen consumption rate of 2 l/min gives us approximately 41.4 kJ/min, which is closest to option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Each liter of oxygen consumed roughly corresponds to 20 kJ of energy expenditure, so the athlete would be expending around 200 kJ/min. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sex of a child is determined by the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from both parents, with females having two X chromosomes (XX) and males having one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Since mothers can only contribute an X chromosome, it's the father who determines the sex. Therefore, a child will be male if they inherit a single Y chromosome from their father.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sex-linked traits are determined by recessive alleles on the X chromosome, and since males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to express these traits. However, sex determination in humans is not solely based on a single gene or chromosome but rather on the combination of sex chromosomes inherited from both parents. A child inherits an X chromosome from each parent; thus, it's the presence of a Y chromosome (from the father) that determines male offspring. Therefore, the correct answer is a single Y chromosome from the father.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Signal Detection Theory, a 'miss' occurs when the signal is present but not detected. Since the pilot cannot see the light at 1 mile away despite it being turned on, this situation corresponds to a miss.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pilot correctly identified that there was no signal present, so this would be considered a correct rejection in Signal Detection Theory. This means the light did not meet the required brightness for detection at 1 mile away.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The recommendations focus on increasing access to education, promoting interaction between conflicting groups through community projects, and implementing stricter anti-hate laws. These strategies align with the Contact Hypothesis (II), which suggests that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice under certain conditions. While self-esteem (I) is related to individual attitudes towards oneself and not directly addressed by these recommendations, legal measures (IV) are mentioned but do not encompass all strategies proposed. Therefore, the correct answer includes only the Contact Hypothesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The legal hypothesis suggests that by implementing stricter anti-hate ordinances, individuals will feel more secure and valued, leading to increased self-esteem and willingness to interact with different groups. However, the primary focus of these recommendations is on fostering positive interactions between conflicting groups through education and community projects, which aligns directly with the Contact Hypothesis that suggests prejudice can be reduced by encouraging contact under appropriate conditions. Therefore, the correct answer includes only the Contact Hypothesis.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The son of a bricklayer moving from being a teacher at a medical school to becoming a tenured professor represents an intragenerational mobility within the same generation (son). His promotion and relocation for a new position indicate upward mobility, as he is achieving higher status than his father's occupation. Therefore, the correct answer is 'intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, upward mobility'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Moving across the country for a new tenured professor position signifies an upward mobility as it often involves a higher salary and greater prestige associated with the new institution. The son, who was initially from a bricklayer family, has moved through different educational levels (from college to medical school) which is intragenerational mobility within his own lifetime. Therefore, the correct answer is 'intragenerational mobility with respect to the son', followed by 'upward mobility' due to the new position and finally 'horizontal mobility' as he moved across the country but stayed in a similar professional field.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or potential energy. However, this principle is not directly applicable to blood flow through capillaries as they are too small for significant changes in velocity and thus pressure according to this principle. The correct answer should consider factors like gravity's effect on venous return from the lower body (knee) compared to the upper body (neck). Therefore, option D is most accurate since it acknowledges that additional information about fluid properties would be needed for a precise comparison.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bernoulli's principle primarily deals with ideal fluids, and blood, with its complex composition and properties, requires additional information like viscosity and density for accurate pressure comparisons. However, considering the circulatory system is a closed loop without significant changes in height or external forces affecting it, we can infer that the pressures at different points should be relatively equal to maintain flow continuity. Therefore, option D is correct as an accurate comparison cannot be given without additional information.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. DFP binds to the active site of ACE, which is where the enzyme normally functions. This binding permanently deactivates the enzyme and cannot be reversed by increasing substrate concentration. Therefore, this interaction can best be characterized as irreversible inhibition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since DFP binds to the active site of ACE, it directly competes with the substrate for binding, preventing the enzyme from functioning, which is characteristic of competitive inhibition. However, since the interaction described states that the enzyme is rendered permanently inactive by DFP's binding, this indicates an irreversible process rather than a reversible one typical of competitive inhibitors.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The teacher uses two different reward systems: one for punctuality and another for quiz performance. While both have been effective, the significant improvement in quizzes compared to a slight decrease in tardiness suggests that students responded more strongly to the reinforcement schedule tied to quiz scores. A fixed-ratio schedule rewards behavior after a set number of occurrences (in this case, three consecutive high quiz scores), which can lead to strong and consistent responses.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The significant improvement in quiz performance compared to the slight decrease in tardiness suggests that the students naturally prioritize academic success over punctuality. This indicates that intrinsic motivation towards doing well on quizzes is stronger than extrinsic motivation for being on time, which aligns with choice B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest level of continuous effort an athlete can maintain over a period, typically during endurance events like races. As distance increases, energy stores deplete and fatigue sets in, causing performance to decline. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it declines with the distance of the race.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest level of effort an athlete can maintain consistently throughout a race, therefore it should remain relatively constant. However, factors such as muscle glycogen content play a significant role in determining this power output. A high fat diet might improve endurance but doesn't directly relate to maximum sustainable power during a race. Hence, the most accurate answer is that maximum sustainable power remains relatively constant.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone and neurotransmitter that plays an essential role in the body's fight-or-flight response during stressful situations like exercise. It is primarily secreted from the adrenal glands when there is increased sympathetic nerve activity, which prepares the body for physical exertion by increasing heart rate and blood flow to muscles. Therefore, the correct answer is increased sympathetic nerve activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body utilizes fatty acids as a primary energy source, and the increase in plasma fatty acids triggers the adrenal glands to secrete adrenaline to further mobilize energy reserves. However, it is actually increased sympathetic nerve activity that directly stimulates adrenaline secretion from the adrenal medulla during exercise.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. All options except D are true statements about human physiology. Insulin does promote glucose uptake, but it primarily targets muscle and adipose (fat) tissues rather than all tissues in the body. Therefore, option D is not a completely accurate statement.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Elite endurance runners primarily rely on explosive bursts of speed, which are facilitated by Type II muscle fibers, not Type I fibers known for their endurance capabilities. Therefore, the statement that elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres is incorrect.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle fibers contract when the nerve stimulus is present, causing calcium ions to bind with troponin and move tropomyosin away from actin binding sites. When this stimulus ceases, calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration. This causes the dissociation of calcium from troponin and allows tropomyosin to cover actin binding sites again, preventing myosin from attaching to actin and thus causing muscle relaxation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When the nerve stimulus becomes too forceful, it can overload the muscle fibers, leading to a temporary relaxation to prevent damage. This phenomenon is known as tetanus or tetanic contraction. Therefore, among the given options, the most accurate answer would be that a muscle fiber relaxes when the nerve stimulus is too forceful.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses various health benefits associated with sauna use, including reduced risk of cardiovascular-related deaths and dementia, as well as improved mental health outcomes. These findings are based on studies conducted in Finland where sauna usage is prevalent. Among the options provided, increased rate of pets in the household (C) does not have a direct correlation with sauna use or its benefits. Improved marriage satisfaction rates (D), while potentially influenced by overall health and well-being, are too broad to be directly linked to sauna usage based on the information given. Gold medals in adolescent skiing (A) could indirectly relate to a country's culture of physical activity but not specifically to sauna use. The most plausible option that can be more prevalent due to sauna use, as suggested by the passage, is increased rate of pets in the household (C), assuming there might be an association between pet ownership and lifestyle choices influenced by health consciousness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The stress-reducing and health-promoting effects of sauna use likely contribute to improved communication and emotional connection between partners, leading to higher marriage satisfaction rates in Finland. Additionally, the cultural significance of saunas in Finnish society may also play a role in fostering stronger marital bonds. Therefore, it is more plausible that there are improved marriage satisfaction rates in Finland compared to other countries.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The hypothalamus releases Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to initiate the stress response, leading to cortisol release. This process is regulated through a negative feedback loop where high levels of cortisol inhibit further CRH production and secretion. Therefore, the mechanism that suppresses this trigger is the negative feedback loop of cortisol.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As cortisol levels rise, the body triggers vasoconstriction of blood vessels supplying the adrenal gland, reducing its ability to produce more cortisol and thus suppressing the stress response. However, this is not the primary mechanism for long-term regulation. The hypothalamus releases CRF which stimulates cortisol production; when cortisol levels are high enough, they inhibit further release of CRF through a negative feedback loop, effectively controlling and suppressing the stress response.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine resynthesis is a process that occurs during recovery from exercise, where the body replenishes its phosphocreatine stores to restore energy levels. This process requires oxygen for aerobic metabolism and ATP production. An excess of oxygen would actually facilitate this process rather than inhibit it. Therefore, a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) during recovery could impair the resynthesis of phosphocreatine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When oxygen is abundant, the body primarily relies on aerobic metabolism for energy production, which reduces the need for phosphocreatine resynthesis, thus inhibiting the process. Therefore, an excess of oxygen would not hinder this recovery mechanism but rather facilitate it.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. David is a nationally ranked cellist and has high standards for himself as he compares to better players and struggles with mastering sections. This suggests that while his self-efficacy, or belief in his ability to succeed, may be strong due to his achievements, his self-esteem might not be very high because of the constant comparison and harsh self-criticism. However, since he is actively working on improving by practicing with sheet music, it indicates an internal locus of control where he believes that outcomes are a result of his own efforts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. David's constant comparison to better players and harsh self-assessment suggest a belief that his success is determined by external factors and a lack of confidence in his own abilities.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and they have a basic structure consisting of an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a side chain. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid, not an amino acid, as it lacks the characteristic functional groups found in amino acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamic acid, like palmitic acid, ends with ""ic acid"", which is a common characteristic of fatty acids, indicating it is not an amino acid. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and have unique structures that differentiate them from fats or lipids such as palmitic acid.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate is produced during anaerobic metabolism in muscles, especially under strenuous exercise conditions. It can be transported to the liver where it may be converted back into glucose through a process known as gluconeogenesis. However, this conversion does not occur directly within circulation but rather inside hepatocytes (liver cells). The main fate of lactate in the bloodstream is its uptake by other tissues such as heart and brain for oxidation to produce energy. Therefore, option D best describes the primary role of lactate once it enters the circulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate, a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, is transported to the liver where it enters the urea cycle and is converted into urea for excretion. However, this process does not represent its main fate in circulation. Instead, lactate can be taken up by other tissues such as heart or brain, which use it as an energy source through oxidation. Therefore, the primary destination of lactate leaving muscle and entering circulation is uptake and subsequent oxidation by these tissues.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In genetics, an allele that is masked or not expressed when paired with a dominant allele in a heterozygous individual is known as recessive. This term comes from the concept of dominance and recessiveness where the recessive trait only manifests if both alleles are recessive.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A masked allele is one that is actively repressed or silenced by regulatory mechanisms, preventing its expression. Among the given options, 'repressed' best describes this phenomenon as it implies inhibition of gene expression.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A temptation is often associated with something that can be detrimental if indulged excessively, especially when it comes to survival needs like food and water. In this context, the statement where a person gives in to their craving despite having an intention (losing weight) suggests that desire has turned into a temptation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The free diver's decision to stay at the beach longer despite needing to regain their breath suggests they are prioritizing the enjoyment of the beach over their physiological need for oxygen, making it a temptation. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP and phosphocreatine are the primary sources of energy for high-intensity, short-duration exercises like maximal exertion activities. The breakdown of these molecules releases a quick burst of energy but is exhausted rapidly. Therefore, their contribution to sustaining such exercise lasts only for about 1-2 seconds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides rapid energy for short bursts of intense activity, lasting approximately 30-40 seconds before other energy systems take over. This aligns with the duration that can be sustained during maximal exertion exercise.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance events like marathons require sustained energy production, efficient oxygen supply to muscles, temperature regulation during prolonged exercise, and adequate carbohydrate stores for fuel. However, while ATP and phosphocreatine are important for short bursts of activity, they are not as crucial in long-duration events like marathons where aerobic metabolism predominates. Therefore, the least important characteristic among these options is muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for endurance activities, and having ample carbohydrate stores is more critical than oxygen supply for sustained performance in events like marathons. While temperature regulation, oxygen delivery, and muscle ATP content all contribute to success, availability of body stores of carbohydrates (C) plays a unique role as it directly impacts the duration an athlete can maintain high-intensity exercise.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Steroid-based molecules are characterized by a specific structure known as the steroid nucleus or backbone. Testosterone and progesterone are both hormones that contain this steroid structure, while triglycerides are fats composed of glycerol and fatty acids, and DNA is a nucleic acid with a different structural composition. Therefore, the correct answer includes only testosterone and progesterone.",C,"Let's reason step by step. DNA, like testosterone and progesterone, is a complex molecule with a critical role in various biological processes, suggesting it also belongs to the steroid family. However, among the options given, only testosterone and progesterone are classified as steroid hormones. Triglycerides, while they contain carbon atoms like steroids, do not have the same structure or function. Therefore, the correct answer is that both testosterone and progesterone are steroid-based molecules.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mile race is a long-distance running event, and the individuals listed are all athletes known for their achievements in different sports or events. William George 'Billy' George was an English athlete who set world records during his career. In 1886, he indeed held the world record for the mile race. Therefore, the correct answer is WG George.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Joe DiMaggio is a well-known athlete, and athleticism is often associated with running and setting records.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatigue is a complex phenomenon influenced by various neurotransmitters in the brain, including dopamine and serotonin which are known to regulate mood and energy levels. Pharmacological agents that alter these neurotransmitters can therefore impact fatigue development. Hence, the correct answer is Dopamine and Serotonin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamate and serotonin are both involved in regulating mood and sleep, which are closely related to fatigue. Pharmacological agents that alter these neurotransmitters can potentially influence the development of fatigue. Therefore, the correct answer is glutamate and serotonin.",C

A child who experiences frequent neglect is likely to have an insecure attachment style and may seek attachment to any available adult, including the male psychologist. Among the options provided, the eight-month-old male infant raised by a single caregiver who frequently neglects him (Option C) would be most prone to forming an attachment with someone new due to his previous experiences.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood lactate concentration is a marker for anaerobic metabolism, which increases when muscles are under high stress or oxygen debt, such as during intense physical activity like soccer. As the game progresses and players become more fatigued, their bodies rely more on anaerobic processes to meet energy demands, leading to a rise in blood lactate levels. Therefore, the correct answer is that it increases throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As players exert themselves more throughout the game, their muscles produce more lactate, leading to a continuous increase in blood lactate concentration. This is due to anaerobic metabolism when oxygen supply can't meet demand during intense physical activity. Therefore, the correct answer is that it increases throughout the course of the game as players become more fatigued.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation, a process that generates energy from fat molecules. This transport is facilitated by carnitine, which forms a complex with fatty acids to enable their passage across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is carnitine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Thiokinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, so it makes sense that it would be involved in transporting fatty acids into the mitochondria. However, carnitine specifically facilitates the transfer of long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix for beta-oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is carnitine.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are metabolized within muscles, where their deamination process generates ammonia as a waste product. This ammonia is then converted into less toxic substances before being excreted. In this case, the correct answer is that it's primarily converted into urea and released from the muscle.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Arginine plays a role in the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body, so it's likely involved in processing ammonia from branched-chain amino acid deamination as well. However, alanine and glutamine are directly related to transporting nitrogenous waste (in this case, ammonia) out of muscle tissue. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that ammonia produced during the deamination process in muscles is converted into alanine and glutamine for release from the muscle.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. During high rates of glycolysis, lactic acid is produced which can lower the pH in cells. Carnosine acts as an intracellular buffer that helps to neutralize this acid and maintain a stable pH level within the cell. Therefore, among the given options, carnosine is known for its role in limiting pH changes during high glycolysis rates.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamine is involved in nitrogen transport and helps regulate pH balance in the kidneys, so it could also act as an intracellular buffer during high glycolysis rates. However, carnosine specifically acts within muscle cells to stabilize pH levels when metabolic activity increases due to its ability to bind protons.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Free fatty acids are hydrophobic and cannot travel freely in the aqueous environment of blood plasma. They require transport proteins for solubilization and distribution throughout the body. The most common form of transport is via lipoproteins, which have both lipophilic (fat-soluble) and hydrophilic (water-soluble) components to facilitate this process. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are primarily transported as lipoproteins.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lipoproteins are responsible for transporting lipids in the blood, so it's reasonable to assume they would also transport free fatty acids. Free fatty acids cannot be combined with glucose nor are they bound inside red blood cells or albumin specifically for their transportation. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that free fatty acids are transported as lipoproteins.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can occur due to various factors, including errors during DNA replication or exposure to certain environmental agents. However, not all mutations result in harmful effects; some may be neutral or even beneficial. The statement that they 'only occur in the presence of carcinogens' is too restrictive as mutations can also happen spontaneously without external factors. Considering these points, the most accurate answer is that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, and any alteration to the genetic code is likely to have detrimental effects on the organism. However, not all mutations result in harm; some can be neutral or even beneficial under certain circumstances. The statement that they 'always' cause harm is too absolute. Mutations do occur spontaneously and are a natural part of genetic variation. Therefore, the most accurate answer among the options provided is that mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is indeed a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, making statement A true. Type II fibers are fast-twitch and rely more on anaerobic metabolism, while type I fibers are slow-twitch and have higher oxidative capacity; thus, phosphorylase activity is typically lower in type I than in type II fibers, making statement B false. Endurance training does increase the amount of enzymes involved in energy production pathways like the TCA cycle, confirming statement C as true. The TCA cycle itself produces ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and consumes oxygen indirectly by producing NADH and FADH2 that enter the electron transport chain; however, it does not directly consume oxygen, making statement D false.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training improves the body's ability to utilize oxygen for energy production, and the TCA cycle is a key pathway in aerobic metabolism, so it makes sense that endurance training would increase TCA cycle enzymes. However, phosphorylase activity is actually higher in Type I fibres (slow-twitch), which are more oxidative than Type II fibres (fast-twitch). Therefore, the statement 'Phosphorylase activity is higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres' is false.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) measures the relative affinity of compounds for a stationary phase and a mobile phase, which is reflected in their Rf values. A higher Rf value indicates less interaction with the stationary phase and more solubility in the mobile phase. In this case, an SN2 reaction typically results in products that are similar to reactants due to backside attack and substitution at the same carbon atom. However, nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions often result in significant changes in polarity between reactants and products, which can lead to higher Rf values for products if they become more soluble in the mobile phase compared to reactants.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that involves the breakdown of glucose and glycogen into smaller molecules, primarily producing pyruvate or lactate as end products under anaerobic conditions. This process does not directly produce acetyl CoA; instead, it leads to either pyruvate or lactate depending on the cellular oxygen levels. Therefore, the correct answer is glycogen or glucose being converted into pyruvate or lactate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis involves breaking down complex sugars, and the first step in utilizing glycogen for energy is converting it to glucose-1-phosphate. However, this does not represent the entirety of glycolysis pathway. The correct answer should describe the end products of glycolysis when starting with either glycogen or glucose. Glycolysis ultimately converts these substrates into pyruvate and lactate (or acetyl CoA in aerobic conditions). Therefore, option C is the most accurate.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Boyle's Law, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature and amount of gas are held constant. Therefore, if the initial volume is 0.1L at 200atm, reducing the pressure to 1atm will increase the volume proportionally. The correct answer reflects this inverse relationship.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the pressure decreases from 200 atm to 1 atm, the volume should increase proportionally, resulting in a volume of 20 L.

To find the required acceleration, we can use the kinematic equation: v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is final velocity (converted to meters per second), u is initial velocity (0 m/s as it starts from rest), a is acceleration and s is distance. Converting 130 km/h to m/s gives approximately 36.11 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get: (36.11)^2 = 0 + 2a(50). Solving for a yields an acceleration of about 7 m/s^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Triacylglycerides, also known as triglycerides, are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Triacylglycerides contain a glycerol backbone, and phospholipids, which also have a glycerol backbone, are linked by phosphodiester bonds, so it's likely that triacylglycerides also have phosphodiester linkages. However, the correct structure of triacylglycerides is based on ester linkages between fatty acids and glycerol, not phosphodiester linkages. Therefore, the answer indicating both a glycerol backbone and three ester linkages is correct.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gene expression can be regulated through various mechanisms, including histone modifications and chromatin structure changes. Increased histone acetyltransferase activity generally leads to gene activation, while decreased histone deacetyltransferase activity also promotes gene expression due to less removal of acetyl groups from histones. Methylation can either activate or repress gene expression depending on the context. However, an increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio typically leads to decreased gene expression as heterochromatin is a more condensed form of DNA that is less accessible for transcription.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Histone acetyltransferase activity is involved in modifying chromatin structure, and increased activity would lead to tighter DNA packing, making it less accessible for gene expression. Conversely, decreased histone deacetyltransferase activity or an increase in methylation activity can both result in a more open chromatin state conducive to gene expression. The correct answer is the one that leads to tighter DNA packing and thus reduced gene expression.",D

Using the formula f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where f is the original frequency (800Hz), v is the speed of sound in air (~343 m/s), vo is the velocity of the observer (camera, 72 km/h or ~20 m/s), and vs is the velocity of the source (car, 108 km/h or ~30 m/s). Plugging these values in gives us a perceived frequency of approximately 941 Hz.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the perceived frequency, we need to consider the relative velocity between the source and observer. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their velocities and use the Doppler effect equation to calculate the perceived frequency. The difference in speed is 108 km/h - 72 km/h = 36 km/h or approximately 9.44 m/s. Using the formula f' = f * (v + vo) / (v + vs), where v is the speed of sound (approximately 343 m/s), f is the original frequency, and vo and vs are the velocities of observer and source respectively, we find that the perceived frequency is approximately 924 Hz.",C

Therefore, during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high intensity exercise, we can expect that the blood glucose concentration would frequently fall.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on fat for fuel, leading to a decrease in blood glucose levels as it is spared.

D,"Let's reason step by step. When HCl is added to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2, it reacts with the hydroxide ions (OH-) present in the solution to form water and magnesium chloride (MgCl2). This reaction reduces the concentration of OH- ions, potentially causing more Mg(OH)2 to precipitate out of the solution. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Mg(OH)2 precipitates.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adding HCl to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2 will increase the concentration of Cl- ions, exceeding the solubility product of MgCl2 and causing it to precipitate out of the solution. The Ksp for Mg(OH)2 does not change as it is an equilibrium constant. Therefore, the correct answer is that MgCl2 precipitates.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body requires immediate energy that cannot be supplied quickly enough through aerobic metabolism alone due to limited oxygen availability. This leads to an increased reliance on anaerobic processes for rapid ATP production. Therefore, a higher intensity of exercise correlates with a greater proportional contribution from anaerobic energy production.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As exercise intensity increases, the body relies more on aerobic metabolism, and the TCA cycle plays a crucial role in generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The phase diagram for water shows that ice (solid water, H2O(s)) has a lower density than liquid water (H2O(l)). This is due to the open crystalline structure formed by hydrogen bonds in ice, which takes up more space compared to the closely packed molecules of liquid water. Therefore, under normal conditions, solid water will float on liquid water because it has a lower density.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Water is denser in its liquid form than as ice.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP in the process. Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs twice during glycolysis: once when 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate (producing 2 ATP) and again when phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate (also producing 2 ATP). Therefore, the net production of ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis from glucose alone is 4. Glycogen does not directly contribute to this process.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This process aligns with the mismatch repair mechanism's role in identifying and fixing base-pairing mistakes post replication.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for identifying and correcting errors shortly after DNA replication, including the removal of incorrect bases that were incorporated during the process.

Therefore, collectively they would produce more than 3 but less than 6 ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Each FADH2 molecule can contribute to the production of 2 ATP, and each NADH+H molecule can contribute to the production of 3 ATP, so together they can generate a total of 3 ATP.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetic material is responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information in living organisms. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the primary molecule that carries this genetic information, while ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a role in protein synthesis based on DNA's instructions. Dinitronucleic acid and proteins are not known to carry genetic material. Therefore, the correct answer is deoxyribonucleic acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. RNA is the primary genetic material responsible for carrying and transmitting genetic information within cells. However, when referring to our complete set of genetic instructions, we are talking about DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is deoxyribonucleic acid.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for high-intensity exercises, and a low intake can lead to reduced availability of muscle glycogen stores. This deficiency may impair performance during such activities due to insufficient fuel supply. Therefore, the correct answer is that it 'may impair high intensity exercise performance.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are primarily used for endurance activities, so a low-carbohydrate diet would not have a significant impact on exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes. However, during high intensity exercises, the body relies heavily on carbohydrates as fuel; thus, a low intake of carbs may impair performance due to insufficient glycogen stores. Therefore, the correct answer is that it 'may impair high-intensity exercise performance.'",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's agitation and aggressive behavior, along with their claim of needing medication or fearing 'bad things', suggest a possible imbalance in neurotransmitters like dopamine which is associated with mood regulation and reward pathways. Among the options given, decreased dopamine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane (B) could lead to such symptoms due to reduced responsiveness of neurons to dopamine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a disruption in dopamine signaling, likely due to seizure-like activity in brain regions associated with dopamine production and regulation. This aligns most closely with option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is an organelle found within muscle cells that plays a key role in regulating intracellular calcium levels, which are essential for muscle contraction and relaxation. Among the given options, it serves as a store of calcium ions (D), not digestive enzymes (A), sodium ions (B), or lipids (C).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in muscle contraction, and muscle contraction relies on the movement of sodium ions to generate action potentials. However, it primarily acts as a reservoir for calcium ions which are released during muscle contractions. Therefore, the correct answer is that the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells acts as a store of calcium ions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both meiosis and mitosis are cell division processes that involve distinct phases. However, phase G2 is common to both as it represents the period of rapid cell growth and protein synthesis before the actual division process begins in both cases. Phase S (synthesis) also occurs in both but is not listed among the options provided. Therefore, only phase G2 is common between meiosis and mitosis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both meiosis and mitosis involve periods of cell growth and DNA replication, so phases G0 and G2 must be common to both processes. However, phase S is specific to the process of DNA synthesis during interphase in mitosis or meiosis I, but not a distinct phase unique to either process. Therefore, only phases G0 and G2 are common to cells undergoing both meiosis and mitosis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency is influenced by the speed of sound in a medium, as it affects how fast the wave travels, and the frequency of emitted sound, since this determines the initial conditions for the shift calculation. Time of interaction and distance between source and detector are not directly used to calculate Doppler shift but rather relate to other aspects of wave propagation. Therefore, knowing both the speed of sound in medium (I) and the frequency of emitted sound (IV) is essential.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler effect is about how sound changes as it travels, so we need to know the distance between the source and detector to account for sound wave spreading and attenuation. Additionally, knowing the frequency of emitted sound allows us to calculate the change in perceived frequency due to relative motion. Therefore, both I (speed of sound) and IV (frequency of emitted sound) are necessary.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A point mutation changes a single nucleotide, while a deletion removes one or more nucleotides from the sequence. Comparing each option to the original sequence (5’-GGATCCTCATG-3’), we can see that option B has both changed and removed nucleotides: 'T' replaces 'G', and 'A' is deleted, making it a combination of point mutation and deletion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A deletion means a significant portion of the DNA sequence is removed, so the resulting segment should be much shorter than the original. A point mutation refers to a change in a single nucleotide base pair. Comparing each option with the original sequence, only option B shows both a point mutation (T instead of G) and deletion (missing 'A' and 'C').",B

This behavior aligns with characteristics often associated with narcissistic personality disorder, which includes an inflated self-importance and lack of empathy for others.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is clearly seeking attention with his outburst and wants to be the center of focus, which aligns with the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder. This disorder often involves excessive emotionality and a need for approval or attention from others.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The electron transport chain creates a gradient of H+ ions across the mitochondrial membrane, which is then used to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. This process requires energy and involves moving substances against their concentration gradient, indicating that it is an active process. Therefore, the mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria must be active transport.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The H+ ions move from an area of high concentration to low concentration across the membrane, so it must be a process of passive diffusion. However, since this movement is against the gradient and requires energy, it is actually active transport.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Neurons communicate through electrical signals called action potentials, which involve specific structures and processes within a neuron. Dendrites receive signals but do not secrete neurotransmitters; this function is performed at the axon terminals. Therefore, option C is incorrect as it inaccurately describes dendrite activity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperpolarization makes the neuron more negative, which makes it harder to reach the threshold for an action potential, thus limiting the firing rate. The flow of sodium into a neuron indeed depolarizes its membrane during the first phase of an action potential. An action potential is initiated at the axon hillock when the threshold potential is reached. However, neurotransmitters are secreted from the axon terminals (not dendrites) into the synaptic cleft.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. DNA is composed of nucleotides, which consist of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base that can be either purine or pyrimidine. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA. Therefore, among the options given, amino acid is the molecule that does not form part of DNA.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ribose is a sugar molecule involved in nucleic acid structure, and since DNA is a nucleic acid, ribose must be a part of it. However, deoxyribose is the specific sugar found in DNA, not RNA (which contains ribose). Purines and pyrimidines are nitrogenous bases that form base pairs with each other to create the rungs of the DNA ladder. Amino acids, on the other hand, are building blocks for proteins, not nucleic acids like DNA. Therefore, amino acid is the molecule that does not form part of DNA.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material present in an organism, which includes all its DNA sequences. This encompasses not just individual chromosomes but also non-coding regions and regulatory elements. Therefore, among the given options, the one that best describes a genome is the entire DNA sequence of an organism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material, which is organized into chromosomes, so it must be the number of chromosomes in somatic cells. However, this definition does not encompass all DNA sequences within an organism. Instead, a genome includes all DNA sequences that encode for proteins and RNA molecules, making option B - 'the entire DNA sequence of an organism' - the most accurate description.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A ventricular septal defect (VSD) allows blood to flow between the left and right ventricles, mixing oxygen-rich blood from the left with oxygen-poor blood in the right. This would result in a higher percentage of oxygen in the right ventricle due to this mixing. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If there's a hole between the ventricles, some deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle will mix with the oxygenated blood in the left atrium, lowering the oxygen percentage. Therefore, option C is correct as it states that the oxygen level would be lower in the right atrium due to this mixing.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism is a process that occurs when cells generate energy in the form of ATP without using oxygen, typically during intense exercise or low-oxygen conditions. This contrasts with aerobic metabolism which requires oxygen to produce ATP. Therefore, the correct answer must relate to this lack of oxygen usage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism means there's no oxygen available, so the body must rely on glycogen stores for energy production. However, it does not exclude ADP involvement or use of glycogen; rather, these are conditions under which anaerobic metabolism occurs. The key aspect is that ATP generation happens without using oxygen, making option D the most accurate choice.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a key energy source for high-intensity, short-duration exercises such as sprinting or weightlifting. After intense exercise, the body needs time to resynthesize phosphocreatine from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and creatine. This process typically takes around 3 minutes for complete restoration, but it can be faster during recovery periods immediately following exercise. Among the given options, about 1 minute is closest to this time frame.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is used for quick bursts of energy, so its resynthesis should be relatively fast, likely within seconds. Among the options given, about 10 seconds seems to be a reasonable time frame for phosphocreatine resynthesis after very high intensity exercise.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. When sound travels from one medium to another, its velocity and wavelength change due to the difference in density between the two media. However, frequency remains constant because it is determined by the source of the sound. Therefore, the property that does not change when a sound exits one medium and enters a denser medium is the frequency.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wavelength is a fundamental property of a sound wave and doesn't change regardless of the medium it's traveling through. However, velocity, intensity, and frequency can all be affected when a sound wave transitions from one medium to another due to differences in density and elasticity. Therefore, the correct answer is that wavelength does not change.",D

A health smoothie store offers healthier options than a coffee shop, making it a better environment for studying and maintaining focus on his weight loss goals. However, rewarding himself with high-calorie meals contradicts the objective of reducing caloric intake. Physical punishment like snapping oneself is not recommended or effective in managing dietary habits. Therefore, option B is NOT a good method to restrict caloric intake.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Self-efficacy refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. Strategies that enhance self-efficacy typically involve mastery experiences, social modeling, and positive feedback. Avoiding tasks due to lack of proficiency does not contribute to building self-efficacy but rather hinders it.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Building self-efficacy involves gaining confidence through positive feedback and encouragement, so seeking positive feedback from friends is a crucial strategy. Daily practice on desired tasks helps improve skills and boost self-efficacy. Observing others who excel can provide motivation and strategies for improvement. However, avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she's not proficient in would hinder her progress and learning opportunities, which is counterproductive to building self-efficacy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The process of synthesizing glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, or amino acids is known as gluconeogenesis. This pathway allows the body to maintain blood sugar levels during fasting states or intense exercise when carbohydrates are not readily available.

Rational choice theory is a framework for understanding social and economic behavior, which assumes that individuals make decisions based on maximizing their personal benefit. The three main assumptions mentioned - completeness (all options are known), transitivity (consistent preferences), and independence of irrelevant alternatives (preferences remain unchanged with the introduction or removal of other choices) - align well with a system where individual decision-making is paramount, without hierarchical control from above. Therefore, it best describes an oligarchic system.",D,"{

D,"Let's reason step by step. During muscle contraction, ATP is required for both the power stroke and the subsequent detachment of myosin from actin to allow relaxation between contractions. While tropomyosin-troponin interaction (A) and calcium-troponin interaction (C) are important in regulating muscle contraction, they do not directly require ATP for their processes. Myosin-actin interaction (B) is a continuous process during the power stroke but does not specifically refer to an ATP requirement outside of this context. Therefore, myosin-actin detachment (D), which allows the cycle to repeat and muscles to relax, requires ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves myosin pulling on actin filaments, and this interaction requires energy from ATP to initiate the movement. The power stroke is just one part of this process; afterward, for muscles to relax and detach properly, another ATP-dependent action must occur. This action is known as myosin-actin detachment, which allows the filaments to return to their resting state.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme involved in energy metabolism, particularly in muscle cells where it helps to regenerate ATP from ADP and creatine phosphate during high-intensity activities. An increase in CK activity typically occurs when there's a higher demand for ATP, which correlates with increased intracellular ADP levels as the cell attempts to produce more energy. Therefore, option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Enzymes are sensitive to pH changes, and a lower pH usually reduces their activity, so creatine kinase activity would decrease when muscle pH falls. However, this enzyme is involved in energy transfer within cells, particularly during high-intensity exercise where ADP levels rise due to increased ATP consumption. Therefore, the correct answer reflects its role in response to intracellular conditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, releasing energy in the form of ATP. This process occurs within cells and does not require oxygen. The enzymes responsible for glycolysis are found in a specific cellular location where these processes take place. In this case, the correct answer is that the enzymes of glycolysis are located in the cytoplasm.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is part of cellular respiration, and cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria, so the enzymes must be located there.

The correct answer is that prior to reaching R, the cell has 46 chromosomes and 46 chromatids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Before the restriction point, the cell has not yet duplicated its genetic material, so it should have half the number of chromosomes and chromatids it will have after division. In humans, a somatic cell normally contains 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), which would be present as 23 individual chromatids before replication occurs.

Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people, where the desire for harmony or conformity results in an irrational decision-making outcome. It typically involves overestimating one's own abilities and minimizing conflict to maintain consensus. However, high loyalty and cohesiveness actually suppress dissenting opinions rather than encourage them. Therefore, option C is the exception.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Groupthink is all about generating as many ideas as possible to find the best solution, so individual creativity is essential. However, groupthink often leads to a decrease in this due to the desire for harmony and consensus within the group. Therefore, option C, which describes high loyalty and cohesiveness leading to open discussion of controversial issues, does not characterize groupthink but rather counters it.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the minimum level of stimulus that an organism can detect. In this experiment, as power levels decrease from 80% to 60%, fewer mice press the lever, indicating a lower detection rate. However, without knowing how many or what percentage of mice pressed the lever at even lower power levels, we cannot definitively determine the absolute threshold.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the minimum stimulus needed for detection, so it should correspond to the power level where the most mice, 20 in this case, reacted to the bell.

The correct answer should encompass these two aspects, which are the rate of lactate appearance (production) and its clearance from the bloodstream. Therefore, option D accurately describes this relationship.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate is primarily produced during anaerobic glycolysis, so the rate of lactate accumulation should be directly determined by the rate of this metabolic pathway.

In a double-stranded DNA molecule, the bases pair up in specific ways: adenine (a purine) pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine), and guanine (another purine) pairs with cytosine (another pyrimidine). This complementary base pairing ensures that for every adenine there is a corresponding thymine, and for every guanine, there's a cytosine. Therefore, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines in DNA is always 1:1.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Different organisms have different genetic makeups, which could influence the types and amounts of bases they utilize in their DNA, leading to variations in the purine:pyrimidine ratio. However, regardless of these differences, according to Chargaff's rules, within a double-stranded molecule of DNA from any organism, adenine (a purine) always pairs with thymine (a pyrimidine), and guanine (another purine) always pairs with cytosine (another pyrimidine). This base pairing ensures that the amount of adenine is equal to thymine, and the amount of guanine equals cytosine.

Therefore, the correct sequence is 'taboo, folkways, the law, mores'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The teenager's actions primarily involve breaking laws and violating common courtesy, so the order of violations should be based on legal consequences and social faux pas. Having consensual sex with a sibling is illegal (the law), leaving no tip at the bar is considered rude but not legally punishable (folkways), non-consensual sexual relations are both illegal and morally reprehensible (the law, taboo).

This disruption in energy production can lead to cell asphyxiation and potentially death.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking the final step of the electron transport chain would likely trigger a negative feedback mechanism, causing the cell to increase ATP production through other means, such as anaerobic respiration.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The creatine kinase reaction is a crucial part of energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity exercise when ATP levels are rapidly depleted. This reaction helps to maintain ATP levels by transferring phosphate groups from creatine phosphate to ADP, forming ATP and creatine. It's known for its rapid response in providing immediate energy supply, which is not slow compared with glycolysis (B). The reaction does not wait until all the ATP has been used up (C), nor is it directly inhibited by low pH in muscle (D). However, like many biochemical reactions, it can be influenced by various factors but isn't inherently irreversible (A).",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the correct answer is that hydrogen ions are formed when pyruvate is converted to lactate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of phosphocreatine, like ATP, releases energy and involves the transfer of phosphate groups, which could potentially lead to the release of hydrogen ions. However, this process does not directly result in a high concentration of hydrogen ions.

Among the options given, Type IIX fibers (also known as Type IIb) are the most fast-twitch and fatigue quickly during all-out exercise like sprinting.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since Type II fibers are generally faster-twitch than Type I fibers, it follows that the subtype Ia would fatigue faster than IIa in high-intensity exercise.

B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP resynthesis during exercise is crucial for muscle contraction and energy supply. Among the options, phosphocreatine breakdown provides immediate but limited ATP replenishment through a process called creatine kinase reaction. This method is faster than glycolysis or glycogenolysis, which are slower processes involving glucose metabolism. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) occurs in mitochondria and requires oxygen, making it less rapid for immediate ATP resynthesis during intense exercise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body needs a rapid supply of glucose to fuel muscle contractions. Glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, provides this readily available glucose. However, for immediate ATP resynthesis, phosphocreatine breakdown is faster than other processes like glycolysis or the Krebs' cycle. Therefore, the most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through phosphocreatine breakdown.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Human somatic cells are any cell in the body except for sperm and egg cells, which are gametes. These cells contain a full set of chromosomes, half contributed from each parent, resulting in 46 chromosomes in total. Therefore, all human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, one set from each parent. Therefore, each somatic cell, containing a full set of chromosomes, would have 3 chromosomes in total. However, the question asks for the number of chromosomes in all human somatic cells combined, which is double that amount since there are two sets per cell. Thus, the correct answer is 46.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. While diet, intelligence, coaching, and motivation are important factors in sports success, they do not solely determine it. The most critical elements that can be controlled through practice and training are an athlete's innate ability and their capacity to respond effectively to the training stimulus.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports requires not only physical training but also mental acuity and the drive to excel. High intelligence allows for strategic thinking and quick decision-making, while motivation fuels perseverance and dedication. Although a good coach can significantly impact performance, innate ability combined with responsiveness to training is fundamental in achieving success.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario describes a situation where the presence of chocolate chip cookies influences people to take an alternative route, which is longer due to avoidance of stairs. This aligns with the concept of 'Tyranny of choice', where too many options can lead individuals to make decisions that are not necessarily in their best interest or most efficient.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of the cookies introduces an additional choice for the participants, potentially overwhelming them with options and leading to a state of decision fatigue. This scenario aligns with the concept of 'tyranny of choice', where too many choices can lead to decreased satisfaction and poorer decisions.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups refer to non-protein components that are tightly bound to an enzyme, often playing a crucial role in the enzyme's function. They are not loosely bound like some cofactors and do not serve as allosteric sites for modification of activity. Therefore, prosthetic groups must be tightly bound to enzymes and necessary for their catalytic activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are often small organic molecules that assist enzymes in their function. These molecules are typically held in place by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, allowing for flexibility and dynamic binding. However, the defining characteristic of prosthetic groups is not just their loose attachment but rather their necessity for the catalytic activity of certain enzymes. Therefore, option D best describes prosthetic groups.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The descending loop of Henle is a part of the nephron in kidneys that plays a crucial role in concentrating urine and conserving water. It allows for passive reabsorption of water back into the bloodstream, which helps to concentrate the urine. Therefore, it's permeable primarily to water (H2O).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The descending loop of Henle is primarily responsible for concentrating the filtrate by reabsorbing water. Potassium ions are also involved in maintaining the osmotic balance within the nephron, making them likely to be permeable in this region. However, it's specifically known that the descending loop of Henle is highly permeable to water (H2O), which aids in concentrating urine.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sharp rise in membrane potential indicates depolarization, which is the process of making the inside of a neuron more positive compared to its resting state. Since there was no response initially but a similar response occurred after increasing voltage for the second stimulation, it suggests that the neurons were not at their peak excitability and needed additional energy (voltage) to reach depolarization again. Therefore, the second shock would be characterized as 'Depolarization'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sharp rise in membrane potential indicates depolarization. The subsequent lack of response to the second stimulation suggests that the neurons have returned to their resting state, which is characteristic of repolarization. However, when an increased voltage causes a similar response as the first stimulus, it implies that the neuron has not fully recovered and remains in a depolarized state. Therefore, the second shock would be characterized by depolarization.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process where ribosomes synthesize proteins using mRNA as a template. Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the codons in the mRNA sequence. Therefore, for translation to occur, we need mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation involves the decoding of mRNA into a protein sequence. This process requires mRNA as the template, ribosomes as the site of protein synthesis, and RNA polymerase to facilitate the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. Therefore, the correct answer is 'mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.'",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. The rate limiting enzyme of this pathway determines its overall pace. Among the options given, phosphofructokinase (PFK) plays a key regulatory role by catalyzing one of the early steps in glycolysis and is subject to allosteric regulation. Therefore, PFK is considered the rate limiting enzyme.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate-limiting step in glycolysis is the conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorylase. This step controls the overall rate of glycolysis and ensures a steady supply of glucose for energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is phosphorylase.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for muscle contractions, and it can be rapidly depleted during high-intensity exercise due to its limited stores within the muscle cells. The correct duration that ATP can supply energy in such conditions is relatively short. Among the options provided, 2 seconds (B) best represents this time frame.",B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP stores in muscles are limited but can be rapidly replenished through various metabolic pathways. This allows for sustained high-intensity exercise for approximately 20 seconds before other energy sources become dominant. Therefore, the correct answer is that the ATP store in muscle can supply energy during high intensity exercise for about 20 seconds.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer, helping to neutralize acid in the body and maintain an optimal pH level during exercise. This can delay fatigue and improve performance in middle-distance running events. The correct answer is that sodium bicarbonate ingestion elevates the pH and buffering capacity of extracellular fluid, allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer, helping to maintain the pH balance within the muscles. By elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH, it provides a greater capacity to neutralize the acidic byproducts of exercise, delaying fatigue. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate ingestion improves middle distance running performance primarily through this mechanism.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of an object on an inclined plane is influenced by gravity, the angle of incline, and friction. The component of gravitational force acting down the slope is g sin(?), while the frictional force opposes this motion as \u00b5g cos(?). Therefore, the net acceleration would be the difference between these two forces: a = g (sin(?)- \u00b5cos(?)).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of the object is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it down the incline and the frictional force opposing its motion. This can be represented as the difference between the sine and cosine components of the gravitational force, leading to the expression a = g (sin ? - cos ?). Therefore, option B is correct.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. While protein intake, creatine, and amino acids all play roles in muscle development, the statement that directly links a supplement to increased strength and power is most accurate. Creatine supplementation has been widely studied and shown to enhance these aspects of physical performance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage typically occurs during intense exercise, especially when muscles are forced to contract while lengthening. This type of contraction, known as an eccentric contraction, places greater stress on the muscle fibers, leading to microscopic tears and subsequent muscle damage. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin, which allows it to effectively extract oxygen from the mother's bloodstream in utero. If an individual retains this form of hemoglobin into adulthood, they would have increased oxygen binding capacity at the tissue level due to fetal hemoglobin's higher affinity for oxygen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. This allows for efficient transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetus during pregnancy. Retaining fetal hemoglobin into adulthood would therefore result in significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs. Hence, the correct answer is 'significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs.'",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound found in muscle cells, which serves as an immediate reserve of energy for the rapid regeneration of ATP during intense physical activity. It is predominantly located within the sarcoplasm, or cytoplasm, of muscle fibers. Therefore, among the given options, phosphocreatine in muscle cells is found in the cytoplasm.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity exercise. It is primarily located within the mitochondria, where it can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP to fuel muscle contractions. Therefore, among the given options, phosphocreatine in the muscle cell is found in the mitochondria.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the absence of oxygen, cells switch to anaerobic respiration or fermentation, which results in less efficient ATP production and accumulation of lactate. Among the options given, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is directly related to cellular energy supply, and its production would be immediately affected when oxygen is not supplied as it's primarily produced through aerobic respiration. Therefore, the molecule that will stop being produced first in this scenario is ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in cellular respiration and is produced during glycolysis, which can occur both with and without oxygen. When oxygen is no longer available, pyruvate production will cease as the cell switches to anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, among the given options, pyruvate (B) would stop being produced first in the absence of oxygen.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of a cell refers to its overall ability to store and utilize energy, particularly in relation to ATP (adenosine triphosphate) levels. It is not about the difference between charges or specific enzymes but rather the state of adenine nucleotides within the cell. Therefore, the correct answer is that it represents the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of the cell refers to the balance of ions, particularly sodium and potassium, across the cell membrane. This balance is maintained by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which actively pumps ions against their concentration gradients, generating an electrical potential difference. However, this does not directly represent the energy charge itself but rather a mechanism that contributes to it. The correct answer reflects the overall phosphorylation state of adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, AMP) within the cell, which is indicative of its energy status.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Substance abuse during adolescence can lead to long-term changes in brain structure, particularly affecting the prefrontal cortex which is responsible for executive functions such as decision making and impulse control. This aligns with option I. While substance abuse may increase susceptibility to various psychological symptoms, auditory hallucinations are not directly linked to diminished executive functioning but rather to other conditions like schizophrenia. Therefore, the most likely true statements for this patient would be pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex and reduced behavioral impulse control.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Substance abuse can have detrimental effects on brain development, particularly in regions associated with executive functions. This impairment often manifests as increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations, as the brain struggles to filter and interpret sensory information accurately. Additionally, substance abuse is known to affect behavioral control due to altered prefrontal cortex functioning. Therefore, both I and III are likely true of this patient.",C
