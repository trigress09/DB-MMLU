A,"Let's reason step by step. A proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal. To determine which ratio cannot form a proportion with 8/18, we can simplify each option and compare it to the simplified form of 8/18 (which is 4/9). Upon simplification, options B (3/9), C (2/3), and D (4/9) are equivalent or close to this ratio. However, when simplified, option A (28/54) does not equal 4/9, making it the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We can simplify the ratio 8 over 18 to 4 over 9, so any ratio that simplifies to 4 over 9 will form a proportion with 8 over 18. Upon examining each option, we find that only 'D: 4 over 9' simplifies to this same ratio and therefore forms a proportion with 8/18.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The initial price of the stock is $24.75. Over five days, it gained and lost certain amounts: +$2.50 on Monday, -$3.25 on Tuesday, -$0.75 on Wednesday, +$1.25 on Thursday, and +$4.75 on Friday. Adding these changes to the initial price gives us $29.25 as the final price at the end of Friday.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

The calculation results in a net increase of $9.00 from the initial price of $24.75, making the final price $33.75.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for information needed to compare the proportion of students who ate lunch in each class, not the actual quantity consumed or when it was eaten. To make an accurate comparison between 0.5 (or 50%) of Mr. Paulson\u2019s class that ate pizza and Ms. Hugo's class where 0.5 ate hamburgers, we need to know the total number of students in each class because this will allow us to understand what portion of the whole class these numbers represent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since both classes have the same proportion of students eating a specific food, we can directly compare them without any additional information. The key is to understand what '0.5' represents in this context - it indicates that half of each class had pizza or hamburgers for lunch. Therefore, no further data about the day, total number of slices, or students are needed.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. A hexagon has six sides, an octagon has eight, and a parallelogram is defined as having two pairs of parallel sides but not necessarily equal angles or side lengths. Squares are indeed rhombi with all sides equal in length, but not all rhombi have this property. Therefore, the correct statement is that all rhombi are squares because they have four sides that are all the same length.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A hexagon has 6 sides, which is more than the 3 sides required for a triangle, so all hexagons must be triangles. However, this statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the properties of these shapes. An octagon does have at least 3 sides and is indeed a polygon, but that doesn't make all octagons polygons as they are already classified as such. Parallelograms do have two sets of parallel sides, but not all parallelograms are rectangles since rectangles require right angles which parallelograms don't necessarily possess. Rhombi have four equal-length sides, but unlike squares, their angles aren't required to be 90 degrees. Therefore, the correct statement is that all rhombi are not squares.",D

The remainder is the number that is left over after dividing, so in this case, the remainder of 21 divided by 7 is 21. However, since we are looking for a single digit remainder and 21 can be evenly divided by 7 with no remainder, the correct answer should reflect this fact.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The equation given is 8y = 56, and we need to find the value of y using mental math. By dividing both sides of the equation by 8, we get y = 7. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a number that, when added to 8, gives us 56. Since 8 + 48 equals 56, the value of y must be 48. However, this option is not available in the choices provided. The closest correct answer using mental math would be dividing both sides by 8, which results in y = 7.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure a random sample, Wendy should aim to include students from various backgrounds and interests without bias. Selecting ten students from each homeroom would provide the most diverse representation of the student body as it includes all grades and classes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure the survey reflects the preferences of the entire school, it's best to choose participants who already like Wendy's favorite flavor, as they are more likely to participate and provide accurate feedback. However, this method could introduce bias since these students might have similar tastes. Among the given options, selecting ten students from each homeroom is a systematic approach that can help in achieving a random sample if done correctly.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the mean, we add all numbers in the set and divide by the count of numbers. Adding 18+9+9+10+11+14+30+19 gives us a total of 120. There are 8 numbers in this data set. Dividing 120 by 8, we get 15 as the mean.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the central tendency of the data, we need to identify the most frequent value. In this set, the number 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number. However, when calculating the mean (average), all values are considered equally. Adding up all numbers and dividing by the count gives us a mean of 15.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To estimate the sum to the nearest tenth, we round each number first: 27.94 rounds to 28 and 15.35 rounds to 15.3. Adding these rounded numbers gives us an estimated sum of 43.3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 27.94 down gives us 27, and rounding 15.35 down gives us 15. Adding these rounded numbers, we get 27 + 15 = 42. Since the original decimals were close to .4 each, when added together they approximate .8. Therefore, adding this estimated sum (42) and the decimal (.8), we estimate the total as approximately 43.2.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime factors. The prime factors of 48 are 2 and 3, with 2 being used more frequently than 3 in the multiplication process. Specifically, 48 can be expressed as 2^4 multiplied by 3 once (since 2^4 equals 16 and 16 times 3 equals 48). Therefore, the correct prime factorization of 48 is represented by option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can break down 48 into 4 multiplied by 8, as 4 times 8 equals 48. These two numbers are factors of 48. However, neither 4 nor 8 is a prime number. The correct prime factorization involves breaking down the composite numbers further until only primes remain. For 4 (which is 2^2), and 8 (which is 2^3), we can combine them to get 2^5 or 2^3 * 2^2, which simplifies to 2^3 * 2^2 = 2^5. However, this option isn't listed correctly in the choices provided. The correct prime factorization of 48 is actually 2^4 \u00d7 3^1 (or simply written as 2^4 \u2022 3). Therefore, the closest and most accurate answer from the given options is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. To simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of both numerator and denominator. The GCD of 60 and 72 is 12. Dividing both numbers by 12 gives us 5 over 6.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both 60 and 72 are divisible by 6. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6, we get 10 over 12 as the simplified fraction. Therefore, the simplest form of '60 over 72' is '10 over 12'.",B
