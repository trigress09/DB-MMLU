C,"Let's reason step by step. Herbert Spencer, in the given passage, emphasizes on individual freedom and responsibility while acknowledging that certain hardships are part of a larger benevolent plan for humanity. This aligns with liberalism which advocates for personal liberty and limited government intervention. Therefore, based on this context, it can be inferred that Spencer was an advocate of Liberalism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's strong opposition to government involvement in social welfare and his focus on individual liberty suggest a belief in minimal state control, aligning with anarchist principles. However, the emphasis on universal humanity hints at a more liberal perspective that values collective well-being while still advocating for personal freedom.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Morris's disdain for modern civilization, its wasteful use of mechanical power, and the resulting poverty and destruction of art. He also mentions his hope in socialism as a solution to these issues. Therefore, it can be inferred that by 1896, Morris had dedicated himself to the triumph of socialism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's disdain for the negative consequences of industrialization and his embrace of socialism suggest a vision of a society with advanced mechanical power driving progress. However, he specifically mentions 'its supplanting by Socialism,' indicating that his dedication was to the triumph of socialism as an alternative system.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase ""negotiations with the Tories"" refers to political parties in Britain, where 'Tories' is an old term for Conservatives. Given that Queen Victoria was reigning during this period and considering the historical context of British politics, it suggests a transition from one dominant party to another. In this case, the most appropriate answer would be the switch from a liberal-dominated to a conservative-dominated Parliament.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to negotiations with the Tories and Queen Victoria's active involvement in political discussions suggest a transition towards a more female-centric political landscape. However, during this period, politics were still male-dominated. Therefore, none of the options directly relate to the historical context provided. But considering the era (1837-1843), it's unlikely that there was any significant shift in gender dynamics within politics at that time.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Hernan Cortez highlights the importance of superior technologies in their conquest, specifically mentioning new sailing technologies like the compass and astrolabe which were crucial for navigation during long voyages across uncharted waters to the New World.",A,"Let's reason step by step. European dominance in exploration was largely facilitated by superior shipbuilding technology, enabling them to navigate vast distances and establish trade routes with the New World. The carrack and caravel were specifically designed for long sea voyages, making option B the most crucial factor.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union, is a non-aggression pact that also included secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. This agreement shares similarities with the Munich Agreement (1938), which was another attempt to avoid conflict through diplomatic means by allowing Nazi Germany's annexation of parts of Czechoslovakia, albeit in a different context and time period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The agreement's focus on preventing conflict between Germany and the USSR through non-aggression resembles the appeasement strategy employed in the Munich Agreement to avoid war with Germany. Therefore, it is most similar to the Munich Agreement (1938).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Article III states that territories lying west of a certain line, which formerly belonged to Russia, will no longer be under its sovereignty and this line is determined by a Russo-German commission. This indicates the transfer of territory from Russian control to German control in the west. Therefore, the correct answer is the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's stipulations regarding territories previously under Russian control and the establishment of a Russo-German commission suggest a transfer of land from the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. Therefore, the correct answer is that Article III resulted in the surrender of the western part of the Russian Empire to the German Empire.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation highlights that after 1848, nothing remained but 'the idea of Force', indicating a shift away from liberal and conservative ideas. This suggests that the revolution failed to bring about change in these ideologies, making option C - 'the discrediting of both conservative and liberal political ideology' - the most appropriate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's emphasis on the revolutions' failure to bring about significant change suggests that the existing power structures and ruling class remained largely unaffected, despite the upheaval. However, he specifically mentions how both conservative and liberal ideas were discredited as a result of the failed revolution. Therefore, the most important effect according to Taylor was the discrediting of these political ideologies.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Candide, written by Voltaire during the French Enlightenment period, showcases a satirical and critical view of optimistic philosophy through Pangloss' unwavering belief in 'the best possible world'. This aligns with Rationalism, which emphasizes reason as the primary source of knowledge. The passage does not directly relate to Medievalism, Empiricism, or Romanticism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pangloss's reliance on personal anecdotes and his persistent belief in the inherent goodness of the world, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, reflect an empirical approach to understanding reality. He insists that everything happens for the best based on his experiences, which aligns with the principles of Empiricism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin emphasized the need for industrial development to ensure national defense and socialist construction, which implies a focus on agricultural modernization. Among the options provided, collectivization (A) and five-year plans (D) were policies implemented by Stalin that aimed at transforming agriculture into large-scale production. The Berlin blockade (C) was an event during World War II unrelated to Lenin's concerns about industrial development in Russia. Persecution of the better-off peasants (B), however, did not directly address the issue of modernizing agriculture and is more associated with Stalin's class struggle tactics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Collectivization, involving the forced consolidation of small farms into larger collective units, was not a strategy employed by Stalin to address the issues of agricultural inefficiency and backwardness. Instead, it led to widespread famine and hardship among peasants. The other options listed were policies implemented during Stalin's rule that aimed at industrializing the Soviet Union and improving its economic foundation.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The encomienda system was a labor system that granted Spanish settlers control over indigenous people for labor and tribute, but it faced criticism due to abuses of forced labor. However, the end of this system wasn't directly caused by protests from Catholic missionaries (A), lack of new land (B), or an increase in mestizos forbidden from working on encomiendas (D). The Spanish royal crown did seek more direct control over estates, which led to reforms and the eventual end of the system. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The encomienda system's gradual decline can be attributed primarily to the Spanish crown's increasing desire to exert direct control over the American colonies and their resources, bypassing the intermediary encomenderos. This shift in governance aimed at reducing abuses and improving administration is well-documented historically. Therefore, the correct answer is that it was not ended due to an increase in mestizos forbidden from working on encomiendas.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the idea that if civilized education allowed children to follow their natural inclinations towards plebeian occupations, wealthy children would likely pursue these trades. Fourier is mentioned as having proposed this concept in his work 'On Education'. This aligns with the principles of utopian socialism, which advocates for a society where individuals can freely choose their occupation based on personal inclination and communal benefit. Therefore, Fourier belongs to the group of Utopian Socialists.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fourier's belief in the importance of individual passions and his critique of societal restrictions on personal fulfillment suggest an affinity for laissez-faire capitalism, which promotes individual liberty and minimal government interference. However, his focus on reforming society to better align with human nature indicates a more socialist perspective.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the spherical nature of celestial bodies and the earth, as well as the movement of these bodies in relation to each other. It mentions that most authors agree with a geocentric model (earth at the center), but also considers alternative perspectives. Copernicus' work is known for challenging this view by proposing a heliocentric model, which aligns more closely with Platonic and Pythagorean traditions that emphasize mathematical harmony in the universe.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's emphasis on the Earth's spherical shape and his exploration of the possibility of a heliocentric model align with the Aristotelian tradition, which provided the foundation for understanding the natural world. However, he challenged some aspects of this tradition, such as the idea that the Earth is at the center of the universe. Despite these challenges, Copernicus's work was still rooted in the philosophical and scientific ideas prevalent during his time.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bartholomew de las Casas in Source 2 describes the Spanish actions towards indigenous people as brutal and focused on acquiring gold for wealth, rather than religious conversion or personal glory. This aligns with his later writings where he criticizes the exploitation of natives for material gain by the Spaniards. Therefore, de las Casas most likely views financial gain as the primary motive in Source 2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas's strong criticism of Spanish cruelty and his depiction of the suffering inflicted upon the indigenous population suggest a belief that the primary motive for exploration was to find new mates for the Spanish colonists. This is supported by his mentioning of 'ravening wolves upon the fold' which implies an aggressive pursuit, likely driven by personal desires rather than religious or financial ones.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The year 1945 marks the end of World War II, a significant event in global history that shaped international relations and ideologies. Taylor's analysis written during this period would likely be influenced by the recent events and their impact on German history. Therefore, it is important to note that he was writing at the end of World War II as it could have led him to explore connections between past events and contemporary issues such as perceived German belligerence or the origins of the Cold War.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's analysis of the 1848 revolutions, written in the context of 1945 and the aftermath of World War II, suggests a focus on understanding the origins of the Cold War and the ideological conflicts that shaped the post-war world. This historical perspective is crucial for comprehending the long-term impacts of past events on subsequent global developments.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed between Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey) during World War I. This treaty marked Russia's exit from the war to focus on internal issues following the Bolshevik Revolution. The most accurate description of its result is that it was a consequence of the Bolsheviks needing to end the Russian war effort in order to consolidate their revolutionary gains.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, involving Russia and Germany, can be seen as a direct consequence of the fracturing of the Triple Entente, as alliances shifted and power dynamics changed during World War I. This treaty marked Russia's exit from the war to focus on internal issues, but it was primarily due to the breakdown of their former alliance with France and Britain.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the shift from a positive to negative view of Germany having a unique mission, which is attributed to its deviation from Western nations post-1945. This implies that the belief was discredited due to this deviation and not directly because of World War II itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of Germany having a unique historical mission emerged in response to the nation's defeat in World War II, as Germans sought to explain their country's trajectory and its deviation from the West. However, the passage indicates that this belief is now largely discredited due to the realization that no country has followed what can be described as a 'normal path.' Therefore, Germany's unique mission in history was discredited by its defeat in World War II.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Napoleon's 1802 diary entry, he emphasizes that his power is derived from his reputation built on victories won through conquest. He states that without continued military successes and glory, his power would diminish. This directly aligns with option A, which suggests that Napoleon feared losing power if he did not continue to win military victories.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's relentless pursuit of conquest and his focus on maintaining his reputation suggest a primary motivation to earn the admiration and loyalty of his soldiers, who played a crucial role in his military successes. This is best reflected in option D, which highlights his appreciation for his soldiers' efforts.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The document mentions Metternich's emphasis on unity between monarchs and their role in maintaining justice, truth, and religious principles. This aligns with the concept of a collective European effort to preserve stability post-Napoleonic Wars. Therefore, it refers to the creation of the Concert of Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's strong opposition to secret societies and his emphasis on maintaining social order directly resulted in the implementation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which aimed to suppress revolutionary movements and dissent. The other options do not align with the specific reference made in the document.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt highlights Napoleon's intellectual prowess, his conversations on various subjects, and how they invigorate minds. However, it does not directly mention any specific actions he took to make the French Revolution an international movement in the areas he conquered. Among the given choices, abolishing feudalism and manorialism (C) is a significant change that could have had wide-reaching effects on societal structures within his territories, potentially contributing to the spread of revolutionary ideas.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's conquests and the subsequent dissemination of French language and culture throughout Europe played a significant role in making the French Revolution an international movement, spreading its ideals and principles to other nations. Among the given options, encouraging the use of French as the universal language (D) aligns best with this historical context.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's speech emphasizes the need for industrialization in order to defend the country, develop socialist industry, and prevent a return to capitalism. The context of World War I is also mentioned as an event that highlighted Russia's vulnerability due to its lack of industrial development. Therefore, it can be inferred that Lenin was influenced by the humiliating defeat in WWI which made him realize the importance of industrialization for national defense and stability.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Trotsky's strategic control over vital infrastructure, such as rail and telegraph stations, during the Bolshevik Revolution heavily influenced Lenin's focus on industrialization as a means to strengthen the Soviet state and maintain power. This is evident from Lenin's emphasis on developing socialist industry and transitioning agriculture towards large-scale production in his speech.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Doregel\u00e8s as being 'exhilarated' upon hearing Parisians singing in response to news of mobilization for war, indicating a positive reaction rather than fear or doubt. Therefore, the most appropriate inference is that he shared Paris's excitement about the advent of war.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Doregelès mentions being 'dead tired but exhilarated,' which suggests a sense of nervous energy and worry about the potential consequences of war. However, he also states that Paris is singing, indicating excitement rather than fear or disgust. Among the given options, none directly expresses this mix of emotions. Nevertheless, option C seems to be the closest in capturing Doregel\u00e8s's likely concern about his city being excited about war.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that Henry IV ordained for the restoration of the Catholic Apostolic and Roman religion, allowing Catholics to live peacefully without religious compulsion. This indicates his decision was in favor of coexistence rather than banning or declaring one true Church. Therefore, the correct answer is that he decided the Catholic Church should exist in France.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Henry IV's edict clearly states the restoration of the Catholic Church, implying its superior position and truth compared to other religions. The passage does not suggest banning or causing trouble for the church but rather promoting peaceful coexistence with other religious groups. Therefore, the most accurate inference is that Henry IV decided the Catholic Church should exist in France.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Luddite Song from Source 2 describes the actions of cropper lads, who were workers protesting against industrialization and its impact on their livelihoods. Before 1850, there was limited government intervention in addressing these problems directly related to industrialization. Therefore, the best description is that governments did little to address problems of industrialization before 1850.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The government's response to industrialization issues often involved establishing social safety nets like healthcare systems to support displaced workers. However, before 1850, the primary focus was on addressing immediate concerns related to labor and industry rather than creating comprehensive national health-care systems. Therefore, option D is not the best description of governmental reactions during this period.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' portrays the British imperial mission as a duty to civilize and uplift colonized peoples, despite its challenges. However, it also implies that this task is fraught with difficulties and potential failure due to the negative consequences mentioned in the last stanza. Therefore, option 'A: a difficult but necessary task' best encapsulates Kipling's conception of the British imperial mission.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem uses phrases like 'heavy harness' and 'sullen peoples,' indicating a belief in the need for forceful control and dominance over colonized populations. The line 'Watch sloth and heathen Folly bring all your hopes to naught.' suggests that failure is expected due to inherent weaknesses of those being controlled. Thus, Kipling's conception can be best summed up as a ruthless exercise of power.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The documents provided discuss the impact of industrial machinery on wool production, specifically mentioning how these machines reduced manual labor but also caused alarm among workers initially. However, none of the options directly refer to outcomes mentioned in the documents or known historical consequences of the Industrial Revolution. Among the given choices, option D is clearly not a result of the Industrial Revolution as it suggests greater social and economic equity emerged due to increased income equality between workers and bosses, which contradicts the well-documented widening wealth gap during this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The formation of class identities through labor unions and shared experiences fostered a sense of solidarity and ultimately led to a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. However, the Industrial Revolution was characterized by significant social and economic disparities between workers and bosses, with incomes becoming less equal rather than more.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the idea that poverty and distress are natural outcomes of human actions, suggesting a belief in survival of the fittest. This aligns with Social Darwinism, which applies the concept of 'survival of the fittest' to societies and social structures. Therefore, Herbert Spencer advocated for Social Darwinism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's argument against government intervention in poverty aligns with social conservatism's emphasis on individual responsibility and minimal state interference. However, the concept of 'survival of the fittest' as applied to human society suggests a belief that societal progress is driven by natural selection, which is characteristic of Social Darwinism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how opinions on Germany's historical trajectory have shifted over time, from an initial positive view to the current predominant negative one. This indicates that there has been a longstanding debate in Germany about whether it followed a unique path in history or not.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Winkler states that the negative view of a unique German path is now predominant, suggesting a settled consensus and an end to the debate. However, he also mentions there was a time when educated Germans held different views on this matter. Therefore, it can be inferred that there has been a longstanding debate in Germany about the existence of a unique German path in history.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that educated Germans initially claimed a special 'German mission', which implies belief in something distinctive about Germany. However, it also states this view changed after 1945 when the negative opinion prevailed. Therefore, prior to 1945, there was significant belief in a unique German mission.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that educated Germans began criticizing the deviation from the West after 1945 suggests that there was little belief in a unique German path before that time. This implies that prior to 1945, most people did not hold this view.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Elie Wiesel emphasizes that it is not about judging the current generation but holding them responsible for how they remember and act upon past events, specifically mentioning Auschwitz. This implies a focus on remembrance rather than guilt or shared responsibility for historical actions. Therefore, the correct answer is that he believed the current generation of Germans had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wiesel clearly states that the current generation of Germans should not be judged for the crimes of the past, implying they have no responsibility regarding the Holocaust. However, he emphasizes the importance of remembering and dealing with the memory of the past to prevent further trauma. Therefore, the correct answer is that Wiesel believed the current generation had a responsibility to remember the Holocaust.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt praises Napoleon for his genius, knowledge, and conversations on various subjects that concern humanity. It does not mention any criticism or hypocrisy in these aspects of his life. However, the invasion of Haiti to stop a slave revolt is an action often criticized as being driven by racism and imperialistic motives rather than high mindedness. Therefore, this seems to be the action that the author ignores when discussing Napoleon's praiseworthiness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author praises Napoleon's intellect and achievements, which likely includes his successful expansion of French influence through conquests and the Continental System. However, these actions are often criticized for their hypocrisy due to Napoleon's own role in perpetuating slavery during his invasion of Haiti. The other options (A, B, C) do not directly relate to the author's focus on Napoleon's high mindedness and praiseworthiness.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The document criticizes the actions and intentions of the Chartists, a group known for advocating political reforms such as universal male suffrage. However, it does not necessarily imply that Francis Place himself is against radical reformers; instead, he expresses concerns about certain aspects of their methods. Therefore, the best characterization would be that the author believes in universal male suffrage but has reservations about some Chartists' tactics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The author's disapproval of the Chartists' violent tactics and extreme rhetoric indicates agreement with their radical reformist objectives. However, Francis Place's criticism is not against being a radical reformer but rather specific actions taken by some Chartists. Therefore, option B is incorrect as it implies that criticizing the Chartists equates to being a radical reformer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Operation Barbarossa was a military invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany in 1941, which directly violated the Neutrality Agreement between the two nations. According to Article I, both parties agreed not to engage in any aggressive action against each other. Therefore, the article that was violated is Article I.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Operation Barbarossa, as a surprise attack, represents a failure to maintain contact and exchange information as stipulated in Article III of the pact. This article emphasizes on consultation for common interests which was not followed during this event.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the influence of Byzantine scholarship and Plato on Western philosophy, particularly during the Renaissance period when humanists were studying antiquity. Among the options given, 'Utopia' is a work that reflects Platonic ideals and was written by Thomas More in 1516, which aligns with the cultural diffusion described by Bertrand Russell.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of Platonism during the Renaissance, as described by Russell, likely influenced the development of literary works like Boccaccio's Decameron. This work reflects humanist values and a focus on individual experience, which align with Platonic ideals. Therefore, the cultural diffusion mentioned most directly influenced 'The Decameron'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation discusses how Christians, despite being historically intolerant, should inspire more tolerance according to Voltaire. This suggests that he saw tolerance as a value worth promoting, aligning with the principles of the Enlightenment era which emphasized reason and individualism over tradition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of Christian intolerance suggests a rejection of religion altogether, aligning with atheistic beliefs. However, the primary focus is on tolerance as an Enlightenment value, which he advocates for in his letter to King Louis XV.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union, was a non-aggression treaty that included secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Among these territories, Poland was explicitly mentioned as falling within the Soviet sphere. This agreement allowed both nations to freely invade Poland without conflict with each other.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's emphasis on peace between Germany and the USSR implies permission for both nations to pursue expansionist policies in other regions, such as Finland. However, it was specifically Poland that they invaded shortly after signing this pact, which is a direct violation of their agreement not to attack each other or support third-party aggression.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a situation where the conquistador, Cort\u00e9s, demands gold from his men and threatens severe punishment for non-compliance. This behavior is similar to that of Francisco Pizarro who also sought wealth through conquest in South America. Therefore, the motivations described are most similar to those of Francisco Pizarro.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors, like Bartholomew Dias, were primarily driven by a thirst for exploration and the desire to discover new lands and trade routes. However, the text specifically mentions Cortés' actions in Mexico, which align more closely with Francisco Pizarro's conquest of Peru where he also sought wealth through gold extraction and imposed tributes on indigenous people. Therefore, the motivations described are most similar to those of Francisco Pizarro.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpts from John Calvin's works highlight differences in views on predestination and election between Calvinists and Lutherans. Calvinists emphasize God's sovereign choice in salvation, while Lutherans focus more on individual faith and the priesthood of all believers. Among the choices given, option D best represents this contrast as it refers to differences in sacramental practices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The key distinction between Calvinists and Lutherans lies in their political goals, with Lutherans using their faith to challenge the authority of the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. This contrasts with Calvinist beliefs on predestination and election, which are not directly related to state-religion dynamics or sacramental practices.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote discusses observations of the Medicean planets, which are Mercury, Venus, and Earth as seen from Jupiter (considered in a heliocentric model). This aligns with Nicolaus Copernicus's heliocentric theory that was proposed before Galileo. Therefore, it is most likely that the ideas of Copernicus influenced Galileo to write this statement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's groundbreaking discoveries and observations regarding Jupiter's moons were likely the result of his own independent thinking and scientific brilliance. However, it was Nicolaus Copernicus who proposed the heliocentric model that placed the Sun at the center of the universe, which directly influenced Galileo's work on planetary motion. Therefore, among the given options, Nicolaus Copernicus is the most likely Polish thinker to have inspired Galileo.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Renaissance was characterized by a shift from reliance on ancient authorities to empirical evidence and experimentation, particularly in natural philosophy. Among the options provided, 'Aristotle' is not an intellectual hallmark but rather an ancient philosopher whose ideas were often questioned during this period. Therefore, the correct answer that represents an intellectual hallmark conflicting with Aristotle's approach would be his name itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The focus on artistic creativity and expression during the Renaissance stood in contrast to the scientific spirit of questioning established knowledge and conducting experiments. Among the options, 'Aristotle', which is a reference to Aristotelian philosophy rather than an intellectual hallmark, can be eliminated as it doesn't fit into the context. Humanism emphasizes human values and achievements but does not directly conflict with scientific inquiry. Secularism separates religious from secular matters, potentially allowing for questioning of ancient philosophies without religious constraints. Individualism promotes personal independence and self-reliance, which aligns well with experimental investigation. However, the most direct intellectual hallmark in conflict would be 'Aristotelian' thinking itself, as it represents a traditional approach that Galileo challenged through his empirical methods.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were a set of decrees adopted by Germanic states in 1819, aimed at suppressing liberal and nationalist ideas that threatened the unity and stability of the confederation. Among the options provided, the dissolution of the union (C) is most directly related to the fears expressed in these resolutions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The German states' implementation of press restrictions and university regulations suggests a primary concern with the resurgence of Bonapartism and potential external threats. This is further supported by historical context, as Napoleon was invading Europe at that time. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be support for Bonapartism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 2, de las Casas describes the brutal treatment of indigenous people by Spanish explorers and their relentless pursuit of gold as a primary motive for their actions. This aligns with the concept of exploitation for financial gain. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that de las Casas criticizes 'Financial gain' as the motive for exploration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas is clearly outraged by the Spaniards' actions and their mistreatment of the natives, particularly their forceful attempts to convert them to Christianity. However, he emphasizes that the primary motive for these explorations was not religious conversion but rather acquiring gold and wealth. This aligns with his description of the Spanish aiming to 'swell themselves with riches in a very brief time.' Therefore, the answer is financial gain.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes man's fortunate position and his ability to choose any form he desires, highlighting a unique aspect of humanity. This aligns with the idea that humans have unlimited potential. Therefore, option D is the most fitting answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola emphasizes the special status of humans compared to other creatures, highlighting the divine gift of a soul that allows them to choose their own path. However, he specifically mentions 'the nature of all other beings is limited,' suggesting that it's not just about having a soul but also about transcending these limitations. The most fitting inference from his statement would be humanity's unique potential for self-determination and growth.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Marx and Engels, the bourgeoisie and proletariat are two classes with inherent class antagonisms due to economic changes. They argue that these conflicts arise from fundamental economic transformations rather than being avoidable or repeating historical patterns. Therefore, an all-out war between them would be seen as an inevitable result of such change.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels believed in historical patterns repeating themselves, with class struggles being a recurring theme throughout different epochs, leading to inevitable conflicts like the one between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. However, their view was that this conflict is not merely repetitive but also driven by fundamental economic changes. Therefore, an all-out war between these classes would be seen as an 'inevitable result of fundamental economic change'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text highlights various institutions and opportunities available to anthropologists during the Paris Exposition, such as museums, laboratories, lectures, collections, and hospitals. These facilities suggest a focus on specialized fields within anthropology rather than general changes in society or funding. Therefore, it can be inferred that at the time of the Paris Exposition, the scientific community was changing due to the development of new, specialized fields.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the growing interest in understanding human origins and diversity, suggesting a shift towards universal education as a means to study and categorize different populations. However, it does not directly mention women or funding from French officials. Instead, it emphasizes various institutions providing opportunities for researchers, which implies an expansion of specialized fields within anthropology.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the British Empire's view on their colonies as 'half-devil and half-child', indicating that they saw these native peoples as uncivilized or less developed compared to themselves. This aligns with option D, which states that the natives are seen as products of a less civilized and less developed civilization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem portrays the native peoples as 'half-devil and half-child,' suggesting they are in need of guidance and salvation through Christian teachings. However, it also emphasizes their potential to fight for peace despite being labeled as savage. Among the given options, option C most accurately reflects this portrayal by acknowledging that these peoples are seen as ready for conversion to Christianity.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The two excerpts describe contrasting interactions between Spaniards and indigenous people in the Americas during different periods of colonization. Source 1, written by Columbus, depicts a more diplomatic approach initially, while Source 2, from de las Casas, portrays later brutal treatment. The best explanation for these differences is that over time, as Spanish expeditions continued and the pursuit of gold intensified, their methods became increasingly violent and exploitative.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The two accounts differ because Columbus's initial interactions with the natives were peaceful and focused on trade, while later expeditions led by other Spaniards turned violent and exploitative. This shift in behavior can be attributed to changing objectives of the Spanish conquistadors over time, as they sought wealth through conquest rather than trade. Therefore, option C best accounts for these differences.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, a prominent Enlightenment thinker, criticizes persecution in his quote following the Lisbon earthquake. His criticism aligns with challenges to the authority and monopoly on truth held by the Roman Catholic Church during that period. Therefore, it is most likely influenced by these challenges.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of persecution stems from the Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and legal equality, advocating for tolerance and respect for different beliefs and practices. This aligns with philosophical ideas proposed by thinkers like Locke and Rousseau who championed these concepts. Therefore, Voltaire's statement is most likely influenced by new concepts of legal equity and individual rights expressed by Locke and Rousseau.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'concatenation of universal events' in this context refers to a series of unrelated incidents that ultimately lead to an outcome, which is the men being brought together on the ship. This reflects the Enlightenment era's tendency to seek patterns and connections across various domains of knowledge, including history, philosophy, and natural sciences. Therefore, the answer that best aligns with this concept is 'drawing universal conclusions from a wide range of concrete data'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'concatenation of universal events' refers to the interconnectedness of European empires through maritime trade and exploration, bringing people from diverse backgrounds together on ships like the one mentioned in the passage. This reflects the Enlightenment era's interest in understanding human behavior by observing cause-and-effect relationships across different cultures and societies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, in this quote, expresses his dismay at the devastating effects of natural disasters on human life and criticizes religious persecution amidst such tragedies. This reflects Enlightenment intellectuals' belief that scientific discoveries should lead to a more tolerant and objective approach towards social issues. Therefore, option D is the best answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's critique of religious institutions and dogmatism reflects the Enlightenment's rejection of religion in favor of reason and scientific inquiry, leading many intellectuals to embrace atheism. However, his emphasis on tolerance and a more objective approach towards social issues aligns with the broader characteristics of Enlightenment thinkers.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Galileo's observations and measurements of the Medicean planets (Jupiter and its moons), which were based on empirical evidence gathered through experimentation using a telescope. This approach aligns with the scientific method, where information obtained through observation and experimentation is used to conceptualize our understanding of the universe. Therefore, option C best demonstrates intellectual thought at the time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observations provided evidence for the theories of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who proposed a geocentric model of the universe with celestial bodies revolving around the Earth. However, Galileo's findings supported a heliocentric model where planets orbit the sun, contradicting some of these ancient ideas. The passage emphasizes his use of experimentation and observation to understand the universe better.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The petition describes how Scribbling-Machines are displacing traditional workers, leading to unemployment and distress among families who rely on this work for their livelihood. This situation aligns with the historical Luddite movement in Britain during the industrial revolution, which was characterized by protests against mechanization that threatened jobs of skilled laborers. Therefore, the document serves as evidence for the rise of the Luddite movement.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The petition highlights the negative consequences of industrialization, particularly the displacement of workers by machines, leading to increased child labor as families struggled to survive. However, it does not directly mention revolutionary ideas or the Luddite movement. Instead, it focuses on the impact of machinery replacing traditional laborers in Britain during this period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'the replacing of traditional laborers by machines in the industrialization of Britain in the eighteenth century.'",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine criticizes persecution and emphasizes individual rights, which aligns with Enlightenment thinkers like Locke and Rousseau who advocated for legal equity and personal freedoms. The other options do not directly relate to the context of religious freedom or criticism of institutional power as expressed in Paine's statement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's rejection of established churches is rooted in the scientific advancements of the time, particularly Newton's laws, which promoted a deterministic view of the universe and challenged religious dogmas. However, his criticism of persecution aligns more closely with Enlightenment thinkers like Locke and Rousseau who advocated for individual rights and legal equity. Thus, Paine's statement is most likely influenced by these philosophical ideas.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Huizinga, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among the people and made humanism accessible beyond the educated classes. This indicates that he valued educating the masses more than his predecessors had done. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's significant contribution was his focus on religious texts and teachings, making them more accessible to the common people and challenging the Church's monopoly on spiritual knowledge. This approach allowed a broader audience to engage with classical culture and humanist ideas, which is not explicitly mentioned in options A or B. Option C directly addresses this aspect by highlighting his focus on religious matters. Therefore, option D, emphasizing Erasmus's value for educating the masses more than his predecessors, aligns closely with Huizinga's perspective.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Italy's unification and its impact on historical connections, particularly with Rome. It mentions that 'never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome.' This implies a significant change in Italy's relationship with its history upon this event. Therefore, the answer is B: Italians liberated Rome.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that the unification of Italy and the loss of Sicily's independence represent a significant break from the country's historical traditions and regional identities. Among the options provided, the event where connections to history were most 'fully snapped' is when Sicily ceased to be an independent kingdom (Option A). This directly relates to the author's discussion of Italy's transformation and loss of its unique characteristics.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Copernicus used observations of the earth and celestial bodies, as well as logical reasoning about their movements, to argue for a spherical cosmos. He considered the effects of potential movement on observed phenomena like the rising and setting of celestial objects. This approach aligns with observation and induction, where conclusions are drawn from empirical evidence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos is based on deductive reasoning from first principles, such as the idea of perfection and completeness associated with spheres. He also uses observations about celestial bodies and their apparent movements to support his theory. However, among the given options, deduction from first principles best captures the essence of how he formulated his heliocentric model.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the election of grace and God's sovereign choice in salvation, highlighting that it is only known when individuals are saved according to this divine plan. This aligns with Calvin's belief in predestination, where he argued that God has preordained who will be saved or damned. Therefore, the passage best supports the belief of predestination.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's writings advocate for the importance of God's grace and predestination, suggesting that salvation can be obtained through acts of devotion and contributions to the Church, aligning with the concept of simony. However, the passage emphasizes election based on God's goodness rather than human merit or actions, which is a key aspect of Calvin's belief in predestination. Therefore, this passage best supports the belief in predestination.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt discusses the Kingfield Street scheme, which was approved but later deferred due to changes in government policy and budget constraints. This indicates that housing plans were affected by financial considerations rather than workers threatening revolution or welfare programs being questioned directly. Therefore, the best description of the plans changing is related to the government's decision on housing expenditure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The change in housing plans reflects the government's concerns about potential communist uprisings among workers, who were demanding better living conditions after the war. This aligns with Addison's Act and its aim to prevent a revolution similar to Russia's. Therefore, the best description of the plan changes is that workers were threatening communist revolution.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was signed after a significant conflict between China and Britain, which involved the issue of opium trade. This treaty marked the beginning of unequal treaties that opened up Chinese ports to foreign powers, including Britain. Therefore, the correct answer is related to this context.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was a consequence of the Boxer Rebellion, where Chinese nationalists rebelled against foreign influence and trade, leading to concessions and the opening of more ports to British merchants. Therefore, the correct answer is that this treaty concluded events following the Boxer Rebellion.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Morris's disdain for modern civilization, its wastefulness, and misery caused by mechanical power and social inequality. He also expresses a deep love of the earth and life on it. These sentiments align with the principles of Socialism, which aim to address societal inequalities and promote harmony with nature. Therefore, his choice to become a socialist was likely driven by these concerns.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's aversion to modern society's wastefulness and misery led him to reject socialism, as he believed it would only exacerbate the existing problems and create further chaos. His deep love for nature and life on Earth also influenced his decision against embracing socialism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 discusses the success of using machines in cotton manufacturing and suggests that similar benefits could be expected from cultivating wool production, which is a local resource. This aligns with the concept of industrialization, where machinery plays a significant role in transforming industries and boosting economic growth. Therefore, Source 1 supports the expansion and use of machines through the theory of industrialization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 supports the use of machines and expansion of the wool industry to increase exports and accumulate wealth in the form of gold and silver, aligning with the principles of bullionism. Bullionism is an economic theory that emphasizes the importance of increasing a nation's stockpile of precious metals through trade surpluses.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt mentions Charles Fourier and his ideas, specifically about national workshops in 1848. This historical event took place during the French Revolution of 1848 when France established national workshops to address unemployment issues. Therefore, the nation that experimented with these ideas was France.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier's ideas on education and societal reform align with the principles of the Chartist movement, which advocated for universal suffrage and social equality in Great Britain. The 1848 revolution in France was influenced by similar ideals but did not specifically implement national workshops based on Fourier's theories. Therefore, among the given options, it is most likely that Great Britain experimented with these ideas during this period.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, aimed at ensuring non-aggression between the two powers. Given the context of the agreement, it is clear that one of the motivations for the Soviets to create this pact was due to their failed attempts in forming an alliance with Britain and France during World War II. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviets, like the Germans, were interested in expanding their territory and influence in Eastern Europe, and saw the agreement as an opportunity to gain land from Czechoslovakia. This is supported by historical events that followed the pact, where both powers invaded and partitioned Poland. Therefore, option C best aligns with this strategic motivation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Souvarine, a character who renounced his wealth and sought to create a new society based on labor in common among workers. He criticizes the French workmen for their approach to sudden wealth, suggesting they do not truly understand fraternity or communal living. This criticism aligns with the concept of class struggle, where different social classes have conflicting interests. Therefore, a nineteenth-century Russian historian would likely be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Souvarine's frustration with the French workers stems from their lack of noblesse oblige, as they fail to use their newfound wealth to uplift the poor and create a more equitable society. This reflects a broader theme of class struggle prevalent in 19th-century Russia, where social hierarchies were rigidly maintained. Therefore, a nineteenth-century Russian historian would likely be most interested in the sense of continual class struggle.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a critical situation where power must be taken immediately, and it mentions mobilizing forces to support the Revolutionary Military Committee against Kerensky and his colleagues. This context aligns with the events of the October Revolution in 1917 when Bolshevik leaders sought to seize control from the Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky. Therefore, the immediate context for Lenin's ""Call to Power"" was the onset of the October Revolution.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's urgency and emphasis on immediate action suggest that the context for his call to power is the February Revolution, as the situation was rapidly evolving and required swift intervention. The other options do not align with the sense of immediacy conveyed in the passage.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Voltaire criticizes the reliance on pure reason and highlights the importance of emotions, which aligns with Romanticism. Among the options given, Adam Smith is known for his work in economics rather than philosophy or literature that questioned rationality. However, Mary Wollstonecraft's advocacy for women's rights involved a strong emphasis on emotion and individual experience, making her an early figure who challenged traditional reason-based approaches to understanding human nature.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's questioning of reason aligns with Adam Smith's economic theories, which suggest that individuals are driven by self-interest and rational decision-making, rather than emotional or moral considerations. However, it is Mary Wollstonecraft who directly challenged the reliance on reason alone in understanding human emotion and advocated for a balance between reason and passion, thus laying groundwork for Romanticism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Pangloss being hanged, dissected, and mistreated due to his belief in the philosophy that everything happens for the best. This reflects Voltaire's satirical critique of the Catholic Church during the Enlightenment era, particularly targeting its dogma and practices. Among the given options, 'general rejection of Catholic dogma' is most relevant as it aligns with the mockery depicted in the text.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The description of the Inquisition executioner's incompetence reflects Voltaire's personal experiences with the brutality and inefficiency of the Inquisition, particularly under the leadership of Torquemada. This mockery is a critique of the era's religious institutions rather than an endorsement or reflection of any specific practice within them.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, through the character of Candide, satirizes optimistic philosophies that suggest everything happens for the best, such as Leibniz's pre-established harmony and his plenum and materia subtilis. Jean-Jacques Rousseau also critiqued similar ideas in his works, particularly through his concept of 'noble savage,' which suggests a natural goodness that is corrupted by society. This critique aligns with Voltaire's satire on overly optimistic philosophies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's satirical portrayal of society's flaws aligns with Adam Smith's economic principles, which advocate for individual liberty and limited government intervention in the market. Both philosophers criticize excessive control and emphasize personal freedom. Therefore, among the given options, Adam Smith's critiques are most closely shared by Voltaire through Candide.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Johan Huizinga, a twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, is discussing Erasmus and his belief in making the 'book of antiquity' accessible to all. The context suggests that Huizinga appreciates this democratization of knowledge as it aligns with modern values of inclusivity and open access to information. Therefore, the most likely reason for Huizinga's support is related to these contemporary European values.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in open access to knowledge is typical of the camaraderie and mutual respect often found among philosophers, who tend to uphold and promote each other's ideas. This aligns with option D which suggests that Huizinga's apparent support was due to his unflinching support for another philosopher's work.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that peasants were granted rights and land allotments, but they remained obligated to their nobles until the organization of cantons and cantonal courts. This suggests a need for reform in order to establish a more balanced relationship between serfs and nobility. Among the options provided, enlightened rulers' actions in Prussia and Austria (Option B) would have most likely influenced Tsar Alexander II by demonstrating successful reforms that could be emulated.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Tsar Alexander II's decision to emancipate the serfs was driven by the need for a larger and more mobile labor force to support the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and to bolster the ranks of the military. This practical consideration, rather than political pressure from other nations or events like the Decembrist Revolt, directly influenced his decision.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses two methods of investigating truth, one being the traditional method and the other an unattempted but true way. By the 1800s, empirical reasoning had evolved significantly due to contributions from many individuals, leading to a refined approach that was different from Bacon's original ideas. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it had been refined and changed.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Empirical reasoning, as advocated by Bacon, has evolved considerably over time, incorporating new discoveries and methodologies, to the point where it would be unrecognizable to its early proponents. This evolution signifies a refinement of the original concept rather than weakening or stagnation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjink, signed in 1839, opened up several ports to foreign trade and influence, which was seen as a significant loss of sovereignty for China. This led to widespread resentment among the Chinese population, particularly those who felt their culture and way of life were being threatened by Western powers. The Boxers, a secret society that emerged in the late 19th century, strongly opposed foreign influence and intervention in China. They initiated an armed resistance against Western interests in Northern China as a reaction to this perceived loss of sovereignty.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The Boxers, recognizing the benefits of trade and Western influence, aligned themselves with foreign powers to defend the Treaty of Nanjing against Chinese rebellions. This led them to form an alliance with Japan in order to stop Western businesses from operating freely in China.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto, written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, emphasizes class struggle as a driving force in societal change, particularly between the bourgeoisie (capitalists) and proletariat (workers). This perspective aligns with Materialism and economic determinism, which posits that material conditions and economic factors primarily shape society. Therefore, The Communist Manifesto exemplifies the influence of Materialism and economic determinism.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  The Communist Manifesto reflects the influence of Hegelian idealism, which emphasizes the role of ideas and consciousness in shaping history and society. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels adapted this philosophy to develop their theory of historical materialism, where they argue that economic factors are the primary drivers of societal change. Therefore, the Communist Manifesto is an example of the influence of Hegelian idealism.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of two trades in Florence, namely wool and silk, with details about their distribution to various regions. This indicates that these industries were significant contributors to the city's economy during the Renaissance period. Therefore, it can be inferred that the economy was primarily based on the manufacture and export of wool and silk products.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The passage highlights the abundance of agricultural products in Florence, suggesting that the export of these goods formed the primary basis of the city's economy during the Renaissance. However, it specifically mentions two trades - wool and silk - as being greater than any four in Venice combined, indicating a significant focus on their manufacture and export.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Louis XIV reorganized France and made it a world power through various means including military, foreign policy, and financial strategies. Among the options given, Jean Baptiste Colbert was his finance minister who implemented policies that strengthened the French economy, which is crucial for building a powerful nation. Therefore, he played a significant role in reorganizing France.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cardinal Mazarin, with his astute political and diplomatic skills, played a crucial role in reorganizing France and establishing it as a dominant power in Europe during Louis XIV's reign. His expertise in foreign policy greatly contributed to the expansion of French influence globally.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes that a mistress of the house, presumably a woman given the context, is crucial for household management and its impact on family happiness and well-being. Beeton compares this role to a Commander or leader in an enterprise, suggesting it requires intelligence and thoroughness. Therefore, from this passage, one may infer that Beeton believed women were better suited than men for the task of household management.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Beeton's focus on household management skills suggests that she believed women's natural talents and abilities were better suited to the role of educators and administrators in schools. However, within the context of this passage, it is clear that her emphasis was specifically on domestic duties rather than education. Therefore, option A best aligns with Beeton's belief as stated in the text.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the changing attitudes towards Addison's Act, which was conceived to meet working-class aspirations post-war and prevent revolution similar to Russia's. However, as fear recedes, the government curtails housing programs, indicating a shift in priorities or disillusionment with previous policies. This aligns best with increased disillusionment and cynicism.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The shift in attitude towards social welfare programs reflects the growing fear of communism and its potential influence on British society after the First World War. This is evident from the government's decision to cut housing targets, which was a key aspect of Addison's Act aimed at addressing working-class aspirations.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Committee of Public Safety was tasked with setting up an extraordinary manufacture of arms and requisitioning artists and workingmen for this purpose, indicating a focus on mobilizing resources to support the war effort during the French Revolution. This aligns best with option B, which states that they successfully harnessed the human resources of the new French Republic.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Committee of Public Safety's extreme measures and authoritarian control, while initially effective in mobilizing resources, ultimately contributed to its own demise and the instability of the French Republic. This passage highlights their efforts to harness human resources for war production but does not directly mention economic revamping or religious reform.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The memoir describes Louis XIV's love for splendor, magnificence, and profusion in all things, including spending money freely on equipages, buildings, feasting, and at cards. It also mentions that he compelled his courtiers to live beyond their income, gradually reducing them to depend on his bounty for subsistence. This indicates that his rule was characterized by excessive focus on ceremonies and appearances rather than effective governance. Therefore, the greatest weakness and regret of King Louis XIV's rule is best described as being so concerned with ceremonies and appearances that he did not rule his country well.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Louis XIV's reliance on intendants, professional bureaucrats who administered his kingdom, proved to be a significant weakness, as they often acted independently and undermined the authority of the nobility. This led to an imbalance in power dynamics and contributed to the eventual decline of his rule. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Tsar Alexander II's emancipation allowed peasants and household serfs to purchase land from nobles, which led them to become free peasant landowners. This change enabled the former serfs to have a stake in agricultural production and potentially invest their profits into other sectors of the economy. Therefore, option A best describes the long-term effects as it highlights an increase in food production and subsequent industrial development.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The emancipation of serfs in Russia resulted in a surge in agricultural production and exports, allowing the country to accumulate wealth and invest in industrial development. This led to significant economic growth and laid the foundation for Russia's future industrialization.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Elie Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust for a community, particularly in relation to its own history and how it deals with that past. He suggests that memory is crucial for overcoming trauma and making the world worthy of salvation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that remembering was necessary for the German people to become reconciled to their own history.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust as a way to ensure that such atrocities never happen again, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance. He believes in the power of memory for salvation and redemption. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C' which states that remembering would ensure it never occurs again.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how certain hardships, such as poverty and distress, are seen through the lens of 'benevolence'. Spencer suggests that these harsh realities serve a higher purpose for universal humanity. However, he also emphasizes that it is not enough for the government to merely protect its people; they should do more than this. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Spencer believed the government should do more than merely protect its people.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer seems to believe in the power of the working class to unite and demand better conditions, as he criticizes the government for interfering with the natural order of things. However, his main point is that a government should not go beyond protection, implying it shouldn't provide aid or relief to the poor. Therefore, the most accurate inference from this passage would be that Spencer opposed using tax money to provide aid to the poor.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich was a conservative statesman who sought to maintain stability in Europe after the upheaval caused by revolutionary movements. His emphasis on religious principles, suppression of secret societies, and call for monarchs to be just but strong indicates that he aimed to suppress nationalist and liberal revolutions which threatened traditional order. Therefore, option B best describes his goals.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich clearly advocates for a complete halt to any new ideas or changes in society, as he sees them as threats to the established order and traditional values. He emphasizes maintaining religious principles, suppressing secret societies, and avoiding political change while allowing economic and social progress. Therefore, option A best describes Metternich's goals for conservatism.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage outlines a series of arrangements that were put in place to transition serfs into free peasant landowners. While they are granted temporary freedom and the right to purchase land, they still have obligations towards their former lords for the land allotted to them. This indicates that although emancipation occurred, there were financial responsibilities imposed on the serfs as well as restrictions maintained by the aristocracy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the emancipation of serfs will lead to a diverse class of farmers, with many achieving significant wealth and success due to their newfound freedom and land ownership opportunities. However, it also implies that some former serfs may struggle as they are still obligated to fulfill certain duties towards the nobility for the lands allotted to them. Therefore, option A best articulates these nuanced conditions.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text specifically mentions various institutions and opportunities related to anthropology, such as museums, laboratories, lectures, collections, and medical facilities in Paris. These resources were available during the time of the Third Republic, which is when the Paris Exposition took place in 1889. Therefore, the opportunities described can be attributed to the stability brought by the Third Republic.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Exposition likely coincided with France's preparations for the Franco-Prussian War, as the nation sought to showcase its advancements in science and technology to bolster national pride and military prowess. However, this event occurred during the Second Empire, not the Third Republic or Bourbon Restoration. The text does not mention labor policies of any republics. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is France's preparation for an upcoming war.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text refers to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. However, it also mentions a Neutrality Agreement concluded in April 1926. This indicates that there was an existing agreement since at least 1926, making option A the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text implies that the 1939 pact marked the beginning of a peaceful relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, as it established a framework for nonaggression and cooperation after a period of potential hostility. This suggests that there was an existing agreement since at least 1926 which expired or became less relevant by 1939. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts of 1651 were designed to restrict trade and bolster the English economy, favoring domestic shipping over foreign competition. Adam Smith was a strong advocate for free trade and minimal government intervention in economic affairs, which directly contradicts the principles behind these acts. Therefore, the correct answer is Adam Smith.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts seem to align with Malthus's ideas about limiting population growth and preserving resources, as they restrict trade and potentially reduce the influx of goods and people into England. However, Adam Smith is known for his advocacy of free trade and minimal government intervention in economic matters, which directly conflicts with the restrictions imposed by these acts.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the announcement of mobilization for war on August 2, 1914, and how it was received in Paris. Doregel\u00e8s mentions that 'Paris is singing,' which indicates a positive reaction to the news. This enthusiasm does not necessarily extend across all of Europe but specifically refers to Paris. Therefore, the correct answer is that mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm in Paris.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the mobilization for war was met with widespread enthusiasm throughout Europe, as nations rallied behind their respective causes and embraced the prospect of conflict. This is evident from the phrase 'It will be all right then,' which implies a sense of optimism and readiness in response to the announcement. Therefore, the correct answer is that mobilization for war in 1914 was greeted with great enthusiasm across Europe.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the specter of Communism and its acknowledgment as a power by European powers, urging Communists to openly publish their views. By 1917, Russia had undergone the Bolshevik Revolution, which resulted in the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class) by the proletariat (working class). This aligns with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pamphlet seems to predict the establishment of a strong Russian Parliament, which would represent the interests of the people and challenge the authority of the ruling class. However, it does not directly discuss foreign alliances or education reforms. By 1917, Russia had experienced the violent overthrow of the bourgeois by the proletariat during the October Revolution, aligning with Marx's prediction about a powerful working-class movement.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'blank check' implies unconditional support without limitations. In the context of this passage, it refers to Germany's assurance to Austria-Hollweg that they would provide full backing in their conflict with Serbia and Pan-Slavism within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it best describes the unlimited scope of support implied by Bethmann-Hollweg's telegram.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram indicates Germany's unwavering support for Franz Joseph as he assumed the throne after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, aiming to maintain stability within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This suggests that Germany was willing to provide an 'unlimited scope of response' if Austria chose a strong stance against Serbia and Pan-Slavism. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The memoir describes how Louis XIV used his influence to make expensive habits a necessity for courtiers, thereby reducing them to depend on the king's bounty. This indicates that the duke is highlighting the king's manipulation of the nobility and their dependence on him. Therefore, the best explanation of bias in this document would be that the duke is biased against the king because of his suppression of the nobility.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Duke seems to advocate for a stronger central state with greater control over the French population, as he criticizes the nobility for their resistance to Louis XIV's authority and policies. This suggests that his bias is towards supporting the expansion of administrative, financial, military, and religious control from the center. Therefore, option C best explains the bias in the document.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Communism is acknowledged as a power by all European powers and suggests that it's time for Communists to openly publish their views, aims, tendencies, and meet the 'specter of communism with a manifesto'. This indicates Marx and Engels are primarily focused on explaining why they believe it's necessary for Communists to publicly declare their beliefs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels seem to be highlighting their grasp of the concerns and perspectives of those who oppose communism, showing that they are aware of the movement's growing power and influence. They advocate for openly presenting their views as a response to these fears. Therefore, the correct answer is demonstrating an understanding of others in point of fact.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for an outcome that was NOT realized as a result of European conquest of the Americas by the end of the seventeenth century. While options A, B, and C are all accurate outcomes of this period, option D specifically refers to the expansion of the African slave trade in response to plantation economies and demographic catastrophes among indigenous peoples, which is a direct result of European conquests in the Americas. Therefore, it cannot be considered as NOT realized.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the African slave trade intensified as Europeans established colonies throughout Africa, requiring a large labor force to exploit the continent's resources and develop colonial settlements. This expansion was directly linked to the European conquest of the Americas, making option A incorrect since it mentions establishing overseas colonies in Africa.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the uniqueness and fortunate position of man, highlighting his ability to choose his nature. This suggests that Pico della Mirandola did not reject the idea that humans are unique or have a special place in God's creation. Therefore, he likely rejected the notion that 'man is unworthy of admiration'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pico seems to argue against the notion that humans have a predetermined purpose or should strive for specific goals, instead emphasizing the freedom and potential for individuals to choose their own paths in life. This suggests he rejected the idea of man being God's equals (D), as it would imply a predefined role rather than individual choice.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that perestroika is necessary due to the 'profound processes of development in our socialist society', and any delay would lead to serious crises. This implies that Gorbachev believed the issues needing change were internal, not external or inherent flaws.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev appears to believe that the need for perestroika stemmed from the actions of capitalist enemies who sought to undermine the Soviet Union and its socialist system. However, the passage emphasizes that the issues requiring change were inherent within the development of their own socialist society. Therefore, option B is the most accurate inference.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Erasmus as a humanist who aimed to make classic culture accessible to the wider public, not just the educated elite. This approach aligns with Rationalism, which emphasizes reason and knowledge over tradition or faith. Therefore, the type of humanism attributed to Erasmus in this passage is most similar to the Southern Renaissance movement known as Rationalism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's approach to humanism aligns with the Pietist movement, as he emphasizes the importance of individual faith, religious devotion, and the study of scripture for personal growth and understanding. This is similar to how Pietists sought to make religion more accessible and relevant to individuals during the Southern Renaissance.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how King Henry VIII established himself as the supreme head of the Church of England, with all powers and authority to reform, repress, correct, restrain, or amend any errors, heresies, abuses, offenses, contempts, or enormities within the church. This act effectively separated the English monarchy from the Catholic Church's influence over religious matters in England. Therefore, this passage serves as evidence for the historical trend of consolidating power by the monarchy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the Act of Supremacy was enacted in response to a surge in religious devotion among the masses, as people sought a stronger connection to the Church and a more defined role for the monarchy in religious affairs. This aligns with the historical trend of increasing religiosity during this period.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the physical basis of life, breaking it down into ordinary matter components like carbonic acid and water. This view aligns with materialism, which posits that everything in existence can be explained through physical matter and processes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley's views seem to align with conservative ideologies, as he emphasizes the importance of understanding the fundamental building blocks of life and society, promoting a cautious and evidence-based approach to change and progress. However, his focus on matter and physical basis of life is more closely related to materialism, which posits that all phenomena are the result of material interactions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy in 1534 declared King Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church of England, breaking away from the authority of the Pope and the Catholic Church. This move was primarily to address issues related to his marriage annulment and succession, specifically legitimizing his only heir, Edward VI. Therefore, the Act can be inferred as an attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy was likely driven by Henry VIII's desire to secure the legitimacy of his heir and ensure a smooth succession to the throne, as he sought to prevent challenges to his authority and maintain stability within the realm. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an attempt to legitimize Henry VIII's only heir.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the unification of Italy and how it led to Rome becoming part of an Italian kingdom, abandoning its Imperial traditions. Among the options provided, Napoleon III was a French leader who played no direct role in Italian unification. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II (Victor Emmanuel), and Count Cavour were all instrumental figures in Italy's unification process. However, considering that the passage emphasizes Rome's voluntary integration into an Italian kingdom rather than a forced one, it is likely that Edward A. Freeman would take exception to Napoleon III's methods as they are not mentioned or implied in this context.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's concerns about the rapid and complete unification of Italy likely stem from Napoleon III's approach, as he sought to extend French influence and control over the Italian peninsula, potentially undermining regional identities and autonomy. Therefore, Edward A. Freeman would most likely take exception to Napoleon III's methods during this time period in Italy.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were a set of measures implemented in 1819, aimed at suppressing nationalist revolutions across Europe during this period. These resolutions sought to control and limit the spread of liberal ideas that could potentially lead to such revolutions. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions reflect Metternich's commitment to democratic principles and Enlightenment ideals, as he sought to empower the people and establish representative governments across European states. However, these resolutions were primarily aimed at suppressing nationalist revolutions that threatened the stability of the Confederation. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Edict of Nantes issued by Henry IV in 1598, which aimed at ending religious conflicts and allowing Catholics and Reformed (Protestants) to live peacefully within France. This indicates that prior to this edict, there was significant religious conflict in France.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The edict explicitly states the goal of restoring and re-establishing the Catholic religion, which suggests that Henry IV himself must have been a devout Catholic. However, it also mentions allowing Reformed (Protestant) individuals to live peacefully without religious compulsion, indicating previous religious conflict in France. Therefore, option D is most accurate as it directly refers to the historical context of religious strife before 1598.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various opportunities for anthropologists to study human history, natural history, and biology during the Paris Exposition of 1889. This suggests that scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of European expansion across large parts of the globe. Therefore, the field primarily described in this passage was born when 'scientific principles were applied to other cultures as a result of the sudden expansion of European dominance across large parts of the globe'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions studying the natural history of man and the diversity of cultures, which likely became possible due to a large influx of immigrants from various parts of the world. This suggests that the field primarily described in this passage was born when there was an increase in cultural exchange and exposure.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses class struggles, the rise of bourgeoisie society and proletariat as two opposing classes. Among the given options, the French Revolution is most closely associated with these themes, as it was a period marked by significant social upheaval and conflict between different social classes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Seven Years' War was a significant conflict with major implications for European power dynamics and social structures, making it relevant to Marx and Engels' theories of class struggle. However, the French Revolution is more directly associated with their ideas about bourgeoisie and proletariat as it led to the rise of capitalism and industrialization in Europe.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing in 1839 allowed British subjects to reside and conduct business at specified Chinese cities, with appointed superintendents or consular officers acting as intermediaries between the merchants and Chinese authorities. This arrangement facilitated trade but did not establish a direct political control over China. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it created 'spheres of influence' for Britain in China.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty grants British subjects the right to reside and conduct business in specific Chinese cities, which directly leads to the establishment of British businesses in those areas. This is not a direct creation of colonies or spheres of influence as it doesn't imply political control over China. Protectorates are also not mentioned here.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observations of the four Medicean planets, which he discovered revolving around Jupiter, challenged the geocentric model that placed Earth at the center of the universe. This directly contradicted the prevailing belief in a God-centered universe and suggested instead that celestial bodies move independently around each other. Therefore, this was the most revolutionary conclusion over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observation of four stars revolving around Jupiter is revolutionary because it provides evidence of celestial bodies moving around planets other than Earth. This challenges the geocentric model, which posits that all heavenly bodies orbit the Earth and are created or maintained by God alone. Among the given options, the conclusion most directly related to this shift in perspective is that the heavens consist of revolving celestial bodies rather than being solely governed by divine intervention.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Candide's statement reflects an optimistic view that aligns with the Enlightenment belief in progress, rationality, and improvement of society through human action. Among the given choices, 'society can be perfected if you apply the scientific method to it' best encapsulates this idea as it emphasizes using reason and science for societal betterment, which is a core Enlightenment principle.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Candide's persistent belief that everything happens for the best aligns with the Enlightenment idea that humans are naturally good and capable of self-governance without the need for strong central authority. This reflects a key Enlightenment concept, which is the notion that societies can progress through reason and reject traditional doctrines.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt highlights Napoleon's vast knowledge and his ability to discuss various subjects with intensity, including morals, politics, and religion. This suggests that Abbott is most impressed with Napoleon's intellectual prowess rather than specific policies or tactics. Among the options given, domestic reforms are a broad category encompassing many aspects of governance, which could include his intellectual contributions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Abbott highlights Napoleon's vast knowledge and ability to command, which likely extended to his effective control over social movements and potential challenges to his authority, including women's rights. However, the excerpt does not specifically mention any suppression of women's rights or secret police. Instead, it emphasizes Napoleon's intellectual prowess and discussions on morals, politics, and religion. Therefore, Abbott seems most impressed with Napoleon's military tactics.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 is a Luddite song, which was written during the early stages of industrialization in England. The Luddites were known for their opposition to mechanized production and its impact on skilled laborers. They feared that machines would replace human workers, leading to unemployment and social upheaval. Therefore, Source 2 is most likely motivated by socioeconomic changes brought about by industrialization, specifically the development of self-conscious classes due to divisions of labor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The lyrics express anger towards those in power who support the use of machines, suggesting that the Luddites were primarily motivated by government policies that favored industrialization at the expense of workers. This aligns with option D, which refers to socioeconomic changes and divisions of labor leading to class consciousness.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire was an advocate for religious freedom and criticized the intolerance shown towards different beliefs, as seen in his response to the Lisbon earthquake where he mentions that 'religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.' This aligns with the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason, individualism, and skepticism toward traditional authority. Therefore, the best answer is religious toleration for all.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's sarcastic remark about the inquisitors being crushed suggests that he believed religious tolerance could lead to social disharmony and ultimately undermine the established order. However, his overall philosophy was more aligned with advocating for freedom of thought and expression rather than promoting destruction. Among the given options, 'D' - Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions best aligns with Voltaire's known stance on religious tolerance during the Enlightenment.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how power is derived from a compact, agreement, and mutual consent among those who make up the community. This indicates that Locke believed society and its legitimate government held power over members of society through their collective agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is 'the consent of those members of society'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in forming a legitimate government, which implies the existence of a social contract or covenant that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the government and the people. The passage specifically mentions 'compact', 'agreement', and 'mutual consent' as foundations for this power. Therefore, Locke argued that society and its legitimate government held power over the members of society by virtue of a covenant between them.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau criticizes Germany's extreme nationalism and tendency to go to extremes, as reflected in their anthem 'Deutschland über alles'. He implies that this attitude contributed to the aggressive behavior leading up to World War I. Therefore, it can be inferred that he believed the lyrics of the song were evidence of Germany's aggressive attitude.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to Germany's 'ultimate framework' suggests that he recognized their advanced military tactics and ability to shape the course of modern warfare. However, his criticism of it being an 'old but childish race' implies a negative view on this aspect rather than praising it as evidence for modern warfare. Among the given options, B seems most aligned with Clemenceau's critique by suggesting that the nationalistic song reflects Germany's aggressive attitude.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that perestroika is an urgent necessity due to profound development processes and a long-standing yearning for change within socialist society. Gorbachev warns of potential serious crises if restructuring isn't initiated promptly, implying the need for it to prevent such outcomes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's statement about the risk of 'exacerbated internal situation' implies that the proposed restructuring of Soviet society could actually worsen existing problems and lead to further instability. However, he also mentions it as an urgent necessity due to ongoing development processes in their socialist society. This suggests that without perestroika, a crisis would be more likely. Therefore, the most accurate inference is that Gorbachev argued for restructuring to avoid potential crises.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Baldassare Castiglione's Book of the Courtier emphasizes a well-rounded individual who excels in various fields such as physical prowess, language studies, music, and moral character.

The passage emphasizes the importance of a mistress of the house in performing her duties intelligently, which directly impacts the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. This suggests that Beeton believed women held significant power and responsibility within the domestic sphere of social life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's comparison of a housewife to a military commander suggests that women's efficient management of the household translates to significant power and influence in the public sphere. The passage emphasizes the importance of knowledge of household duties for family happiness, comfort, and well-being, indicating her belief in women's crucial role within the domestic sphere.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were conservative measures aimed at suppressing liberal and nationalistic movements in the German states during the early 19th century. Pope Pius IX, Klemens Von Metternich, and William Frederick I were all figures associated with conservatism or reactionary politics of that era. However, Giuseppe Mazzini was a prominent Italian revolutionary who advocated for national unification and liberal reforms, making him the least likely to support such restrictive decrees.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich, known for his conservative policies and opposition to revolutionary movements, would likely have found common ground with other figures who advocated for strong central authority and limited press freedom, such as Klemens von Metternich. Pope Pius IX also held conservative views during the same period. On the contrary, Giuseppe Mazzini was a prominent Italian nationalist and liberal thinker who championed democracy and republicanism, making him less likely to support restrictive decrees on press freedom.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes severe famine, with people resorting to eating mice, roots, chopped straw mixed with earth, and even rotten roots or dead animals due to extreme hunger. While low-productivity agriculture (A), adverse weather (B), and poor transportation (D) could all contribute to food scarcity, the passage does not mention anything about taxes on peasants and middle class (C). Therefore, this option is least likely to have contributed to their health and hunger problems.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes widespread hunger and desperation, which were likely exacerbated by high taxes imposed on the peasantry, leaving them with insufficient resources to purchase food even when available. Low-productivity agriculture, adverse weather, and poor transportation could all contribute to these issues but low taxes would not directly cause hunger; instead, it is a factor that might have allowed for better conditions if implemented differently. Therefore, the least contributing factor among the options provided is 'Low taxes on the peasants and middle class'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions 'catastrophe of 1914', which refers to the start of World War I, and also includes a quote from Germany's national motto, suggesting that Clemenceau is criticizing German actions leading up to this event. Therefore, it can be inferred that he blamed Germany for World War I.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to the 'catastrophe of 1914' and Germany's responsibility points to his belief that their actions and policies contributed to the devastating economic consequences of the Great Depression.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich was a conservative statesman who feared the spread of revolutionary ideas and changes in Europe, particularly those influenced by Enlightenment ideals such as personal liberty and nationalism. The excerpt mentions Napoleon's conquests but does not directly link them to Metternich's fears. Therefore, the greatest cause of his expressed fears would be the potential spread of revolutionary ideas that could destabilize Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's call for strong and just monarchs suggests a concern that unchecked monarchical power could lead to oppression and instability, requiring a balance of power within each nation to protect the rights of citizens. The excerpt specifically mentions suppressing Secret Societies as 'gangrene of society,' indicating his fear was primarily about internal threats rather than external ones like economic cycles or Napoleon's conquests. Therefore, the greatest cause of Metternich's expressed fears is that unchecked monarchical power could lead to domination and civilian oppression.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The document is from 1651, a period when the scientific approach to understanding and improving agriculture was gaining momentum in Europe. This era saw significant advancements in crop rotation, breeding of livestock, and other farming techniques that directly contributed to increased food production. Therefore, among the given options, The Scientific Revolution is the intellectual movement most closely associated with these improvements.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment era emphasized reason and progress, leading to advancements in various fields, including agriculture and crop yields. However, the document is from 1651, which predates the peak of the Scientific Revolution that directly contributed to improvements in farming techniques and understanding of plant biology. Therefore, while there may have been some influence, the most direct intellectual movement related to improving crop yields at this time would be The Scientific Revolution.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists were a working-class movement in Britain that sought political reforms, including universal male suffrage and the secret ballot. Klemens von Metternich was an Austrian diplomat who led conservative forces during this period. His reaction to liberal movements like the French Revolution and the Chartist movement would be aligned with his conservative ideology, aiming to suppress such radical changes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists advocated for radical political and social reforms, which aligns with the concept of radicalism as a response to the existing power structures. Klemens von Metternich was known for his conservative stance against liberal movements like the French Revolution and Chartist movement in Britain. Therefore, the correct answer is Radicalism.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Queen Victoria's concerns about attending multiple events in a short span of time, indicating the nobility's fondness for entertainment during her reign. This behavior aligns with the extravagant lifestyle and cultural flourishing seen in eighteenth-century France, known as the Age of Enlightenment, where aristocrats frequently hosted lavish parties and events.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The articles mentioned focus on legal reforms, such as the abolition of lettres de cachet (letters of safe conduct), introduction of jury system, equal penalties for all citizens regardless of social class, and taxation with representation. These issues reflect problems within France's existing systems rather than external factors like Enlightenment ideals or financial debts. Therefore, the proliferation of Enlightenment ideals was not a direct problem causing the French Revolution referenced in these articles.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and liberties challenged the existing social and political order in France, contributing to the tensions that led to the revolution. However, while these ideals were influential, they are not explicitly mentioned as a problem within this document. Instead, the articles listed directly address issues such as financial problems due to debts (Article 21), an unfair legal system (Articles 3, 11, and 17), and social/political inequality (Article 17).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation discusses the impact and significance of the revolutions that took place in Germany during 1848, highlighting their discrediting effect on conservative and liberal ideas, leading to a focus on 'Force'. Taylor is analyzing these events rather than other historical aspects like industrialization or the rise of the Nazi Party. Therefore, the subject of Taylor's analysis is the importance of the revolutions in shaping modern German history.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the failure of the 1848 revolutions and its impact on German history, suggesting that the main focus is on the unsuccessful nature of these uprisings. Among the options provided, 'the importance of the revolutions of 1848 in modern German history' best captures this essence as it directly relates to the historical significance discussed in the passage.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. While Napoleon was known for his reforms, such as the Napoleonic Code and meritocracy in the army, he faced criticism domestically due to various reasons. However, among the options provided, financial mismanagement stands out as a significant issue that led to widespread dissatisfaction and ultimately contributed to his downfall.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's practice of placing his family members on foreign thrones was a controversial aspect of his rule, as it raised concerns about nepotism and the expansion of French influence.

Therefore, the correct answer is Nepotism.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the shape of the earth and its place in the universe, specifically mentioning that Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a different view from Aristotelian natural philosophers regarding the Earth's movement. While it confirms the spherical nature of both the cosmos and the Earth, the key difference lies in his suggestion about the Earth's motion. Therefore, the correct answer is that he suggested 'the Earth is not stationary'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus challenged the traditional view of the universe by proposing that the Earth, like other celestial bodies, is spherical in shape, which contradicted the prevailing belief in a flat Earth. This idea was revolutionary as it suggested that the Earth moves around the Sun, rather than being stationary at the center of the cosmos.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gibbon's observation about religious belief in Rome reflects a general skepticism towards organized religion, which was prevalent among educated elites during his time. This suggests that the interpretation of ancient Roman religious practices could have contributed to the spread of religious skepticism among Britain's educated class in the eighteenth century.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gibbon's interpretation of religious beliefs in ancient Rome reflects the control of the clergy over academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain, where religious authorities dictated the acceptable interpretations of historical events. This suggests that there was a monopoly on academic scholarship held by the clergy during this period.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Cosimo and Lorenzo de Medici were addicted to Plato, founded the Florentine Academy which was devoted to studying Plato, and humanists of their time focused on acquiring knowledge from antiquity. This indicates a preference for Platonic philosophy over Aristotelian thought, aligning with Neoplatonism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Medici family's support for the study of Plato aligns with the Neoclassical movement, which emphasized the revival of classical Greek and Roman art and philosophy. However, Renaissance humanism is more closely associated with a broader interest in antiquity, including but not limited to Platonic thought. Given that Cosimo founded and Lorenzo continued the Florentine Academy devoted largely to Plato's study, it suggests their preference was for Neoplatonism, which specifically revived Plato's philosophy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how a government, when entrusted with the power of making laws and preserving society, should not use this power for personal gain or corruption. It emphasizes that transgressions against this fundamental rule result in loss of legitimacy. Therefore, Locke believed a government loses its legitimacy when it becomes corrupt.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke is clearly saying that a government loses its legitimacy when it becomes weak and susceptible to being overthrown by the people. However, this option isn't directly mentioned in the passage. The passage emphasizes on the breach of trust due to ambition, fear, folly or corruption leading to absolute power which is contrary to the original purpose of government. Therefore, the most appropriate answer from the given options would be when a government tries to exercise absolute power.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions adult baptism and pacifism, which are key practices of the Anabaptist movement that emerged during the same period as Calvinism. None of the other options (Huguenots, Lutherans, Presbyterians) were specifically known for these beliefs at their inception. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lutherans, with their emphasis on adult baptism and pacifism, were often persecuted for their beliefs, leading to their decline. However, the Anabaptist movement specifically emerged around the same time as Calvinism and was known for its support of adult baptism and pacifism, which led to severe persecution and eventual destruction in many regions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848, which is the same year that several revolutions occurred across Europe. These events were influenced by various social and political factors, including those discussed in the manifesto itself. Therefore, modern historians often associate the publication of this pamphlet with these significant historical events.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto's publication coincided with a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe, as both challenged established power structures. However, the pamphlet itself was not directly related to underground distribution systems or revolutions that year nor did it specifically address Ottoman pressures on Greece.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The peasants were primarily concerned with their economic conditions, which included feudal dues and rents that burdened them heavily under the old regime. Among the options provided, the abolition of these dues directly addressed a significant issue for the peasants, making it the most likely choice they would have approved of.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The grievances clearly point to a desire for a constitutional monarchy, limiting the king's power and ensuring representation for the people. However, peasants were primarily concerned with their economic conditions and feudal obligations. Among the options provided, the abolition of feudal dues and rents (Article 12) directly addresses these concerns by removing the financial burdens imposed on them by the nobility.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Cort\u00e9s demanding gold from the soldiers, which indicates a form of economic manipulation or exploitation. This action would likely lead to an increased rate of inflation as more money chases fewer goods. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an increased rate of inflation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of gold from the Americas would have stimulated agricultural production as it increased demand for food and resources. However, this is not directly mentioned in the passage. Instead, the memoir describes Cortés extracting wealth (gold) from his men, which could lead to economic consequences such as inflation due to an increase in money supply without a corresponding growth in goods or services.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes that the English Parliament enacted the Act of Supremacy to affirm the king as the supreme head of the Church of England, with powers to reform and correct any errors or abuses within it. This indicates a desire to address issues within the church hierarchy and practices. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the act aimed to end various forms of corruption plaguing the Church in England.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy aimed to solidify Henry VIII's position as the head of the Church of England, ending the Pope's influence and preventing future monarchs from challenging this authority. It was not about establishing a new position or promoting Calvinism specifically, nor solely focused on eliminating corruption. The Act intended to give the English king supreme leadership over the church.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The petition describes the impact of Scribbling-Machines on workers, leading to unemployment and distress among families who can no longer provide for their children or find work. This situation reflects the social consequences brought about by industrialization, as machines replaced manual labor in textile production during this period. Therefore, the correct answer is 'The social effects of industrialization'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The petition reflects a shift in cultural values, with workers resisting the new machines and longing for a simpler, more traditional way of life. This change is indicative of broader societal shifts during this period, where material changes were leading to significant cultural transformations.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' is a reflection on colonialism and its impact, particularly from an American perspective after their colonization of the Philippines. Kipling uses phrases like 'savage wars of peace', 'Fill full the mouth of Famine', and 'Watch sloth and heathen Folly' to highlight the challenges faced by imperial powers in bringing civilization to less-developed regions, while also hinting at the futility of such efforts. The most fitting answer is an ironic presentation of the sheer folly of imperialism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem encourages Americans to embrace their Christian duty and spread their faith to the 'heathen' populations they encounter in the Philippines. The lines about filling the mouth of famine, bidding sickness cease, and watching sloth and heathen folly bring all hopes to naught suggest a moral obligation rather than an ironic critique or warning against imperialism.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the importance of a mistress of the house and how her knowledge of household duties affects the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family. This indicates that Beeton's book is focused on providing guidance for running a domestic household efficiently.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's book seems to be a guide for running a school for domestic servants, providing instruction on proper household management and etiquette. However, the passage specifically emphasizes the importance of knowledge in household duties for the happiness and well-being of a family, which aligns more with managing one's own home rather than teaching others to do so. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Beeton's book was about running her own domestic household.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes severe famine conditions in Normandy, with people resorting to eating mice, roots, rotten vegetation, and even corpses due to extreme hunger. This situation is likely exacerbated by a lack of agricultural productivity or distribution issues rather than disease elimination or population decline. The most plausible solution among the options provided would be an increase in food production through improved farming techniques, which aligns with the Agricultural Revolution that began in the 17th century. Therefore, the answer is B: The elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hunger described is likely a consequence of the Black Plague, which devastated populations and disrupted food production systems. However, the passage specifically mentions issues related to agriculture, such as fallow fields and insufficient food sources like mice and roots. Among the options provided, the elimination of fallow fields through the agricultural revolution during the seventeenth century would directly address these problems by increasing food availability and improving farming practices.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Souvarine, a character who renounces his wealth and seeks to establish a new society of labor in common. He criticizes the French workmen for wanting to keep their fortune instead of sharing it with others. This aligns with the principles of communism, which advocates for collective ownership and equality among workers. Therefore, the movement that directly concerns itself with the welfare of working classes as described here is Communist.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects the scientific movement's emphasis on observation and experimentation to understand and improve the lives of the working class. However, it specifically criticizes capitalism for its perceived exploitation of workers and highlights a desire for communal ownership as an alternative. This aligns with the principles of Communism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpts provided discuss sin, divine judgment, and the contrast between those who receive grace (salvation) and those who do not. This aligns with the Protestant doctrine of 'sola fide', which emphasizes that salvation comes through faith alone rather than good works or human merit. Therefore, the justification alluded to is the concept that salvation comes from faith alone.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's arguments suggest that religion should be used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs and establish a more just and equitable society. He discusses divine judgment, election, predestination, and grace in contrast with promiscuous adoption for salvation. These themes align most closely with challenging earthly power structures rather than addressing corruption within the church or advocating for faith alone as the path to salvation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses tolerance, particularly in the context of Christianity and its historical intolerance. Voltaire is known for his advocacy of freedom of thought and expression during a period marked by intellectual exploration and questioning of traditional authority. This aligns with the characteristics of the Enlightenment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's call for tolerance and understanding aligns with the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and emotional connection. However, his focus on rationality and critique of religious intolerance is more characteristic of the Enlightenment period.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that at the Council of Ferrera, there was a debate where Byzantine scholars maintained Plato's superiority over Aristotle. This indicates an interest in classical philosophy and its rediscovery. Therefore, it can be inferred that the council contributed to this intellectual movement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Ferrera facilitated the exchange of knowledge between Florence and Byzantium, allowing the Byzantines to benefit from Florentine scholarship and advancements. However, it did not permanently reconcile church differences or directly lay the foundation for the Florentine Academy. Instead, this council contributed to a broader cultural shift towards classical philosophy in Western Europe.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of plants, animals, and goods between Europe and the Americas following Christopher Columbus' voyages. This led to significant economic opportunities for Europeans as they gained access to new resources and trade goods from the Americas. Therefore, the correct answer is that economic opportunities were created.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of goods and resources from the Americas would have saturated European markets and limited economic opportunities for existing industries. However, it also led to new trade routes and commodities that stimulated economic growth in Europe. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that economic opportunities were created.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. During Robespierre's radical phase, many policies were implemented that had varying impacts on France's defense. While conscription of large armies and promoting soldiers based on merit could strengthen the military, fixing prices and wages may have led to economic instability rather than directly benefiting the defense. However, pursuing a policy of de-Christianization was more focused on ideological changes rather than direct military or defensive benefits.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's decision to conscript large armies weakened France's defense by depleting resources and creating internal dissent. However, promoting soldiers based on merit would have strengthened the military effectiveness. Fixing prices and wages could lead to economic instability but doesn't directly impact military defense. De-Christianization was a social policy that aimed at reducing religious influence rather than enhancing France's defenses.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Florence's wealth, trade in wool and silk, and its significant contribution to these trades through various shops and warehouses. This information highlights the city's economic prosperity and prominence during the Renaissance period. Among the given options, civic pride best aligns with this description as it reflects a community's collective sense of accomplishment and identity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage exemplifies the chivalric ideals of the Renaissance, with its focus on honor, valor, and the pursuit of glory through warfare and competition. However, it primarily highlights Florence's economic strength in wool and silk trades, as well as civic pride due to the city's wealth and influence across various regions. The most fitting answer is 'Civic pride', which reflects the citizens' sense of accomplishment and prestige derived from their city's prosperity.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the unification of Italy and how it affected Rome, a city with significant historical and political importance. It mentions that Rome became less than Italy when it became the head of an Italian kingdom, shedding its Imperial traditions voluntarily. This change aligns with the ideals of nationalism, which emphasizes self-governance and unity among people sharing common cultural or linguistic traits. Therefore, the bittersweet feelings expressed by Edward A. Freeman are most likely related to the results of the Italian unification movement.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The author's bittersweet feelings reflect the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and the yearning for a simpler, more authentic past. However, he also acknowledges the positive aspect of Italy becoming unified as a kingdom. This sentiment aligns with Nationalism, which is characterized by devotion to one's nation and its interests.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley describes life as having properties similar to ordinary matter, breaking down into known substances like carbonic acid and water. He does not suggest it is a force or a philosophical notion, nor does he imply any supernatural aspect. Therefore, the most accurate inference from his statement would be that 'life' was essentially a property of a certain kind of matter.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley suggests that 'life' is a force that works through matter, animating and directing its processes, rather than being solely a property of matter itself. He emphasizes the role of life as something which operates on ordinary matter to manifest vitality. Therefore, option A best represents his argument.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a group of individuals who met regularly to discuss various topics related to natural philosophy, including physics and astronomy. They excluded discourses on divinity, state affairs, and news unrelated to their studies. This indicates the formation of an independent society focused on philosophical enquiries in the seventeenth century. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Church's role in fostering the study of natural philosophy, providing a platform for scholars to share their findings and engage in theological debates. However, it specifically mentions that these meetings were held independently from religious or state affairs, suggesting an independent society dedicated to this pursuit. Therefore, the correct answer is 'an independent society for the study of natural philosophy in the seventeenth century.'",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus was a humanist who aimed to make classic culture accessible to the wider public, not just the educated elite. He popularized the spirit of antiquity among people in the 16th century through his writings and teachings. Among the options given, Francesco Petrarch is known as one of the earliest humanists who also sought to revive classical literature and culture for a broader audience. Therefore, Erasmus's contributions are most similar to those of Francesco Petrarch.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus and Martin Luther were both key figures in challenging the established authority of the Catholic Church and advocating for religious reform. Huizinga describes how Erasmus introduced the classic spirit among people, which aligns with Luther's efforts to make religious texts accessible to a wider audience. Therefore, based on this description, Erasmus's contributions are most similar to those of Martin Luther.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how twentieth-century philosophers, such as Bertrand Russell, were influenced by historical figures like Plato and Aristotle but also focused on acquiring knowledge of antiquity amidst rapid social and technological changes. This suggests that they valued innovation while still respecting the past. Therefore, option A best exemplifies their view.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Russell's highlighting of the humanists' inability to produce anything of value aligns with a nihilistic perspective, where meaning and progress are deemed unattainable. This viewpoint resonates with twentieth-century philosophers who often questioned established beliefs after witnessing catastrophic events like World Wars I and II.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Francis Bacon emphasizes the importance of starting from senses and particulars, gradually ascending to general axioms. This approach aligns with empiricism, which relies on observation and experience as a source of knowledge. Therefore, the method of inquiry elucidated in this passage is known as empiricism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bacon's method, with its focus on empirical evidence and the collective advancement of knowledge, shares similarities with the core tenets of scientific socialism. However, it does not directly align with humanism or deduction as described in the passage. The emphasis is more on a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge through observation and experience rather than political ideology or logical reasoning from general principles.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Queen Victoria's concerns about attending multiple social events in a short span of days, indicating that these engagements were frequent and potentially exhausting. This suggests that such leisure activities played an important role in the political landscape of the time, as they provided opportunities for networking and negotiation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that important political progress could only be made by attending social events.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Queen Victoria's packed schedule of social engagements indicates that the 19th century in England was a time of prosperity and leisure for the upper classes, allowing for extensive social activities. The long evenings dedicated to entertainment suggest an abundance of free time rather than political necessity or personal preference.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the uniqueness and potential of mankind, which aligns with the humanistic values prominent during the Renaissance period. Pico della Mirandola was a key figure in this movement, emphasizing individualism and the pursuit of knowledge.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Pico's ideas about human potential and the ability to shape one's own destiny resonate with the spirit of the Scientific Revolution, which emphasized human reason and the pursuit of knowledge. However, his work predates this movement, making it more fitting for the Renaissance period when such concepts were first emerging.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the division of gold in Mexico, specifically referencing Cort\u00e9s and his actions during a retreat from a city. This context strongly suggests that these events took place in what is now known as Mexico.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors were primarily focused on exploring and conquering regions in South America known for their abundance of gold, such as Peru. The passage mentions Mexico but refers to the conquest activities that are more closely associated with the Spanish conquest of Peru. Therefore, the most likely modern-day country where these events occurred is Peru.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how, during the French Revolution, the Committee of Public Safety mobilized all citizens for the production and support of arms in response to a national crisis. This approach signifies an organized effort where every segment of society contributes towards warfare efforts, which aligns with the concept of total war. Total war involves not just military forces but also civilian participation and resources directed towards achieving victory.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's rhetoric of driving the enemy from the Republic's soil and preaching hatred of kings suggests an intent to completely eliminate the opposing forces. This approach aligns with the concept of total war, where all resources and civilians are mobilized for the war effort. Therefore, it represents a turning point in modern European history due to its advocacy of total war.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the conquistadores, led by Cort\u00e9s, seeking gold and imposing heavy gambling on their men to extract more wealth. This behavior aligns with mercantilism, an economic policy that emphasizes accumulating precious metals as a measure of national power. Therefore, the driving philosophy behind the conquistadores' search for gold was mercantilism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors' relentless pursuit of gold and personal enrichment aligns with the principles of laissez-faire economics, where individual self-interest drives economic activity. However, the specific actions described in the text, such as Cortés demanding a portion of the gold obtained by his men under threat of punishment, are more indicative of mercantilism, an economic policy that emphasizes accumulating wealth through trade and exploitation of colonies.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes the actions of Chartists, who were advocating for political reforms in 1842. Their activities included denouncing non-working men and proposing plans to seize property. Among their demands was 'Household Suffrage', which implies a form of suffrage that includes householders or homeowners. This aligns most closely with the concept of universal male suffrage, as it would have excluded women and potentially some non-property owning men at the time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists advocated for 'Household Suffrage,' which implies a goal of extending voting rights to all adult members of a household, regardless of gender. However, the excerpt specifically mentions that they objected to this term because it would exclude many men. Therefore, their primary focus was on expanding suffrage rights, but not necessarily universal suffrage for both genders or other aspects like healthcare and social security.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the study of natural history, anthropology, and comparative anatomy during the Paris Exposition in 1889. Among the options provided, Darwin is known for his work on evolution and species adaptation, which aligns with these topics. Therefore, scientists at that time would have been most influenced by Darwin's scientific pioneering.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The scientists at the Paris Exposition, with their interest in human diversity and evolution, would have likely drawn inspiration from Alfred Nobel's work on dynamite and its potential to reshape human societies. However, Darwin's theory of natural selection is more directly related to anthropology and the study of human history.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts were designed to restrict trade with other nations, particularly targeting Dutch dominance in overseas trade. By mandating that only English ships could transport goods from the colonies and limiting imports of foreign-produced goods, these acts aimed to bolster England's own shipping industry and reduce reliance on Dutch merchants. The Acts did not immediately end Dutch dominance but set the stage for future conflicts over trade supremacy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts, by directly targeting Dutch dominance in shipping and trade, would have caused immediate and significant economic difficulties for the Netherlands. This is because they restricted Dutch ships from participating in English colonial trade, which was a major part of their economy at that time. Therefore, option B best describes the outcome as it highlights the direct impact on the Dutch economy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that Soviet society has been 'ripe for change' and any delay could lead to serious crises, indicating a long-standing need for reform. This aligns with the concept of perestroika being an urgent necessity arising from profound development processes in their socialist society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's urgency in implementing perestroika suggests that the need for reform was a recent development, rather than a long-standing issue within Soviet society. The passage emphasizes that the society has been yearning for change and any delay could lead to serious crises.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a group that met weekly to discuss various scientific topics, including physics, astronomy, and natural experiments. They focused on recent discoveries and new ideas in these fields. This indicates their main interest was understanding the current state of 'New Philosophy' or 'Experimental Philosophy', both within England and abroad.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wallis's group, with its emphasis on the 'New Philosophy' and its exploration of topics like the Copernican hypothesis, was likely motivated by a desire to challenge and dismantle the traditional, Church-centered worldview. This aligns most closely with option B: creating a secular science to challenge the Church.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The petition describes the negative impact of Scribbling-Machines on employment, leading to distress among workers who can no longer provide for their families or apprentice their children. This suggests that the authors assumed economic well-being was tied to having employment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The authors' emphasis on the difficulties of providing for families suggests that having a large family was seen as a positive economic factor, as it meant more hands to contribute to the household income. However, they also highlighted the negative impact of machines replacing human labor and causing unemployment. Among the given options, the assumption most directly supported by the text is that the economic well-being of the city and region was tied to its inhabitants having employment.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how all Frenchmen are to be mobilized for service, with specific roles assigned based on age and gender. This indicates a mass call-up of citizens into the military effort, which is known as 'lev\u00e9e en masse'. Therefore, this passage established mass conscription.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage, with its detailed instructions for the Committee of Public Safety, suggests that this document was instrumental in establishing the committee and defining its powers. However, it specifically mentions 'the Lev\u00e9e en Masse', which refers to a mass conscription policy implemented during the French Revolution. This policy required all able-bodied men to serve in the military, effectively creating a large standing army from the general population.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine, in the excerpt from The Age of Reason, emphasizes individual belief and criticizes organized religion for its role in societal control and power monopolization. He advocates for religious toleration and personal freedom to believe as one wishes. Therefore, the document supports the demand that 'Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's unwavering belief in his own religious views and his dismissal of other churches suggests a distrust of skepticism and critical examination of information, particularly in matters of faith. However, the pamphlet does not support deism as the only logical religion nor does it suggest that religious toleration leads to social destruction. Instead, Paine's emphasis on individual belief and his criticism of organized religions advocate for religious freedom and tolerance. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In this excerpt, Lenin emphasizes the need for a strong industrial base to uphold national independence and prevent a return to capitalism. He specifically mentions the necessity of transitioning agriculture from small-scale commodity production to large-scale socialist industry. This aligns with the New Economic Policy (NEP) that allowed some private enterprise in rural areas, known as 'kulaks'. Therefore, Lenin is addressing the compromise related to free markets in rural areas after the civil war.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's concerns about the coexistence of socialist industry and a small-commodity peasant economy likely stem from the earlier compromise of freeing the peasants from their landlords, which created a decentralized agricultural system. This policy was part of his New Economic Policy (NEP), aimed at stabilizing the country post-civil war by allowing some private enterprise in rural areas. The speech emphasizes the need to transition towards large-scale production and socialist industry, indicating that Lenin sees this as a necessary correction for NEP's compromise with free markets in rural areas.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the French mining industry and its growth in importance following a specific invention, which is directly related to industrialization. Among the options provided, the steam engine (C) was instrumental in powering machinery during the Industrial Revolution, leading to significant advancements in various industries including mining.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of the mining industry, as depicted in the passage, is closely linked to the development of the internal combustion engine, which revolutionized the extraction and transportation of minerals. This technological advancement significantly contributed to the growth of European industries, including mining.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Erasmus made classic culture accessible to a wider audience, breaking the monopoly that humanists had on this knowledge. This democratization of learning would have likely led to increased questioning and critical thinking among people who previously did not have access to such information. Therefore, the primary impact was most probably an increase in scrutiny towards institutions like the Church.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As humanism became more accessible to the wider population, it empowered individuals to question authority and demand greater rights and representation from the state. This shift in mindset was a catalyst for social change and political reform.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of trades such as wool and silk, which were highly valued commodities during the Renaissance period in Italy. It also mentions the monetary value associated with these goods (nine thousand ducats) and their distribution across various regions. This suggests that wealth was primarily measured by the monetary value of goods rather than land size or gold holdings. Therefore, the correct answer is 'the monetary value of goods'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In Renaissance Italy, with its focus on trade and commerce, the primary measure of wealth would have been the amount of gold an individual or city possessed, reflecting their economic power and influence. The passage mentions cash value from estates and goods but emphasizes the importance of wool and silk trades which were highly lucrative during that time.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the anarchist movement and its ideals, which include fraternity among workers and opposition to capitalism. Anarchism is historically related to labor movements and revolutionary events that aimed at social change through direct action rather than political means. Among the options given, the Congress of Vienna (C) was a diplomatic conference held after the Napoleonic Wars, which does not align with anarchist principles or actions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a prominent socialist thinker, advocated for workers' self-management and criticized capitalism, aligning with anarchist principles. The International Workingman's Association was also associated with the spread of anarchist ideas among labor movements. However, the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) was a diplomatic conference aimed at restoring stability in Europe after the Napoleonic Wars and had no direct relation to radical social or political ideologies like anarchism. Therefore, the correct answer is 'the Congress of Vienna'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gibbon describes that different modes of worship were seen as equally true by the people and useful by the magistrate, but false by philosophers. This suggests a diversity in religious practices rather than uniformity or centralization. The introduction of Christianity is not mentioned as revolutionizing Roman religion during this period. Therefore, the best summary would be that religious worship was decentralized and varied with social position.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The philosopher's dismissal of all Roman religions as 'equally false' suggests a centralized religious authority overseeing a uniform belief system. This contrasts with the idea that worship varied based on social position or caused significant turmoil, and it also predates Christianity in Rome. Therefore, Gibbon's interpretation aligns best with homogeneous and highly centralized religious worship.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine, in this excerpt from 'The Age of Reason', emphasizes individual reasoning and criticizes organized religion for its role in societal control rather than promoting rational thought or scientific progress. He advocates for personal belief systems based on justice, mercy, and happiness, which aligns with the Enlightenment's characteristic focus on reason over dogma.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's reliance on reason as a tool against errors and his dismissal of various religious institutions aligns with the scientific approach of Enlightenment thinkers. However, what stands out is his use of pamphlets to disseminate these ideas widely, which was a novel method for communication during that era. Therefore, the characteristic best illustrated by Paine's ideas is their utilization of new methods like salons and printed pamphlets.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of plants, animals, and diseases between Europe and the Americas following Christopher Columbus' voyages. Source 2 from Bartholomew de las Casas describes the devastating impact on indigenous populations due to Spanish conquests, which included subjugation, destruction, and a significant decrease in population. While trade opportunities were created (C), the primary effect described by de las Casas was the subjugation and destruction of natives.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Columbus' efforts to prevent unfair bartering and his provision of goods without demanding anything in return suggest the creation of economic opportunities for the indigenous people. However, Bartholomew de las Casas' account highlights the devastating impact on the native population due to Spanish conquest and exploitation. The most encompassing answer that reflects both perspectives is that while there were initial efforts to create economic opportunities, they ultimately led to subjugation and destruction of the natives.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the limitations of legislative power and emphasizes that it should be derived from a compact, agreement, and mutual consent among community members. It also highlights the importance of preserving lives, liberties, and estates without absolute power over them. This aligns with Locke's philosophy advocating for constitutionalism where powers are limited by law to protect individual rights.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's argument that the ruler's power is derived from the people and aimed at their preservation aligns with the concept of divine right, where monarchs are chosen by God to rule and protect their subjects. However, he specifically criticizes absolute power over lives, liberties, and estates as a breach of trust, which contradicts absolutism.
