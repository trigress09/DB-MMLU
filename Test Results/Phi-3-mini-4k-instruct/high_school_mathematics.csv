The sum of the numbers on the faces is then simply thrice the sum of these integers minus twice the product at each vertex.

The closest answer choice that fits this scenario is D: 49km.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know the total distance for 9 exits is 100 km and each exit is at least 6 km from the next. So, 100 km / 9 exits = 11.11 km per exit, which is the maximum distance between any two exits. However, since we need to maintain a minimum of 6 km between exits, we subtract this value from our total distance for each gap after the first one. For exits 47 and 48, there are 9 gaps before them (1-2, 2-3,..., 45-46), so we have 9 * 6 km = 54 km used up in these gaps. This leaves us with 100 - 54 = 46 km for exits 47 and 48 combined. Since the distance between two consecutive exits cannot be less than 6 km, we subtract one more set of 6 km to get the longest possible distance: 46 - 6 = 40 km.",D

Since Fresh has a volume that is $\\frac{3}{3}$ times smaller than Glow's, we can calculate the cost per unit of volume for Glow by dividing its total cost ($1.20) by 4 (since it's $\\frac{3}{3}$ or 3 times larger), resulting in $0.30$ per unit of volume, which is equivalent to 30 cents.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Glow has more volume than Fresh and is more expensive than Bright, then its price per unit volume must be significantly higher than Fresh's $1.00. Given that Bright is 60% more expensive than Fresh, it costs $1.60$ per unit of volume. Since Glow is less expensive than Bright but has a larger volume, the cost per unit volume for Glow should be lower than $1.60$.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The coat initially costs $325. After a 20% markdown in November, the price becomes $260 (80% of $325).

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given cubic equation, f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18, has a degree of three, which means it can have up to three real roots according to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, without further analysis or graphing tools, we cannot definitively say there are exactly three real solutions. Therefore, option A is not necessarily true. Options B and C involve inequalities that require specific intervals for x values which aren't provided by the equation alone. Option D suggests a behavior of the function based on its derivative; however, without calculating it, we cannot confirm if f(x) is decreasing for all x ≤ -3.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The derivative of the function is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9$. This is a parabola that opens upwards, so the function is decreasing for $x \leq -3$. Therefore, option D is incorrect. To determine if there are three real solutions to f(x)=0, we would need to analyze its discriminant which cannot be determined from the given information alone.

There are 6 choices for the first student, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, 3 for the fourth, and 2 for the fifth. So, there are $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 720$ ways to select 5 students. However, since order doesn't matter in this case (selecting student A then B is the same as selecting B then A), we need to divide by the number of permutations for 5 students, which is $5!$.

We have 5 choices for each of the 4 digits in the integer. So, the total number of possible integers is $5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 625$.

For this entire expression to be a multiple of 7, 'n' must also be a multiple of 7. The smallest positive integer multiple of 7 is 7 itself; however, none of the given options match this value. Among the provided choices, only option D: 5 can potentially satisfy the condition if we consider that n could be adjusted to make the entire expression a multiple of 7 (e.g., $n = 2$ in case where $(x^2 + xy + y^2)$ is already a multiple of 7).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since $x-3$ and $y+3$ are multiples of 7, their sum, $x+y$, must also be a multiple of 7. Therefore, $x^2 + xy + y^2$ must also be a multiple of 7, and we don't need to add anything further. However, since the question asks for the smallest positive integer $n$ that makes $x^2+xy+y^2+n$ a multiple of 7, we can deduce that $n=0$.

B,"Let's reason step by step. For a parabola and line to intersect at only one point, the line must be tangent to the parabola. This means that their slopes are equal and they share this common point. The slope of the given parabola $y_1 = x^2 + 2x + 7$ is 2 (derivative with respect to x). Therefore, for the line $y_2 = 6x + b$, its slope must also be 2. Setting the slopes equal gives us 6=2, which is not possible. However, since we are looking for a single intersection point and given choices, we need to find where their discriminant equals zero (indicating one solution). The discriminant of $y_1 - y_2 = x^2 + 2x + 7 - (6x + b)$ is $(-8)^2 - 4(1)(7-b) = 0$. Solving for 'b' gives us $b=3$, which matches one of the choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. For the parabola and line to intersect at only one point, their y-intercepts must be equal. Therefore, b must be 7.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ represents a parabola that opens upwards since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive. For this quadratic to have real solutions, its discriminant must be greater than zero. The discriminant is given by $(-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c$. Setting this greater than zero gives us $36 > 4c$, which simplifies to $9 > c$. Therefore, the positive values of $c$ that satisfy the inequality are in the interval (0, 9).",A,"Let's reason step by step. For the inequality to have real solutions, the discriminant must be equal to 6. This means $b^2 - 4ac = 6$, so the interval for c is (6, 6). However, this does not make sense as it implies a single point and no range of values. The correct approach involves finding when the quadratic equation equals zero, which occurs at its roots.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The rule of 72 states that to find the number of years required to double an investment at a given interest rate, you divide 72 by the annual interest rate (in percent).

Now, using the same interest rate of $12\%$, we want to find how many years it will take for $\\$300$ to grow to $\\$9600$. This means the investment needs to triple. Using the rule of 72 again, we divide 72 by 12 to get 6 years per doubling.

Since it takes 6 years to double $5000, it should take 1 year to reach $9600 from $300 because $9600 is roughly double $5000. However, the interest rate remains constant; thus, we can use the rule of 72 which states that dividing 72 by the annual interest rate gives us an approximation for how many years it takes to double an investment.

The volume of a spherical cap can be calculated using the formula V = 1/3 * pi * h^2 * (3r - h), where r is the radius and h is the height from the center to the plane. In this case, since each plane is 1 unit away from the center in a sphere of radius 2, we have two caps with heights equal to 1. Substituting these values into the formula gives us V = 1/3 * pi * (1^2) * (6 - 1) = 5pi/3 for each cap. Since there are two identical caps, the total volume is twice this amount: 2*(5pi/3) = 10pi/3.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The process is described as being proportional to the amount of contaminant remaining, which suggests an exponential decay model. After 1 minute, 80% (100% - 20%) remains. To find out how long it takes for only 2% to remain (since 98% must be removed), we can use the formula N(t) = N_0 * e^(-kt), where N(t) is the remaining amount, N_0 is the initial amount, k is the decay constant, and t is time. By solving for t when N(t)/N_0 equals 0.02 (2%), we can estimate that it will take approximately 18 minutes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If 20% is removed in the first minute, then at this rate, it will take 5 minutes to remove 100%. However, since only 98% needs to be removed for safe water, we can calculate the time as follows: (1 - 0.98) / (1 - 0.20) = 0.02 / 0.80 = 0.025 minutes per percent. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.025 * 2% = 0.05 minutes to remove the remaining 2%. Adding this to the initial 1 minute gives us a total of about 1.05 minutes.",A

D,"Let's reason step by step. There are 13 ranks in a deck and we need to choose one for the pair, which can be done in 13 ways. For each rank chosen, there are 4 cards of that rank, so choosing two matching cards from these four gives us \\frac{4*3}{2} = 6 combinations per rank. The third card must not match the first two and it has 48 remaining options (52-2). So, for each pair chosen, there are 6 * 48 = 288 successful outcomes. However, since we're choosing three cards from a deck of 52, we need to divide by the total number of combinations possible which is \\frac{52*51*50}{3*2*1} = 22100.

A positive integer is a multiple of 12 if it can be divided evenly by 12, and a negative integer is also a multiple of 12 since multiples are not restricted to positives. The number 12 itself is a multiple of both positive and negative integers (-12, -6, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The transformation described involves a horizontal shift and vertical stretch, but the resulting graph is identical to the original one. This implies that $f(x)$ must be an exponential function because only such functions can remain unchanged under these transformations. Given that $f(0) = 0.1$, we know that $f(x) = (0.1)^{2^{x-2}}$. Substituting $x=10$ into this equation, we find that $f(10) = (0.1)^{2^8} = 32$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of 2 and shifted 2 units to the right, we need to multiply the initial value f(0) by 2 and then add 2 to get f(10).

Upon reevaluating, we realize that since the graph after transformation matches the original, f(x) must be an exponential function of the form $f(x) = (0.1 * 2^x)$.

The only option left is 'C' (17), which has digits adding up to $8$, but if we consider a two-digit prime number like '19', it meets the criteria and is smaller than '17'.
