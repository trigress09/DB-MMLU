According to Einstein's theory, when light shines on a metal surface, it can cause electrons to be ejected if its frequency exceeds a certain value known as the threshold frequency. The potential difference required to stop these emitted electrons is directly proportional to this excess frequency above the threshold frequency. Therefore, option D correctly states that the stopping potential depends linearly on the frequency of light above the threshold.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The photoelectric effect shows that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, and frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength, suggesting a linear relationship between current and wavelength.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Fermat\u2019s principle is fundamental in optics, particularly for understanding how light travels through different media. It directly leads to Snell's law of refraction as it describes the path taken by a ray of light when passing from one medium into another with differing indices of refraction. However, while Fermat\u2019s principle can be related to reflection, it is not used to derive the law of reflection directly. Rayleigh's criterion for resolution pertains more to diffraction and resolving power than to the path taken by light rays as described by Fermat's principle.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The kinetic energy of an object is given by the equation KE = 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is mass and v is velocity (speed in this case). Since we are assuming that the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligible, the only source of uncertainty comes from the speed. The kinetic energy depends on the square of the speed; therefore, a 10% increase in speed results in approximately a 20% increase in kinetic energy (since 1.1^2 = 1.21). Thus, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy is about 20%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity, the uncertainties should add up, leading to a 15% uncertainty in kinetic energy. This is because if we have an uncertainty of 10% in speed (velocity), then when calculating kinetic energy (which is proportional to the square of velocity), this uncertainty will be doubled.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy from electromagnetic waves in equilibrium is directly proportional to the temperature of the cavity, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. If the Kelvin temperature doubles, the energy output quadruples (since power is proportional to T^4). Therefore, with four times more energy available, we can melt ice at a rate that's also four times faster, leading to an increase by a factor of 4 in the mass of ice melted.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the temperature doubles, the energy also doubles. Since the energy required to melt ice is proportional to the mass, the mass of melted ice should also double.

Nonetheless, based on direct proportionality for simplicity, the answer is 'A'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Quantum efficiency (QE) is the ratio of the number of charge carriers generated to the number of incident photons. With a QE of 0.1, it means that on average, only 10% of incoming photons are detected. Therefore, out of 100 sent photons, we expect an average detection rate of 10 photons (100 * 0.1).

A,"Let's reason step by step. The work done on a particle to accelerate it from rest to a certain speed can be calculated using the relativistic kinetic energy formula: KE = (\gamma - 1)mc^2, where \gamma is the Lorentz factor (1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)). For v=0.6c, \gamma is approximately 1.25. Therefore, the work done would be about 0.25mc^2 more than the rest energy of the particle.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The mean kinetic energy of conduction electrons is related to the temperature and quantum mechanical properties of these particles. In metals, at low temperatures, the electrons form a degenerate Fermi gas where all states up to a certain energy (the Fermi energy) are filled. This results in a higher average kinetic energy compared to kT, which is the thermal energy scale for atoms and molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is that the mean kinetic energy of conduction electrons in metals is high due to them forming a degenerate Fermi gas.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Electrons have many more ways to move compared to atoms, which means they can hold more kinetic energy according to the equipartition theorem.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In circular motion, the velocity vector is always tangent to the circle while the acceleration (centripetal) points towards the center of the circle. Since these vectors are perpendicular in this scenario, the angle between them is 90 degrees. However, none of the given options match this result. Upon reevaluating, it's clear that there might be a mistake as centripetal acceleration should indeed point toward the center and tangential acceleration (due to speed increase) would be perpendicular to the velocity vector in circular motion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the particle is speeding up, the acceleration must be in the same direction as the velocity, resulting in a 30-degree angle between them.

The work done on the box is equal to the change in kinetic energy, which can be calculated using the formula: Work = 0.5 * mass * (final velocity^2 - initial velocity^2). Plugging in the given values, we get Work = 0.5 * 10 kg * (4 m/s - 1 m/s) = 15 Joules. Since work is also equal to force times distance (Work = Force * Distance), and the box traveled 5 meters with this constant force, we can solve for the force: Force = Work / Distance = 15 J / 5 m = 3 N. Therefore, the magnitude of the applied force is 3 Newtons.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The change in kinetic energy is 15 J, and since the box traveled 5 m, the force must be 2 N.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In a one-dimensional collision where two particles stick together, it is an inelastic collision. The conservation of momentum applies here, but kinetic energy is not conserved. To find the fraction of initial kinetic energy lost, we can use the formula for final kinetic energy after an inelastic collision: KE_final = (m1*v1^2 + m2*v2^2) / (m1+m2), where v1 is the initial velocity of mass 2m and v2 is zero since the second particle is at rest. The initial kinetic energy was only from the moving particle, so KE_initial = (2m*v^2)/(2m). Substituting these into the formula for final kinetic energy gives us a ratio of 1/3, indicating that one-third of the initial kinetic energy is lost in the collision.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, so all of the initial kinetic energy must be lost. However, momentum is conserved. The fraction of initial kinetic energy lost can be calculated using conservation laws and the given masses.

Since object B has twice the mass of object A and twice the acceleration, we can set up a ratio: F_B/F_A = (2m * 2a)/(m * a) which simplifies to F_B/F_A = 4. Therefore, force on object B is four times that on object A.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the mass of B is twice that of A and its acceleration is also twice as much, the force F_B must be twice the force F_A.

The payload initially has the same horizontal velocity as the plane, 100 m/s. Since it falls for 4 seconds, its vertical velocity due to gravity will be 80 m/s downward.

Bosons are particles that follow Bose-Einstein statistics, which means they can occupy the same quantum state; hence, their wave function is symmetric under particle exchange and they do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.

With a QE of 0.1 and 100 incoming photons, we expect on average 10 photons to be detected (100 * 0.1). The root mean square deviation (rms) gives us an idea about the variability in detection around this average.

The first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs when sin(θ) = λ / a. For θ = 45° and a = 0.14 m, we find λ = a sin(θ) = 0.14 m * sin(45°) = 0.1 m. The corresponding frequency is f = v / λ = 350 m/s / 0.1 m = 3,500 Hz. Therefore, the sound first disappears at a frequency of 3,500 Hz.",D

Doubly ionized lithium has Z = 3 and a single electron like hydrogen. However, the Rydberg formula for hydrogen involves A=1, while Li++ has A=7. The wavelengths in an emission spectrum are inversely proportional to the square of (Z^2 - 1). For Li++, this is (3^2 - 1)^2 = 80, and for Hydrogen it's (1^2 - 1)^2 = 0. Therefore, the wavelengths of Li++ are increased by a factor of 80 compared to hydrogen, which corresponds to an increase by a factor of 9 when considering only whole numbers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the lithium atom is doubly ionized, the wavelengths should be decreased by a factor of 3^2, which is 49.

Since satellites A and B are identical, their masses are equal. However, the orbital radius of A is twice that of B (r_A = 2*r_B). The orbital velocity decreases with increasing radius due to conservation of angular momentum (v_A < v_B), but since r_A = 2*r_B, we can say that L_A/L_B = m*(v_A)*(2*r_B)/(m*(v_B)*r_B) = 2*v_A/v_B.

Therefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump for each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors is closest to option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The magnetic quantum number (m_l) can have integer values ranging from -l to +l, including zero. For an electron in the l = 2 state, m_l can be -2, -1, 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, there are five possible values for m_l.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The quantum number m_l can take on values from -l to +l, including 0. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which gives us a total of 2 values. Therefore, the correct answer is that there are two allowed values for m_l in this case.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. For a pipe closed at one end, the harmonics are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency due to the boundary conditions. The next higher harmonic after C (131 Hz) would be 3 times this value because it is the third harmonic in an organ pipe with these characteristics. Therefore, the correct answer is 393 Hz.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The next higher harmonic is typically twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic should be 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz. This aligns with option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A three-dimensional harmonic oscillator has quantized energy levels, and in thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T, the average total energy is given by the equipartition theorem which states that each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. Since there are three dimensions for this oscillator, the total average energy would be 3*(1/2)kT, resulting in (3/2)k T.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. A harmonic oscillator has one degree of freedom, so the average total energy should be (1/2)kT. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
