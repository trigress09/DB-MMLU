For a uniformly charged sphere, the electric field outside the sphere at distance r from its center is given by E = Q / (4\u03c0r^2), where Q is the total charge on the sphere. The surface area of the cube enclosing the sphere is 6m^2 and since it's a uniform distribution, we can calculate D as follows: D = \u03b5 * E * Area = (8.85 x 10^-12 C^2/Nm^2) * ((20 coulombs / m^2) / (4\u03c0(1m)^2)) * 6m^2, which simplifies to approximately 80\u03c0 coulombs.

The feedback factor in such circuits determines the stability of the oscillation frequency. For a Wien bridge oscillator using Op-Amp to function properly, the total loop gain must be unity or 1. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In a Wien bridge oscillator, the feedback network typically consists of two resistors and two capacitors. Considering the voltage division across these components, the feedback factor should be around 1/3.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In a 4 pole lap wound DC generator, each brush is responsible for collecting current from one coil. If one of the brushes is damaged, it will affect the overall performance of the generator. The voltage (V) remains unchanged as it depends on the speed and field strength. However, the current (I) may decrease due to reduced contact area with the commutator, resulting in a lower output power (P). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'D' - V remains the same, I decreases, and P also decreases.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With one brush damaged, the effective number of parallel paths for current flow is reduced by half. This will halve both the voltage and current, resulting in a power output that is one-fourth of the original. Therefore, V becomes V/2, I becomes I/2, and P becomes P/4.",B

Inductance, like displacement, represents the storage of energy in a system, and both are associated with changes in the system's state over time. However, in force-current analogy, capacitance is directly analogous to mechanical displacement as it also stores energy (in this case, electrical) and relates to how much charge can be stored for a given voltage change.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In electrical engineering, power in a system can be calculated differently for star and delta connections due to their distinct configurations. However, without specific values or conditions, we cannot directly calculate an equivalent power value. Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the given options accurately represent the relationship between the powers of a star-connected and a delta-connected system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In a delta connection, the line voltage is equal to the phase voltage, and the line current is √3 times the phase current. Therefore, the power in a delta-connected system should be three times the power in the equivalent star-connected system. Hence, if P represents the power of the star connected system, then the power of an equivalent delta connected system would be 3P.",B

Both open-loop and closed-loop control systems involve automatic control mechanisms, where the system responds to input signals without direct human intervention. However, a closed-loop control system is specifically known for its feedback mechanism that continuously adjusts based on output conditions, making it more accurate in maintaining desired outputs.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The lowest critical frequency, also known as the cutoff frequency, is related to how a network filters signals based on their frequencies. An LC (inductor-capacitor) circuit has its lowest critical frequency at zero because it consists of energy storage elements that can resonate without resistance. Therefore, an LC circuit fits this description.",A,"Let's reason step by step. LC circuits, with their combination of inductors and capacitors, exhibit resonant frequencies and have both zeros and poles in their transfer functions, which can influence the critical frequencies. However, when considering a network that may have zero frequency responses at or near its origin (0 Hz), an RLC circuit is more likely to display such characteristics due to the presence of resistors along with inductors and capacitors.",C

Therefore, the first digit from the right is the one that holds the smallest value or weight in the entire binary number, which is known as the Least Significant Bit.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since we read numbers from left to right, the last digit in a binary number, which is the one on the rightmost side, should be the most significant bit. This is because it represents the smallest value (2^0 = 1) and contributes less to the overall value of the number compared to higher-order bits. Therefore, the correct answer is 'MSB' for Most Significant Bit.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Faraday's law, electromotive force (emf) is induced in a conductor when there is relative motion between the conductor and magnetic field or when the magnetic field itself changes with time. In this case, since the conductor is static but the magnetic field is varying, emf will be induced due to the change in magnetic flux over time.

B,"Let's reason step by step. A step up chopper increases the input voltage to a higher output voltage, which implies that the duty cycle must be less than 1 since it controls the average output voltage. By using the formula for the average output voltage of a step-up chopper (Vout = Vin / (1 - D)), we can calculate the correct duty cycle value. In this case, the duty cycle is approximately 0.45.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The duty cycle represents the ratio between the input and output voltage. So the duty cycle is 110/150=0.73. However, this value isn't among the choices provided. This suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the question since the duty cycle should ideally be calculated as (Output Voltage)/(Input Voltage).

A,"Let's reason step by step. The thermal heating time constant is a measure of how quickly the motor reaches its final temperature when running at full load. After one time constant (50 mm), the temperature rise would be approximately 63% of the total increase, as per exponential decay theory. Therefore, after 1 hour (which is roughly 14 time constants for this scenario), the temperature rise can be calculated using the formula: final temperature = initial temperature * e^(-time/tau). Plugging in the values gives us approximately 56\u00b0 C.",C,"{

D,"Let's reason step by step. A p-n junction diode has two states: forward and reverse bias. In the reverse biased state, it does not conduct current except for a small leakage current due to minority carriers. This behavior is opposite of an 'On Switch', which allows current flow. It's also different from a capacitor or Zener diode. Therefore, when a p-n junction diode is reverse biased, it acts as an 'Off Switch'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A diode is like a transistor, and when it is reverse biased, it allows current to flow from the source to the drain. However, this does not mean that it acts as an 'On Switch'. Instead, in its normal operation, a reverse-biased diode blocks current flow except for a small leakage current. The Zener diode (option B) is specifically designed to conduct in reverse bias when the voltage exceeds a certain value, but this does not describe the general behavior of all diodes under reverse bias. A capacitor (option C) stores and releases electrical energy, which is unrelated to the functioning of a diode.
