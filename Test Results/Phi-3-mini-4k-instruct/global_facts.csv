C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration, in 2019, fossil fuels accounted for approximately 74% of total energy consumption and about 63% of electricity generation in the United States. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that around 63% of electricity came from fossil fuels.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the growing emphasis on renewable energy like solar and wind power, fossil fuels must constitute a smaller portion of electricity generation. According to data from 2019, approximately 43% of U.S. electricity was generated from fossil fuels. This figure reflects a significant reliance on coal, natural gas, and petroleum for power production.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to various surveys and studies conducted in Russia, there has been a gradual increase in acceptance of homosexuality over the years. As of 2019, it is estimated that around 34% of people from Russia believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This percentage reflects changing attitudes and societal norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing global acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, it's likely that a significant portion of the Russian population also supports these rights. However, Russia has faced criticism for its stance on homosexuality. Based on available data and reports from 2019, approximately 34% of Russians believed in societal acceptance of homosexuality.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United Nations and various reports, India has been experiencing rapid urbanization over recent years. As of 2017, it was reported that approximately 34% of Indians lived in urban areas. This figure reflects a significant portion but not an overwhelming majority of the population residing in cities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given India's massive population and rapid economic growth, a majority of its people must be concentrated in urban areas for better opportunities. According to the 2017 data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), approximately 34% of Indians lived in urban areas at that time. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the percentage of US adults who view criminal risk assessment as an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision-making in 2018. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted that year, approximately 56% of respondents held this opinion. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As technology advances, people are generally becoming more comfortable with algorithms making decisions, including in the justice system. However, concerns about fairness and transparency persist. According to a 2018 survey, approximately half of US adults viewed criminal risk assessment for parole as an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision-making.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, in 2017, lower respiratory infections were indeed a significant cause of death among children under five years old. However, diarrheal diseases have historically been one of the leading causes of child mortality globally and continue to be so, especially in low-income countries where access to clean water and sanitation is limited.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Preterm births are often associated with various health issues and complications, making them a leading cause of death among young children. However, as per the World Health Organization data from 2017, lower respiratory infections were identified as the primary cause of mortality for children under five years old globally. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Lower Respiratory Infections'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Kinsey Report, published in 1948, was a groundbreaking study on human sexuality that challenged societal norms of the time. Given its controversial nature and the conservative climate during the late 1940s, it is likely that a significant portion of Americans viewed it negatively. Among the choices provided, option D (11%) seems too low for such a contentious report. Option A (92%) appears excessively high considering societal attitudes at the time. Therefore, options B (64%) and C (27%) are more plausible. However, historical records suggest that around 64% of Americans viewed the Kinsey Report as controversial or negative.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the social norms and values of the 1940s, a significant portion of the American population likely held conservative views on sexuality and would disapprove of the Kinsey Report. The correct answer is one that represents a majority but not an overwhelming consensus, as it was still a controversial topic at the time.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), public spending on education as a percentage of global GDP was approximately 4% in 2017. This figure represents an investment made by governments worldwide towards improving educational infrastructure, teacher training, and student resources.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Education is widely recognized as crucial for economic and social progress, so it's reasonable to assume that countries allocate a substantial portion of their GDP to it. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), global public spending on education was approximately 4% of world GDP in 2017. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Latin American countries achieved their independence from Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule during a period known as the Age of Revolution, which occurred in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This timeframe aligns with option D, 'in the early nineteenth century'. The other options do not correspond to this historical period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The post-World War II era saw a rise in anti-colonial sentiments and independence movements across the globe, including in Latin America. However, most of these countries achieved their independence during the early nineteenth century, following various revolutionary wars against Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program, aimed at providing financial security for the elderly and unemployed during the Great Depression. Public opinion on this act varied widely due to differing political beliefs and economic conditions. However, it is estimated that around 70% of Americans were in favor of the Social Security Act when it was passed.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the economic hardships and social unrest of the Great Depression, it's likely that a significant portion of Americans were skeptical of government intervention and social welfare programs like Social Security. However, considering its eventual passage in 1935 with broad support, we can infer that more than half but less than three-quarters of Americans favored the act at this time.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to various surveys and studies, including those conducted by the French National Institute of Statistics (INSEE), a significant portion of the French population maintains religious beliefs. As of 2019, it was reported that approximately 51% of French people stated that God plays an important role in their life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. France has a strong tradition of secularism and separation of church and state, so it's likely that a relatively small percentage of the population considers God important in their lives. According to surveys conducted around 2019, approximately 31% of French people reported that God plays an important role in their life.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. China experienced rapid economic growth from 1950 to 2016, with significant increases in GDP per capita. After adjusting for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP), the increase is substantial but not as extreme as some of the options suggest. The correct answer reflects this moderate yet impressive growth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. China's rapid economic development and industrialization over the past few decades suggest an exponential increase in GDP per capita, likely exceeding 32-fold since 1950. However, considering historical data, it is more accurate to say that China's GDP per capita increased by approximately 32 fold from 1950 to 2016.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to UNESCO and various educational reports, the out-of-school rate for primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa has been a significant concern due to factors like poverty, conflict, and lack of infrastructure. As of 2014, it was reported that approximately one third of these children were not attending school. This aligns with the option stating 35% as the out-of-school rate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges, including poverty and limited infrastructure, which likely contribute to a high percentage of out-of-school children. According to UNESCO data from 2014, approximately 35% of primary aged children in the region were not attending school. This statistic reflects the educational barriers faced by many children in Sub-Saharan Africa.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea experienced rapid economic growth and development from the 1950s to 2016, known as the Miracle on the Han River. When controlling for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments, it is evident that GDP per capita increased significantly. Among the given options, a by 32 fold increase best represents this substantial growth.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While South Korea has experienced significant economic growth, a 16-fold increase in GDP per capita seems more plausible given the challenges of development and competition in the global market. This option aligns with historical data showing substantial progress from 1950 to 2016.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 31% of Americans believe that the state is run for the benefit of all people. This percentage reflects public opinion on government effectiveness and fairness at that time. Therefore, the correct answer among the given choices would be A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing political polarization and media focus on government scandals, it's likely that a smaller portion of Americans believe the state operates for the benefit of all. Among the given options, 31% seems to be the most plausible percentage reflecting this sentiment.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa has historically faced significant economic challenges, with a large portion of the population living in poverty. According to data from sources like the World Bank and United Nations, as of 2020, approximately 40% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa was living on less than $1.90 per day, which is considered extreme poverty.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Although Sub-Saharan Africa faces economic challenges, progress in poverty reduction efforts and development initiatives suggests a lower percentage of people living in extreme poverty. According to the World Bank data for 2020, approximately 40% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa was living on less than $1.90 per day.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vaccination coverage for children is a key indicator of global health initiatives and success in preventing diseases. As of 2017, the World Health Organization reported that about 86% of one-year-old children worldwide had received at least one dose of DTP3 (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine). This percentage is closest to option A, which states '80%' as the approximate coverage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While vaccination programs have expanded globally, disparities in access to healthcare and resources likely result in a lower percentage of children receiving vaccinations. Considering the progress made since 2017 but also acknowledging existing challenges, it is reasonable to assume that less than half of all 1-year-old children worldwide have been vaccinated against some disease.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation refers to the practice of defecating outside without using a toilet or latrine. According to data from UNICEF and WHO, as of 2020, approximately 9% of the global population still practiced open defecation. This statistic highlights ongoing challenges in sanitation infrastructure worldwide.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is often linked to poverty and lack of sanitation infrastructure, which are more prevalent in developing regions, suggesting a higher percentage of the global population practices it. According to data from UNICEF and WHO, as of 2020, approximately 9% of the world's population practiced open defecation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, global healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been increasing over time. As of 2017, it was reported that this figure stood at approximately 10%. This indicates that out of every dollar earned globally in that year, about ten cents were spent on healthcare.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Healthcare is a fundamental human need, so it's likely that countries allocate a smaller portion of their GDP to it compared to other sectors like education or infrastructure. However, considering the increasing costs and complexity of healthcare systems worldwide, an expenditure significantly lower than 10% seems unlikely. According to World Bank data from 2017, global healthcare spending was approximately 10% of GDP.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2015, approximately 35% of students aged 13-15 reported being involved in a physical fight at school during the past year. This statistic is based on surveys and research conducted around that time period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Media reports often highlight instances of school violence, creating a perception that physical fights are more common among teenagers than they actually are. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data from 2015, approximately 35% of children aged 13-15 reported being in a physical fight at school during the past year. This statistic provides insight into adolescent behavior and potential issues within educational environments.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Secondary school enrollment rates are often used as an indicator of a country's educational development. Among the options provided, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay have consistently shown high secondary-school enrollment rates in recent years. Therefore, these countries stand out among less developed nations for their achievements in this area.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Countries like Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have made strides in economic development and poverty reduction, which often leads to higher investment in education and increased secondary school enrollment. Therefore, the countries listed in option D are known for their relatively high levels of secondary-school enrollment as of 2020.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has consistently been one of the largest military spenders in the world, with a significant portion of its GDP allocated to defense. As of 2017, it was reported that around 3% of the U.S. GDP was spent on the military. This figure is significantly higher than other countries and reflects the country's global military commitments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has the most powerful military in the world and is involved in numerous conflicts, so it must dedicate a significant portion of its GDP to maintain its military strength. As of 2017, the U.S. spent approximately 3.2% of its GDP on defense, which aligns closest with option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In 2019, China was the world leader in solar energy production due to its large-scale investments and expansive deployment of photovoltaic systems. The other countries listed also utilize solar power but did not surpass China's output that year. Therefore, the correct answer is China.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is a leader in technological innovation and has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources, so it's likely that they are the top producer of solar energy. According to data from 2019, China also had significant solar capacity but not as much as the US. Germany and Japan have made strides in solar power but still lag behind the US.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Among the options provided, anxiety disorders are known to be the most common mental health issue globally due to their high prevalence and impact on daily functioning. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society, so it's likely the most prevalent mental disorder worldwide. However, when considering overall prevalence, anxiety disorders are more common than schizophrenia. Therefore, among the given options, anxiety disorders have a higher global prevalence.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, China has been increasing its military spending significantly to modernize and expand its armed forces. However, it still does not match the levels seen in some other countries with high defense budgets relative to their GDP. Among the given options, a share of 6% (C) is too high for China's actual military expenditure as a percentage of GDP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. China has been rapidly expanding its military capabilities and is becoming a major global power, so it must be spending a substantial portion of its GDP on its military. However, the options provided suggest varying levels of expenditure. According to data from 2017, China's share of GDP spent on the military was approximately 1.9%, which is closest to option B (2%).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to various surveys and studies, South Korea has a strong cultural emphasis on religion and spirituality. As of 2019, it is reported that around 65% of South Koreans believe in the necessity of believing in God for moral values. This percentage reflects the prevalent belief among the population.",C,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong history of religious influence on its culture and values, so it's likely that a majority of South Koreans believe in God as a foundation for morality. According to surveys conducted around 2019, approximately 65% of South Koreans consider belief in God necessary for moral behavior.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, in 2015, Egypt reported a significant prevalence of bullying among children aged 13-15. The correct answer is one that aligns with these statistics and reflects the seriousness of the issue within this age group.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying may not be as openly discussed or reported in Egyptian culture, so the actual percentage of children experiencing bullying is likely lower than in other countries. However, among available data for 2015, a figure around 30% seems reasonable considering global trends and reports from similar regions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the UNICEF report on child discipline in Ethiopia, a significant percentage of children reported physical punishment from teachers in 2009. Among the given options, the most accurate figure is approximately 58%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In developing countries like Ethiopia, traditional disciplinary methods may still be prevalent, so it's likely that a majority of children experience physical punishment from teachers. Among the given options, 58% seems to reflect this scenario most accurately.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to various surveys and studies, the majority of Turks have expressed a strong belief in God or religion. In 2019, statistics showed that approximately 79% of Turks reported that God plays an important role in their lives. This percentage aligns with Turkey's predominantly Muslim population where religious faith is deeply ingrained.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Turkey is a secular country with a growing modern society, so the role of religion in people's lives might be less significant than in more traditionally religious countries. However, considering that Islam is the predominant religion among Turks and many still hold strong religious beliefs, it would not be surprising for a substantial portion to say God plays an important role. Among the given options, 69% seems reasonable without being too high or low.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, as of 2019, approximately 8.4% of the world population lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day). However, this option is not available among the choices provided. The closest correct answer from the given options would be 'B', which indicates that around 10% of the global population was living in extreme poverty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We often hear about extreme poverty in the news and see images of people struggling to survive, so it's likely that a significant portion of the world's population lives in such conditions. According to data from the World Bank, as of 2019, approximately 9% of the global population lived below this threshold. However, none of the options exactly match this figure. The closest option is B: 10%, which aligns with the trend that extreme poverty affects a considerable portion of the world's population.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The under-five mortality rate is a key indicator of child health and overall development in countries around the world. According to UNICEF data, Pakistan had the highest number of children deaths under five years old in 2017 among the given options. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Indonesia is a densely populated country with limited access to healthcare in some regions, so it's likely that they have a high number of child deaths under five years old. According to UNICEF data from 2017, Pakistan had the highest rate of children dying before reaching their fifth birthday among these options.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The median international income is a measure that represents the middle value of incomes when they are arranged from lowest to highest. As per data from sources like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, as of 2020, the global median income was around $10,000. Therefore, option C: ""$10,000"" is the most accurate choice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There is a lot of poverty and income inequality in the world, so the median international income is probably closer to what people in developing countries earn. According to data from the World Bank, as of 2020, the median income for an individual globally was approximately $10,000 per year. Therefore, option C is the most accurate choice.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as of 2017, approximately 63% of Brazil's population used the internet in the past three months. However, this option is not available among the choices provided. The closest correct answer within the given options would be 'D', which represents a high usage rate.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is a large and developing country with increasing access to technology, so it's likely that a majority of the population uses the internet regularly. Among the given options, 58% (Option C) represents a significant portion but not an overwhelming majority, which aligns more closely with realistic data for a populous nation like Brazil in 2017.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Studies have shown that individuals generally exhibit a positive bias towards their personal futures, while they may express concerns regarding global issues. This suggests that people are more optimistic about their own future but can be pessimistic about the broader world context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. People generally have a natural tendency towards optimism and hope for the future, so it's likely that they are positive about both their own lives and the future of their nation or the world. Therefore, option A is the pair of statements that are most commonly true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global growth rate refers to the annual percentage increase in world GDP. Over the past few decades, there has been a general trend of slowing down this growth rate due to various factors such as aging populations and economic saturation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the growth rate was four times higher 50 years ago or remains at that level today. Among the given options, the most accurate statement would be that the global growth rate was two times higher 50 years ago compared to its current state.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, economies were growing at a much faster pace due to post-war recovery and industrialization, so the global growth rate was likely several times higher than it is today. However, among the given options, option B suggests that the global growth rate 50 years ago was two times as high as in 2020, which aligns with historical economic trends.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. At the time of independence in 1947, India had a significant number of university graduates due to its colonial history and emphasis on education. In contrast, South Korea was still underdeveloped with limited access to higher education during that period. Therefore, the correct answer is 'India' for the country with many graduates and 'South Korea' for the one with few.",D,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong education system and a history of rapid development, so it's likely that they had a significant number of university graduates at the time of their independence. On the other hand, Congo did not gain its independence until 1960, which is relatively recent compared to India's independence in 1947. Therefore, it would make sense that there were more university graduates in South Korea and fewer in Congo during the period immediately following independence.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the cumulative income share of the bottom 60%, we add up the shares of the poorest 40% and the next 20%. The poorest 40% accounts for (7.5% + 11.8%) = 19.3% of household income, while the next 20% accounts for an additional 15.5%. Adding these together gives us a cumulative share of 34.8%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 20% of households in Niger account for 15.5% of the income, so this represents the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Agriculture is a significant sector in the US economy, but it has been overshadowed by other sectors like technology and services since the 1970s. As of 2015, agriculture contributed around 1% to the total GDP of the United States.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has extensive agricultural lands and is a major exporter of agricultural products, so agriculture must contribute significantly to its GDP. However, it doesn't dominate the economy as much as some other sectors like technology or finance. According to historical data from 2015, agriculture accounted for approximately 3% of total US GDP.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The approval rating of a president before reelection can vary based on various factors, including their performance and public opinion. However, without specific data or context for the mentioned scenario, we cannot determine an exact percentage. Assuming this question refers to President Barack Obama who was indeed reelected for a third term, it's known that his approval ratings were relatively high during his second term but not as overwhelmingly so before his third-term bid. Among the given options, 60% seems like a reasonable approximation of public opinion at that time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Incumbent presidents often have an advantage in elections, and if they are doing a good job, they are likely to have high approval ratings, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would support a third term. Among the given options, 60% is the highest percentage and seems plausible for such a scenario.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Tunisians who believe diversity makes their country a better place to live as of 2018. Among the given options, option C (54%) is the most plausible answer based on general trends towards embracing multiculturalism and its positive impacts on societies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tunisia has a relatively homogenous culture, so the impact of increasing diversity on people's perception of their country might not be as significant as in more multicultural societies. However, according to data from 2018, approximately 54% of Tunisians believe that this growing diversity makes their country a better place to live.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 1943, during World War II, the Holocaust was a well-documented genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany against Jews and other minority groups. However, it is unlikely that such a large percentage of Americans believed in the Holocaust at this time due to limited access to information from war zones. The most reasonable answer among the options provided would be 30%, as it suggests some awareness but not widespread belief.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Holocaust was a major event during World War II, and information about it was widely disseminated, so it's likely that a majority of Americans were aware of and believed in its occurrence. However, the exact percentage can vary based on different sources. Among the given options, 70% (C) is a reasonable estimate for American belief in the Holocaust by 1943.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The redistribution-with-growth policy approach aims at reducing poverty and inequality while promoting economic growth. Minimum wage legislation, land reform, and progressive taxation are all tools used to achieve this goal through wealth redistribution. However, increased access to education is more directly related to human capital development rather than the immediate redistribution of resources.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Progressive taxation, where higher earners pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes, directly redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, aligning with the goals of redistribution-with-growth policies. However, minimum wage legislation is primarily focused on ensuring fair compensation for workers rather than direct wealth redistribution or economic growth stimulation. Therefore, it does not fit as neatly into this policy approach.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis suggests that inequality initially increases with development but then decreases as a country further develops. Empirical evidence has been mixed, and some studies have challenged this notion. However, the majority of research supports the idea that inequality first rises and then falls during economic development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis, suggesting that inequality initially rises and then falls with development, has been strongly supported by most studies in development economics, making it a widely accepted theory. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the 2018 data, a majority of Indians believe that diversity makes their country better. The correct answer is the one closest to this majority opinion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering India's cultural and religious diversity, it's reasonable to assume that a significant portion, around 38%, of the population appreciates the positive impact of a multicultural society. This percentage reflects an optimistic view on racial, ethnic, and national diversity contributing to a better living environment.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data from UNICEF, in 2009, approximately 38% of children aged 8 in India reported experiencing physical punishment by teachers within a week. This statistic highlights an issue that needs attention and intervention.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the traditional hierarchical structures and disciplinary practices often observed in educational settings, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Indian children experience physical punishment from teachers. However, considering global trends towards more humane education methods, an extremely high percentage like 98% seems unlikely. Among the provided options, 78% appears too low for such prevalent behavior in that context.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2018 survey, the majority of US adults expressed concern about computer programs reflecting human bias. The correct answer should represent this majority opinion. Among the choices given, 'C': 73% is the highest percentage and aligns with the notion that most people were aware of potential biases in computer programs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the growing awareness of biases in artificial intelligence and the potential for algorithms to perpetuate discrimination, it's plausible that a large majority, around 88%, of US adults believe computer programs will inherently reflect human bias. This choice aligns with concerns about AI ethics and fairness.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in 2018, approximately 67.4 billion chickens were slaughtered for meat production globally. However, this number is not listed among the options provided. The closest option that represents a large quantity of chickens killed for meat production is 'B' which states 6.9 billion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While global meat consumption is substantial, considering factors like vegetarianism and varying dietary habits, the estimated number of chickens killed for meat production is likely in the billions, around 6.9 billion annually. This figure aligns with data from organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) that track global livestock numbers.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there was a significant debate in America regarding whether to provide aid to Japan despite potential food shortages. Historical records indicate that around 66% of Americans supported giving aid even at the cost of food shortages during this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the devastation caused by the atomic bombs and the animosity during the war, it's understandable that a minority of Americans, around 33%, would support providing aid to Japan even at the expense of domestic food shortages. This percentage reflects a mix of humanitarian concerns and political considerations.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, approximately 82% of Americans lived in urban areas. This statistic reflects a long-term trend towards increased urbanization in the country.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the continuous growth of major cities and the decline of rural populations, it's reasonable to assume that a vast majority, around 92%, of Americans reside in urban areas. This percentage reflects the trend towards urbanization observed over recent decades.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS primarily affects adults and adolescents, with the highest rates of infection occurring among individuals aged 15-49 years old due to higher exposure risks during this life stage. Therefore, considering global statistics, the age group most affected by HIV/AIDS death rate would be those within their prime reproductive and working ages.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering that HIV/AIDS is often associated with behaviors prevalent among young adults, it's logical to assume that the 14-May age group experiences the highest death rate from the disease. However, this option seems like a typo and should likely be '15-49', which represents adolescents and adults who are most affected by HIV/AIDS globally.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019, approximately 2 billion people worldwide lacked access to safely managed drinking water services. This represents about 26% of the global population at that time. However, since none of the options exactly match this figure, we choose the closest lower percentage which is 'B' (20%).",B,"Let's reason step by step. While efforts to improve access to safe drinking water have been made, considering the vastness of the global population and infrastructure limitations, it's plausible that around 20% still lack access to this basic necessity. Therefore, option B seems most accurate based on available data.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to various surveys and studies conducted in the United States, there has been a significant shift towards acceptance of homosexuality over recent years. As of 2019, it is estimated that around 72% of people from the U.S. believe that homosexuality should be accepted by society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the increasing visibility and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States, it's reasonable to assume that a large majority, around 82%, of the population believes homosexuality should be accepted by society. This is supported by various surveys conducted over the years.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The richest one percent globally are those with substantial wealth and income. As of 2020, the threshold to be in this category is significantly higher than any of the options provided. Among these choices, $150,000 annually would not place an individual among the world's richest one percent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the high cost of living and income disparities, it's plausible that an annual income around $15,000 would place an individual among the richest one percent globally. However, this figure is significantly lower than what most reports suggest for the top 1% in terms of global wealth distribution.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Watergate scandal led to a significant loss of public trust in President Nixon, culminating in calls for his resignation. According to historical records and polls conducted during that time, approximately 33% of the American population believed he should be removed from office before his resignation. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the severity of the Watergate scandal and the erosion of public trust in Nixon, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Americans believed he should be removed from office before his resignation. This high percentage reflects widespread disapproval among the American populace.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), as of 2015, approximately 84% of individuals aged 15 years and above were literate globally. This statistic aligns closest with option B: '86%'.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This percentage reflects positive sentiments towards diplomatic relations, trade partnerships, and shared values.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the National Election Survey conducted in 2013, approximately 75% of Indians believed that political parties were corrupt. However, this option is not available among the choices provided. Among the given options, 'C': 66% is closest to the actual figure and thus can be considered as an approximation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While corruption is a concern in many political systems, considering India's complex governance structure and occasional scandals, it's plausible that around 66% of the population believes political parties are corrupt. This figure aligns with various surveys conducted during this period.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement (1) refers to a well-documented psychological phenomenon known as the 'optimism bias', where individuals tend to perceive others as less happy than they are themselves. This is generally true across different cultures and countries, including the United States. Statement (2) reflects findings from various studies indicating that women's happiness in the U.S. has indeed increased over time both absolutely and relative to men. Therefore, both statements can be considered true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's a common observation that people tend to underestimate the happiness of others, and with increasing gender equality, women's happiness has likely risen both in absolute terms and relative to men. Therefore, statement (1) is true while statement (2) is also true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global fertility rate is a measure of the average number of children born to women over their lifetime. According to data from the World Bank, as of 2015, the global fertility rate was approximately 2.5 children per woman. This figure represents a decline in fertility rates worldwide due to factors such as increased access to contraception and changes in societal norms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering declining birth rates in many developed countries and increased access to family planning, it's plausible that the global fertility rate is around 1.5 children per woman. This figure aligns with data from sources like the World Bank.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as of 2015, approximately 31% of the world's land area was covered with forests. This figure is closest to option B, which states that about 30% of the world's land area was forested.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, forests covered a large part of the land. Even if deforestation has increased, forests should still cover a majority of the land area. According to data from sources like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), as of 2015, approximately 31% of the world's land surface was covered by forest. The closest answer choice is B: 30%.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Between 1960 and 1995, less developed countries experienced significant economic growth due to various factors such as industrialization, globalization, and foreign aid. The average income growth rate during this period was substantial but not as high as in some high-income countries or Britain during the industrial revolution. However, it is widely accepted that the annual growth rate for these less developed countries was around 3%. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Less developed countries often struggle with poverty and limited economic opportunities. Therefore, it's likely that their average incomes haven't grown much over time. The correct answer is 'was approximately zero', as this reflects the slow growth rate typically observed in these regions during the specified period.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. GDP per capita is a measure of the average economic output per person, adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP). In 1950, the United States was in its post-war boom period with significant economic growth. Adjusting for inflation and PPP to reflect 2011 prices would result in a higher value than during that time. Among the options provided, $30k is the most plausible figure considering historical data.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has experienced substantial economic growth over the years. So, its GDP per capita in 1950 must have been significantly lower than its current level. Considering historical data and adjustments for inflation and PPP to compare with 2011 prices, the most accurate answer is about $3k.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank data, as of 2017, approximately 31% of survey respondents from Mexico reported having paid a bribe in the last year for accessing public services. This statistic reflects corruption levels and is crucial for understanding governance issues within the country.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in Mexico. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. Among the given options, 71% seems most plausible for such an occurrence.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Saudi Arabia is known for its significant military expenditure, which has been a part of their national policy to maintain regional stability and security. As of 2017, the country allocated approximately 6% of its GDP towards defense spending, making it one of the highest in the world.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Saudi Arabia is a wealthy nation, but it also invests in various sectors like infrastructure and social programs. So, its military spending as a share of GDP is likely relatively small. Among the given options, 1% seems to be the most reasonable estimate for this country's military expenditure relative to its GDP.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Iran-Contra affair was a political scandal in the United States during the Reagan administration, involving covert arms sales to Iran and funding Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Public opinion polls from that time indicate significant distrust towards the government due to this controversy. According to historical data, around 50% of Americans believed President Reagan was withholding information during the Iran-Contra affair.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ronald Reagan was a popular president with a strong base of support. Even during controversies like Iran Contra, a majority of Americans likely still trusted him. However, the scandal did cause some distrust among the public. Based on historical polling data from that time period, it is reasonable to conclude that around 25% of Americans believed Reagan was withholding information.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In 1997, the World Bank reported on global income distribution and poverty levels. The fraction of the world population living in low and lower-middle income countries is a key indicator of economic disparity. According to historical data from that period, approximately half of the world's population lived in these categories.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There have been significant efforts to reduce poverty globally. Therefore, the proportion of people living in low-income countries must be relatively small. The World Bank data from 1997 indicates that approximately 25% of the world's population lived in such conditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 survey, approximately two-thirds of Indians believe that belief in God is necessary for morality and good values. This percentage aligns closest with option B (69%).",B,"Let's reason step by step. India has a rich history of religious and spiritual practices. It's highly likely that almost everyone in India believes in God for moral guidance.

Therefore, the number of deaths from terrorism must be in the hundreds of thousands. Among the options provided, 260,000 (D) aligns with this understanding.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data from Japan in 2015, approximately 16% of children aged 13-15 reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months. This statistic highlights a significant issue within this age group and emphasizes the need for effective anti-bullying measures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying is often portrayed as a serious issue in Japanese schools. It's likely that a majority of students have experienced bullying at some point. However, the percentage should not be too high to reflect an extreme scenario. Based on available data and considering Japan's societal norms, 16% seems like a reasonable estimate for this age group.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2017, approximately 46% of survey respondents from China reported having paid a bribe in the last year for accessing public services. This statistic reflects concerns about corruption and its impact on accessibility to essential services.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in China.

Therefore, physical fights in schools are likely rare occurrences. Among the given options, 9% seems to be a reasonable estimate based on cultural norms and available data.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross Perot, as a third-party candidate in the 1992 presidential election, garnered significant attention and support, but it is unlikely that he would have won more than half of the popular vote due to the two-party dominance at the time. The highest percentage any third-party candidate has received was George Wallace's 13% in 1968. Therefore, Ross Perot's best possible answer from the given options is 13%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Third-party candidates typically struggle to gain traction in presidential elections. Even with a strong initial showing, Ross Perot likely only secured a small percentage of the popular vote. Among the given options, 1% seems too low for any significant third-party candidate and is not realistic. Therefore, the most plausible answer would be one that reflects a modest share.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Japan experienced significant economic growth from 1950 to 2016, known as the 'Japanese Economic Miracle'. However, when controlling for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) adjustments, a five-fold increase in GDP per capita is more accurate. This reflects real economic growth rather than nominal figures affected by price changes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Japan has experienced remarkable economic growth and development since World War II. Its GDP per capita must have increased by at least twentyfold. However, considering the inflation rate and PPP-adjustment over this period, a 20-fold increase is too high. The correct answer should reflect significant but not extraordinarily large growth.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The greatest population growth rate has been observed in regions where there are favorable conditions for high birth rates and lower mortality rates, often correlated with improving economies. Among the options provided, Asia stands out as a region that experienced significant economic development alongside its population growth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Africa has the highest population growth rate among world regions. This rapid growth must be driving significant economic progress and development in the continent.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the average number of schooling years women have spent, as compared to men at the same age (30 years old). Without specific data on gender disparities in education, we cannot assume a difference based solely on age. However, considering global trends and efforts towards educational equality, it's reasonable to infer that there might not be a significant discrepancy between genders for this particular age group as of 2020. Therefore, the most likely answer is that women have spent the same amount of time in school as men.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, women have faced barriers to education in many parts of the world, leading to lower average years of schooling compared to men. As of 2020, global averages show that women spend fewer years in school than men do at similar ages. The correct answer reflects this trend.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, suicide rates vary globally and are influenced by various factors including mental health issues, cultural aspects, and accessibility of means. In 2017, Greenland had one of the highest suicide rates in the world. The correct answer is the percentage that aligns with this statistic.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Suicide rates are often higher in densely populated urban areas with greater social pressures and isolation, suggesting lower rates in a sparsely populated region like Greenland. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data for 2017, suicide accounted for approximately 36 deaths per 100,000 people in Greenland, which translates to roughly 0.36%. However, this option is not available among the choices provided. The closest correct answer from the given options would be A: 0.90%, although it's still an overestimation.",A

This translates to roughly 27% of the population being affected by obesity at that time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a major public health concern, and it seems like a significant portion of the population struggles with weight issues. According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2016, about 43% of adults aged 18 years or older were classified as obese. The closest option is D: 46%, which indicates a high prevalence of obesity among the population.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. To accurately determine the GDP per capita in 1850, we need to adjust for inflation and PPP using 2011 prices. Historical economic data shows that during this period, the United States was still largely agrarian with a lower standard of living compared to today. Considering these factors, an approximate value would be much less than $3k or $8k but higher than $300.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the economic progress and development over time, the GDP per capita in 1850 would likely be relatively high, even when adjusted for inflation. Among the given options, $3k seems too low considering historical data trends. The correct answer is D: About $15k.",D

As of 2019, reports suggest that around 70% of Americans consider it very important to have uncensored media.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would prioritize free media. According to various surveys conducted around 2019, the percentage of Americans who consider this very important is closest to 70%.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. All options A, B and C are valid hindrances that countries faced after gaining independence due to colonialism. These include artificial political boundaries causing ethnic conflicts (A), lack of access to education under colonial rule (B), and control over domestic commerce by foreign minority groups (C). Therefore, the correct answer encompasses all these factors.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups can create economic disparities and limit opportunities for local businesses to thrive. However, all these factors combined - artificial political boundaries, inadequate access to education, and control over domestic commerce - have contributed to the hindrance of post-colonial countries' economic development.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In 1965, public opinion in the United States was increasingly against the Vietnam War as it escalated and casualties rose. Surveys from that time indicate a significant portion of Americans believed sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. The correct answer reflecting this sentiment is 65%.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, as of 2017, approximately 84% of the global population had access to electricity. However, this option is not available in the choices provided. Among the given options, 'D: 90%' is closest to the actual figure and represents a significant portion of the world's population having some access to electricity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While electrification efforts have made progress, there are still many remote areas and underserved communities without reliable access to electricity. As of 2017, the World Bank reported that approximately 84% of the global population had access to electricity. However, this figure does not match any of the provided options exactly. The closest option is 'D: 90%' which indicates a high level of electrification but slightly overestimates the actual percentage.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to various studies and research, it has been found that women are generally more prone to mood disorders such as depression compared to men. On the other hand, alcohol use disorder is slightly higher in males than females. Therefore, option B which states 'females are more likely to have depression and are more likely to have an alcohol use disorder than males' aligns best with these findings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Men often face societal pressures and expectations that can contribute to higher rates of depression and alcohol use disorders. However, research has shown that women are more likely than men to experience both depression and alcohol use disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2016, approximately one-third (37.9%) of adults aged 18 years or older were classified as overweight globally. However, this option is not available in the choices provided. Among the given options, 'C' which states '40%' is closest to the actual statistic and therefore can be considered the most accurate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Canada has a large landmass and significant resource extraction industries, which can contribute to substantial CO2 emissions. However, in 2017, Russia was the largest emitter of CO2 due to its extensive fossil fuel production and consumption. Therefore, among the given options, Russia is the correct answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse region with varying economic performances among its countries. While some nations have struggled, others have experienced growth. The Democratic Republic of Congo has faced significant challenges since 1980 but it doesn't represent the entire region. Therefore, the statement that accurately reflects Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole is that 'some countries have had relatively significant growth rates.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous challenges, including poverty, conflict, and limited infrastructure, which can hinder economic development across the region. However, it is not accurate to say that no nation has grown in recent years or that all have experienced significant growth rates. Considering these factors, option D provides a more nuanced view by acknowledging both the positive growth of some countries and the specific situation of the Democratic Republic of Congo.",D
