B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great as someone who believed in leading and driving his nation forward, even using force if necessary. This indicates a ruling style that concentrates power within one individual rather than sharing it with others or relying on democratic processes. Therefore, the term 'Absolutist' best fits this description.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, it emphasizes his determination to lead Russia himself without sharing power or relying on education and persuasion; instead, he was willing to use force if necessary. This aligns more closely with an absolutist ruling style where the monarch holds absolute power.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The speech highlights how African states were disregarded and not respected, particularly in relation to French atomic tests and the U.N.'s response during the Congo crisis. This suggests that France saw Africa as a lesser entity, more prone to anarchy rather than a strong political union or resource for power.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the instability and anarchy in the Congo, implying that France viewed Africa as a collection of fragmented and chaotic republics. This viewpoint is further supported by their indifference to African opposition against French atomic tests and U.N.'s focus on constitutional matters rather than supporting African independence.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter describes a personal account of damage caused to a homestead and farm due to an encampment of natives during the Anglo-Zulu War, which is a conflict involving British imperialism in South Africa. This source provides insight into the impact of colonial actions on local populations and properties. Therefore, it would be most useful for understanding unforeseen consequences of British imperialism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions insurance, property ownership, and farming, all indicative of economic stability and potential prosperity within the British colony. However, it also highlights a conflict with native people causing damage to properties. This suggests that while there may have been some benefits from colonialism, they were overshadowed by negative impacts such as conflicts and destruction caused by imperialistic actions. Therefore, this letter would most likely provide information about the unforeseen consequences of British imperialism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which factor contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during 1750-1900 C.E. Among the options, vaccines for tropical diseases would have been less influential in this period as effective vaccines were not widely available or developed until later. The other choices directly facilitated European exploration and colonization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases would have actually helped Europeans survive better in African environments, not aid their exploitation. Joint-stock companies allowed capital accumulation necessary for colonial ventures, while machine guns were used as tools of conquest during the colonization period. Therefore, the least contributing factor to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa would be vaccines.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the exploitation of Africa through imperialism, highlighting how Europeans extended their economic control over the continent. Among the options provided, trading slaves with European merchants is directly related to this context as it was a significant aspect of the imperialist system that drained African wealth and hindered development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions European involvement in Africa, suggesting that Sub-Saharan Africans sought alliances with European powers to counter threats from Muslim and Arab forces. However, the primary focus of trading contacts during 1450-1750 C.E. was not about population growth or state consolidation but rather revolved around economic exchanges such as slave trade. Thus, option D is incorrect because it does not directly relate to the importance of trading for that period.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the presence and influence of Muslim communities in Hangzhou, China during Ibn Battuta's time (1332-1346 C.E.). It mentions that these communities had their own mosques, cells, and were well integrated into society with respected positions. This indicates active trade links between the Islamic world and East Asia facilitated by nomadic empires of steppe origin, such as the Mongols under Genghis Khan's descendants.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. However, the presence of diverse religions like Islamism, Judaism, Christianity, and others suggests that there was indeed significant interaction between civilizations during this period. Therefore, option A is not supported by the passage. Option B seems plausible as new religious traditions are mentioned, but it doesn't directly address the overall impact on the period. The mention of Muslims in Hangzhou and their influence indicates that steppe nomads (like the Turks) played a role in connecting trade links across Eurasia, making option C the most supported conclusion.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes soldiers being impressed like dogs or chickens, and a son potentially ending up on distant prairies, indicating conscription for military service. This suggests that the Tang society had an emphasis on producing able sons to fulfill these quotas. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's ending suggests a preference for daughters due to the hardships faced by sons in military service, possibly reflecting a period of altered gender dynamics under Empress Wu Zetian's rule. However, there is no direct evidence within this excerpt about traditional gender relations or agricultural work being shared equally between men and women. The most fitting answer based on the context provided would be related to conscription quotas.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how successive kings, Hormizd and Bahram, both conferred high titles and authority on Kerdir, a chief priest, for performing divine services throughout their empires. This indicates that rulers in this period sought to legitimize their rule through religious endorsement rather than military victories or popular consent. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by sponsoring religion and chief priests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription emphasizes the support and respect given to the high priest by successive rulers, implying that their authority stemmed from the consent and approval of their subjects, including religious figures. However, it specifically highlights how these rulers used religion as a means to gain legitimacy for their rule rather than being limited or constrained by it. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent and support of those they governed.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Daoism emphasizes living in harmony with the natural world and following the 'Way' or 'Dao'. The phrase that best reflects this philosophy is one that highlights nature's inherent order and balance, which aligns with Daoist beliefs about simplicity and spontaneity. In this case, the statement about birds and beasts enjoying their existence according to their nature (C) captures these core principles of Daoism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the concept of Heaven rewarding good deeds and punishing bad ones, aligning with the Daoist belief in the balance of nature and consequences of actions. This idea is best encapsulated in option 'D', which directly states that Heaven's ways are not constant but depend on one's virtue.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Aden as a bustling port with diverse merchants, including Indians and Egyptians, who are depicted as pious, humble, upright, and generous despite their wealth. This suggests that the tone of Ibn Battuta's journal reflects how commerce in this region facilitated cultural exchange and understanding among different peoples, rather than focusing on superiority or difficulties due to language barriers or crop production.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The journal entry mentions the immense wealth of some merchants, suggesting a thriving trade based on the overproduction and export of cash crops from the region. This aligns with historical context where Indian Ocean trade was heavily reliant on agricultural products like spices, textiles, and other goods that were in high demand globally. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'The overproduction of cash crops'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the strict regulations imposed on foreign traders in China during the later Ming Dynasty, such as entering names into a book and being confined to their boats outside of town after trade hours. These measures suggest an intentional effort to control and limit contact with foreigners for tax collection purposes rather than outright hostility or indifference towards commerce.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details specific procedures for Portuguese traders, indicating the Ming Dynasty's strong support and organization of commercial activities with foreigners. However, it also highlights strict regulations such as limited time in the city and mandatory record-keeping. These measures suggest an intent to control trade interactions while still allowing them. The inference that best aligns with these details is that the Ming Dynasty sought to regulate trade strictly.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Trent was convened as a response to Protestant criticisms, including those from Martin Luther. One of the key reforms made by the Catholic Church during this council was to address issues related to scripture and its accessibility. They did not accept vernacular translations but instead emphasized Latin for maintaining doctrinal consistency. Therefore, the correct answer is that they rejected scriptures in the vernacular.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's attack on the opulent lifestyle of cardinals and their accumulation of wealth suggests a rejection of the veneration of saints and a focus on worldly matters. The Council of Trent, in response to such criticisms, aimed to clarify Church doctrines and practices. Among the options provided, rejecting saints as intermediaries aligns with Luther's critique and was one of the reforms enacted by the Council of Trent.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech emphasizes the need for Russia to overcome its backwardness and not be exploited or enslaved, which aligns with communist ideology that seeks to eliminate class struggles and create a society where all are equal. The focus on collective strength and unity against oppressors is characteristic of communism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech highlights the historical consequences of Russia's perceived weakness, suggesting a policy of appeasement to avoid further conflict and exploitation. The emphasis on not lagging behind aligns with an approach that seeks to prevent being beaten or enslaved through concessions. Therefore, the answer is 'Appeasement'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Quranic verse warns against indulging in 'strong drink and games of chance', which are considered sinful acts according to Islamic teachings. Omar Khayyam, a Persian poet, contrasts this with the joyous act of pouring wine when roses bloom, suggesting that such pleasures should be enjoyed within their cultural context. This comparison indicates that there were instances where religious restrictions might not have been universally observed by all Muslims.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The verses present opposing views on alcohol consumption, with the Rubaiyat's endorsement potentially indicating a growing trend of atheism or disregard for religious restrictions among some Muslims. However, there is no direct evidence to support that Christian missionaries were winning converts (C) or that intellectuals were generally hostile to traditional practice (D). The most reasonable conclusion from the given verses would be that not all Muslims strictly observed religious prohibitions on alcohol.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Portuguese bring silver from India and other costly items to China, but it does not mention any significant source of additional silver coming from Central Asia, Europe, or the Middle East. However, during this time period (1599 C.E.), there was a large influx of silver into China primarily due to trade with the New World, specifically Mexico and Peru where vast amounts of silver were mined. Therefore, the greatest volume of additional silver came from The New World.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the established trade routes and historical connections, it's likely that the Middle East, with its own sources of silver, contributed significantly to China's silver influx. The passage does not mention Central Asia or Europe as major contributors, but it is known historically that the New World (Americas) was a significant source of silver during this period due to Spanish colonization and mining activities.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal in 1494, dividing newly discovered lands outside Europe along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands off the west coast of Africa. This division aimed to resolve conflicts over newly discovered territories during the Age of Exploration. The Spanish insisted on control of territory west of this line, which included most of the Americas, because they had already made significant discoveries and conquests in these regions. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Spain wanted to secure their claims and prevent Portuguese expansion into areas where they had established settlements or were actively exploring.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's division of territories suggests that Spain believed conquering India would be more challenging than establishing control over the New World, leading them to prioritize the latter. This is supported by historical context wherein Spanish explorers like Columbus and Magellan ventured into the Americas before significant European powers attempted conquests in Asia.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given texts from 'The Epic of Gilgamesh' and 'The Maxims of Ptahhotep' both discuss themes related to the afterlife, divine guidance, and consequences for wrongdoings. These elements are closely associated with beliefs about what happens after death, rather than gender relations, legal norms, or social hierarchy. Therefore, these texts best fit within the context of religion pondering conceptions of the afterlife.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both excerpts describe the consequences of defying divine principles, suggesting that these religious narratives served to reinforce and explain the established social hierarchies and the punishments for transgressing them. Therefore, the texts are best understood in the context of religion being used to explain social hierarchy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the Ottoman Sultan Selim I addressing Shah Ismail of the Safavids, emphasizing religious zeal and expulsion for those introducing evil innovation into their order. This context suggests that the primary issue between these empires was related to religious differences or perceived threats to Islamic orthodoxy. Among the options provided, proclaiming oneself as a Caliph would be most directly linked to such tensions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text condemns 'evil innovation,' which could refer to the Safavids' practice of enslaving Christians and incorporating them into their military forces, a practice seen as heretical by the Ottomans. This action would have directly contradicted Islamic principles, leading to conflict with other Islamic empires like the Ottoman Empire.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions a Jewish trader separated from his wife, indicating that their marriage is strained due to long periods of separation. This suggests that the primary cause of marital strain in this context is likely related to the challenges faced by merchant families during such separations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The husband's mention of returning home 'with nothing' and offering his wife a bill of repudiation implies financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy as the main source of marital stress. This is further supported by the context of being a Jewish trader in India, which was known for its risky trade routes that could lead to economic instability.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the potential benefits of a political union among African states, such as commanding respect and projecting an African personality on the global stage. It criticizes the lack of attention from Great Powers towards African issues like nuclear tests in the Sahara and U.N.'s handling of constitutional matters in Africa. This indicates that Kwame Nkrumah is advocating for a stronger position for Africa, rather than focusing on failed unification attempts or opposing capitalism directly. Therefore, the passage serves as an example of proposing to increase the standing of Africa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the UN's inaction in the Congo and advocates for African unity, suggesting a call for greater UN involvement and intervention in resolving African issues. However, it primarily emphasizes on creating an African political union to enhance Africa's global standing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'A proposal to increase the standing of Africa in the modern world'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The French Revolution was a period of significant political and social upheaval in France, which saw the rise of influential figures who played key roles in shaping its course. Among these figures, Robespierre stands out as one of the most prominent leaders during the Reign of Terror, where he held considerable power. Therefore, the correct answer is Robespierre.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lafayette was a key figure in supporting revolutionary movements, and his involvement in the American Revolution suggests he might have held a similar position in France. However, Robespierre is more directly associated with the French Revolution as one of its most influential leaders during the Reign of Terror. Therefore, among the given options, Robespierre would be the figure who assumed great power.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Nicolo Machiavelli's 'The Prince' emphasizes practicality and realism in ruling, suggesting that fear is a more reliable tool for maintaining power than love due to human nature. This approach contrasts with medieval political philosophy which often incorporated ethical or religious ideologies into governance. Therefore, the correct answer reflects Machiavelli's pragmatic stance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's focus on practical strategies for maintaining power implies a disregard for traditional social structures and a more egalitarian approach to governance. This contrasts with the medieval period, which often emphasized hierarchical class distinctions. Therefore, the correct answer is that it did not rely upon strong concepts of equality across class boundaries.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Sultan Selim I to Shah Ismail I emphasizes religious zeal, extirpation of evil innovations, and expulsion against those who oppose their order. This clearly indicates a focus on maintaining the purity of Islamic practices within their empire, which can be seen as an effort to manage tensions between different religious sects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter highlights internal divisions and the need for drastic measures, suggesting a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and its eventual collapse. This aligns with option C: Factors that brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a kingdom that levies duties on copper and sells it to pagan nations, employing them in gold extraction activities. This suggests an economy heavily reliant on trade connections for the exchange of goods like copper and gold. Therefore, the statement about international trade connections being developed during this period is supported by the passage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Extensive trade networks, as described in the passage, often facilitate the transmission of diseases across different regions and populations. The mention of selling copper for gold to pagan nations indicates active international trade during this period. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that diseases could have spread along these trade routes.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two sources provided discuss the formation of Gran Colombia and the establishment of Brazil as an empire with a constitutional monarchy. Both documents highlight the shift towards representative forms of government, where citizens have a say in their governance through elected officials or monarchs acting within a constitutional framework. This period saw many nations transitioning from absolute monarchies to more democratic systems that included elements of representation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on establishing formal governments and outlining their structures suggests a response to the growing social complexities and demands brought about by industrialization. This period saw significant shifts in political philosophy, with societies demanding more from their governments due to increased urbanization and economic changes. Therefore, the best answer is that industrialization propelled societies to demand more social obligations from their governments.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Mongol Empire facilitated trade and communication across vast territories, including Russia. This would have likely led to increased political organization as part of managing these connections. Among the options given, developing a centralized bureaucracy is most aligned with this idea, as it implies an administrative structure that could manage such extensive interactions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' openness to different faiths likely facilitated the spread of Islam, which eventually became the dominant religion in Russia. However, this was not an immediate consequence of their conquest but rather a gradual process influenced by various factors over time. Among the given options, the most direct and long-term impact mentioned is that Russia developed a centralized bureaucracy as part of its administrative structure under Mongol rule.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how violence was an essential component of British rule in India and that it established a monopoly on violence. It also mentions the Kanpur massacres during the revolt of 1857, where indigenous Indians killed British citizens. From this context, we can infer that those who committed these acts did so as part of their struggle against colonial rule, which they perceived as oppressive and unjust. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the deaths were seen by those who carried them out as a religious duty.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the conflict involved a religious dimension, suggesting the killings at Cawnpore were driven by a sense of religious duty and a desire to re-establish native religions. This aligns with option D, which indicates that those who committed these acts saw it as a religious obligation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness states that necessity compels a man to let his children work, even in places where they are ill-treated or overworked. This implies that the primary motivation is financial need rather than any other factor such as discipline or moderate difficulty of labor. Therefore, the correct answer is B: He doesn't earn enough on his own.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness likely believes that his children need the discipline and structure provided by factory work, even if the conditions are harsh. This suggests a belief in the necessity of such labor for their development or survival, rather than being forced into it by an employer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Purusa was divided into different parts representing various social classes or castes in ancient India. This division is described as a religious sacrifice and integral to the Hindu religion, not just a reflection of its time period or a response to external threats like Muslim invaders. Therefore, it suggests that the caste system had deep roots within the Hindu religion itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The caste system likely emerged as a way to strengthen Hindu identity and unity in the face of challenges from Muslim invaders. However, the passage provided does not directly support this claim. Instead, it describes how Purusa was divided into different parts representing various social classes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Sudras), which suggests that the caste system is deeply rooted in Hindu religious texts and practices rather than being a response to external threats or reinforced by regional princes. Therefore, option D best aligns with the information given.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the slave trade, with prices for different categories of slaves based on age and gender. It specifically mentions that adult males are priced higher than females or children, indicating a preference for male slaves due to their physical strength which was likely needed for labor-intensive tasks. Therefore, the conclusion supported by this passage is that adult male slaves were most highly valued.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that young female slaves fetched higher prices, likely due to their strength and ability to perform demanding physical tasks. This suggests that adult male slaves were not the most highly valued despite being numerous in number. Therefore, option D is incorrect.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the hardships faced by soldiers during the Tang Dynasty, including being impressed into service and facing difficulties in their duties due to unrest and infestations. However, it does not directly mention any changes or differences made by the succeeding Song dynasty compared to the Tang. Among the given options, 'the Song pursued a less expansive foreign policy' is the most plausible answer as it could be inferred from the context of unrest and difficulties faced by soldiers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on the hardships caused by constant warfare suggests a departure from Confucian values and the civil service examination system, which emphasized education and social order. This indicates that the Song dynasty may have made changes to this system.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese emperor expresses no interest in strange and costly objects, stating that they possess all things and have no use for foreign manufactures. This indicates a lack of fascination with the British goods and suggests an offense at what could be perceived as bribing them through these goods. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Offense at a perceived bribe'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's lack of interest in the British goods suggests a recognition of their superior technology and a desire to acquire such advancements for China. However, he explicitly states that they have no use for these foreign manufactures, indicating fascination with their strangeness rather than seeing them as an act of submission or offense. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter is from a Jewish trader in India, which indicates the existence of diaspora communities due to interregional commerce during that time period. It also mentions a marriage and divorce situation, but does not directly address patriarchy or family structure evolution among polytheistic populations. Therefore, the passage best aligns with the formation of far-flung diaspora communities as a result of interregional commerce.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter's discussion of divorce within a Jewish context reflects the evolving family structures and practices among polytheistic populations during this period. It highlights how religious beliefs influenced personal decisions, such as marriage dissolution. Therefore, it best aligns with the evolution of family structure among polytheistic populations.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the position of zamindars in Northern India during the Mughal Empire, highlighting their dependence on paying revenue and how refusing to do so could lead them to establish a claim for sovereignty. Among the given options, 'universal taxation' best aligns with this context as it implies that all subjects were required to pay taxes, which if not paid by zamindars, would allow them to assert their independence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The zamindars' power to claim sovereignty likely stemmed from the Mughal Empire's implementation of suffrage, which empowered local leaders and gave them greater autonomy. This allowed zamindars to refuse or omit paying revenue as a means to establish their independence.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The data shows a significant increase in literacy rates among Russian-speaking populations from 1897 to 1955, which aligns with periods of intense state intervention and modernization efforts in the Soviet Union. This suggests that the information is best understood within the context of centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant rise in literacy rates suggests the implementation of syndicalist economic policies, which often emphasize worker education and participation in decision-making. However, this option is not directly related to literacy improvement. Among the remaining choices, centralized state campaigns for modernization are known to have focused on improving educational standards as a means of socioeconomic development. Therefore, the best context for understanding these changes would be centralized and state-directed campaigns.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of peace, unity among Asian and African nations, and injecting reason into world affairs. These themes align closely with the principles of the non-aligned movement, which sought to maintain neutrality during the Cold War era while promoting cooperation between developing countries. Therefore, the most associated development is the formation of the non-aligned movement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on unity and progress among Asian and African countries aligns with the goals of the Green Revolution, which aimed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce poverty in developing nations. However, his speech specifically mentions 'mobilizing all spiritual, moral, political strength', indicating a broader geopolitical movement rather than just an agricultural one. The passage most closely aligns with the formation of the non-aligned movement, which sought to establish a third path for countries not aligned with either the US or USSR during the Cold War.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss immigration restrictions, specifically targeting Chinese individuals in Australia and Chinese laborers in the United States. These laws were enacted during a period when European and American powers had significant influence over these regions. The broad trend that formed the background for such restrictive legislation was the colonial domination of India and China by European and American powers, which led to tensions and conflicts regarding immigration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The immigration laws described in the passages were likely a response to European and American colonial domination in India and China, as these powers sought to control the movement of people and resources within their empires. This context aligns with option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how European invaders introduced new crops and food sources to America, which likely led to improved nutrition and agricultural diversity in Europe as these goods were brought back. However, the most direct impact mentioned is related to population changes due to disease or immigration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The large-scale export of crops from the New World to Europe likely resulted in food shortages and famine, leading to a decline in the European population. While imported diseases did have an impact on indigenous populations, this question specifically refers to the effect on Europe.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the prohibition of opium in China and its potential harmful effects on mankind, emphasizing that it should not be transferred to other countries, especially China itself. This context suggests a focus on economic interactions between Europe and China, particularly regarding trade practices. Therefore, the most closely related broad development is Europe's economic domination of China.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's condemnation of the opium trade suggests that it was seen as a form of enslavement, with Europeans forcing the Chinese population into addiction and dependence. However, this does not directly relate to colonization or missionary activity. Instead, Lin Zexu's letter highlights the economic exploitation through the opium trade, which fits best with the concept of economic domination.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Mahatma Gandhi's call for boycott of foreign cloth and encouragement towards spinning or weaving, which were part of his Swadeshi movement aimed at promoting Indian goods and self-reliance during the struggle for independence from British rule. This aligns with efforts toward self-rule and independence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the passage likely reflects Indian labor's efforts to improve working conditions and gain greater rights through collective action. This aligns with Gandhi's broader philosophy of non-violent resistance, which included economic self-sufficiency as a means to achieve political independence. Therefore, the best context for understanding this boycott is Indian labor's collectivization and agitation for better working conditions.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from Kerdir's inscription at Naqsh-e-Rustam describes a time when various religious groups, including Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Nasoreans (Orthodox Christians), Christians, Maktak (Baptists), and Manichaeans were present in the empire. This suggests that Persia had interactions with these communities, which likely included Arabian-origin religions such as Islam. The presence of diverse religious groups indicates a level of cultural exchange rather than direct control or infrequent interaction. Therefore, the best description is that Persia was brought into the Arabian religious and cultural orbit over this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages highlight the religious justifications used for warfare, with one source advocating for the spread of Islam through jihad and the other depicting peaceful interactions between Christians and Muslims. This suggests that Persia was not in control or interacted infrequently but rather had a complex relationship involving both conflict and cooperation with Arabian entities over time.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author discusses how Western Europe achieved global hegemony through a 'quantum jump', which involved exploiting resources and assets from other continents. Among the options, the conquest of the Aztec Empire (B) best aligns with this assertion as it would have provided access to vast mineral resources and human assets in the Americas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes the need for resource exploitation from other continents, and Japan's isolationist policies during the Tokugawa period would have provided ample opportunity for such exploitation by Western Europe. Therefore, this choice best supports the assertion about achieving a 'quantum jump'.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great's determination to transform Russia, indicating he sought significant changes in governance and societal structure. Although it mentions constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments in Protestant Europe, it does not explicitly state that Peter embraced these reforms. However, his intent to lead with education, persuasion, and force suggests a centralization of power rather than the creation of an elected assembly or reduction of aristocratic influence. The most fitting answer is the development of a constitutional monarchy, as it aligns with his goal of transforming Russia's governance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to drive Russia forward and his willingness to use force suggest a desire to dismantle the existing power structures, including the aristocracy, in order to implement his reforms. While he was influenced by European ideas of governance, there is no direct mention of creating an elected assembly or declaring human rights. The most fitting answer based on the passage would be reducing aristocratic influence.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages discuss the treatment of Muslim hermits and Christian merchants in different contexts, highlighting how religion influenced interactions between cultures during that time period. This suggests a focus on religious influence rather than justification for violence or proselytization efforts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription clearly demonstrates Persia's strong influence and authority in the region, suggesting that their military and political power would have extended to Arabia throughout the period. This aligns with option A: 'The influence of religion on interaction between cultures', as it shows how religious beliefs were used by rulers like Saladin to justify actions taken against other faiths.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how different regions and groups within the Mughal Empire had varying relationships with revenue collection, influenced by factors such as geography and political circumstances. This suggests that geographical differences played a role in determining which groups paid taxes. Therefore, option B is the most supported generalization based on Moreland's description.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of revenue collection for the Mughal Empire's functioning, implying that it was the primary, if not the only, means by which the empire sustained itself financially. However, it also highlights geographical variations in how different regions and groups interacted with this system. Therefore, while taxation was crucial, the passage suggests that revenue collection's role varied across different areas of the empire.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages discuss the perspectives of two British officials regarding their interactions with Indians and Native Americans in India and North America, respectively. Both emphasize exerting control over these populations through trade policies rather than direct governance or military action. Therefore, the most appropriate context for understanding these passages is the exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the mobilization of military resources was a key strategy employed by colonial powers. The first passage talks about suppressing sati (a practice involving self-immolation) in India under British rule, while the second passage refers to exerting power through trade and goods as a means of control over native peoples. However, neither directly discusses missionary efforts or slavery legalization. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is mobilization of military resources from colonial possessions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman being industrious, correct in manner and upright in character, and continuing ancestral worship through domestic duties such as cleaning, arranging food for offerings, and not engaging in gossip or silly laughter. These expectations align with option A: that women obediently fulfill their obligations within the home.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman's role in supporting her husband and maintaining a harmonious household, suggesting a collaborative approach to domestic tasks and responsibilities. It does not mention education or employment as expectations for women, nor does it encourage boldness in speech. Therefore, the expectation most closely aligned with the passage is that women should work together with their husbands on home duties.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno, as an Asian leader, was concerned with the peace and unity of Asia and Africa during a period marked by global tensions between major powers. The Cold War (C) best fits this context because it involved ideological conflicts and power struggles primarily between the United States and Soviet Union that affected many regions worldwide, including Asia and Africa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on peace and the mobilization of Asian and African nations suggests a direct response to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and its destabilizing effects on the region. This context aligns with his call for the voice of reason in world affairs, making option A the most suitable answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech highlights Russia's history of being beaten due to its backwardness in various aspects, including military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural sectors. Stalin emphasizes the need for progress and not lagging behind anymore. This context aligns with his efforts to modernize and strengthen the Soviet economy through systematic planning and development. Therefore, the speech is best understood in the context of Stalin's implementation of five-year plans for the Soviet economy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's focus on rapid industrialization and his fear of falling behind suggest a strong motivation to develop nuclear weapons as a means of ensuring the Soviet Union's security and dominance on the world stage. The speech emphasizes catching up with other nations, which aligns most closely with the goal of becoming a nuclear nation.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the management and control over colonized populations, with one emphasizing strict rule through force (a rod of iron) and the other mentioning trade as a means to establish dependence. These approaches align more closely with colonial techniques involving companies rather than direct crown rule or complete privatization. Therefore, the correct answer is that both authors served institutions associated with the chartering of companies to assume costs and share profits.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages emphasize the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the imposition of martial law and the presence of large armies were common colonial techniques. The first passage discusses suppressing a cultural practice in India, while the second one talks about controlling trade with indigenous people through forceful means. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C' which refers to martial law enforced by sizable armies.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first letter from King Afonso I expresses concern over people being seized and sold to Europeans, indicating a negative impact on his kingdom due to European activities. This suggests that the tone reflects resistance against these expeditions rather than dependence or establishment of trading posts. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The king's complaints about the kidnapping of his people and their sale into slavery indicate a strong resistance against European attempts to conquer and colonize the region. This aligns with option B, which suggests vigorous resistance to European expeditions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal, dividing newly discovered lands outside Europe along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. This division allowed Portugal to claim territories east of this line, which included parts of Africa, Asia, and later Brazil in South America. The primary motivation for Portuguese control over these areas was their desire to establish trade routes with India and other lucrative markets in Asia, particularly spices. Therefore, the most accurate inference is that Portugal sought a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese were known for their pursuit of wealth and resources, and the lands of Mexico, with their abundant gold and silver, would have been a highly desirable territory for them to control. This aligns with historical context where Portugal sought new trade routes and territories rich in valuable commodities. Therefore, the most plausible inference is that Portuguese insistence on controlling territory east of the demarcation line was driven by their desire for wealth from Mexico.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions zamindars who paid revenue to the Mogul, indicating their economic role and political status during that period in Northern India. Considering the religious context of the region at that time, it is most likely referring to Hindu aristocrats as they were prominent landowners under the Mughal rule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in the context of land and revenue, and since peasants are typically associated with agricultural activities and land cultivation, it's reasonable to assume that zamindars were a type of peasant class within the Mughal Empire. However, the text specifically mentions their position of dependence on paying revenue to the Mogul, which suggests they held some form of authority or status over the lands they managed. Among the options provided, Hindu aristocrats are most likely to fit this description as they were known for land ownership and managing agricultural activities in Northern India during that period.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects Albert Camus' existentialist philosophy, which questions the meaning and purpose of life in a seemingly indifferent universe. This aligns with modernist tendencies that challenge traditional faith-based moralities and seek to understand human existence through rational inquiry rather than religious dogma.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the devastation and loss of faith caused by World War II, many people turned back to traditional religious values for comfort and guidance, and Camus' exploration of meaning and the human condition reflects this trend. However, his questioning of absolute truths and moral absolutes aligns more closely with modernist thought, which often challenges established belief systems. Therefore, the passage exemplifies a modernist tendency to question faith-based morality.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how various tribes, including the Bructeri, were driven out or exterminated by neighboring tribes with Roman involvement in some cases. This indicates that incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire played a significant role in its decline. However, the persistence of the senate as a body of government is not mentioned and does not directly contribute to the decline described in the passage. Therefore, option C contributes least to the decline of the Roman Empire.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the constant threat posed by barbarian incursions and intertribal conflicts, suggesting that these external pressures were the main cause of the Roman Empire's decline. Among the options given, the persistence of the senate as a body of government (C) is not mentioned in the passage nor typically considered a direct contributor to an empire's decline.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses a 'quantum jump' that Western Europe achieved through exploiting resources, which led to their global hegemony. This exploitation likely improved agricultural and industrial productivity, resulting in more plentiful supplies of food. Therefore, the most direct contribution would be an increase in population due to better food availability.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The exploitation of resources and the rapid increase in productivity often lead to social unrest and inequality, as different groups compete for access to wealth and power. However, the passage specifically mentions that this 'quantum jump' led to Western Europe's dominance through geographical luck and ecological factors rather than direct causes like trade route collapse or population increase due to food supply. Therefore, the most directly related development is an increase in social unrest.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both Source 1, from Martin Luther King Jr.'s letter, and Source 2, the Statement of Purpose from the National Organization for Women (NOW), emphasize that while discussions are important, they must be accompanied by practical actions to bring about change. In Source 1, King talks about creating tension through nonviolent direct action as a means to confront and address issues like prejudice and racism. Similarly, NOW's Statement of Purpose highlights the need for concrete action beyond discussions to achieve equality for women. Therefore, both sources explicitly emphasize the need for practical steps alongside discussions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. All three sources advocate for social justice and equality, and achieving such goals often requires building alliances and solidarity with other movements fighting for similar causes. Source 1 discusses the role of nonviolent action in creating tension to address issues like racism, while Source 2 emphasizes taking concrete actions towards gender equality alongside ongoing discussions. Source 3 explicitly mentions forming a strategic alliance between gay liberation and women's liberation movements. Therefore, both sources highlight the importance of unity with other movements.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Upanishads, a part of Hindu scriptures, emphasize self-realization and understanding as paths to transcendence beyond reincarnation. Buddhism also shares this viewpoint but diverges in its doctrine on karma and the cycle of rebirth (Samsara). Both traditions agree that knowledge and wisdom lead one away from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach about reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of this cycle of rebirth is to reach a state of enlightenment and ascend to a heavenly realm. However, both religions also emphasize the concept of karma, which states that one's actions in their current life will determine their fate in future lives. Therefore, Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation most resembled Hinduism in retaining the concept of karma.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the responsibility of preventing an inhumane practice, sati, and emphasizes that it is not desirable to put British authority at risk while doing so. This suggests a motivation focused on ending the ritual without compromising their own position. Therefore, option B best aligns with this reasoning.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The British were predominantly Christian and often sought to spread their religion in their colonies, so their opposition to the sati ritual likely stemmed from a desire to convert the Indian population to Christianity. However, the passage also emphasizes the importance of maintaining authority over India, suggesting that ending this practice was part of broader colonial objectives rather than solely religious ones.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Maynard Keynes is known for his belief in government intervention to stabilize economies and maintain aggregate demand, especially during economic downturns. Considering Bismarck's concerns about worker security and the insufficiency of help provided to poor workers, it aligns with Keynesian principles that suggest proactive measures by the government to address such issues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Keynes generally cautioned against excessive government intervention in the economy, believing that market forces should play a primary role in regulating economic activity. However, he also recognized the need for some level of government involvement to address issues like unemployment and poverty. In this context, while not directly advocating for extensive government intervention as per option A or B, Keynes would likely agree with the sentiment that society should provide support to workers facing insecurity, but he might be more cautious about direct government involvement than suggested by options A and B.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text emphasizes the consequences of wrongdoing, moral behavior affecting one's fate after death, and guidance from gods for successful passage in life. This aligns with ancient Egyptian beliefs about Ma'at (truth, balance, order) and its impact on an individual's journey through the afterlife. Therefore, the hypothesis that best reflects this influence is that moral behavior affected one's fate after death.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text clearly emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, suggesting that ancient Egyptians were deeply committed to elaborate rituals and offerings to appease their gods. This aligns with option D, which states that worshippers in Ancient Egyptian society committed to an elaborate set of rituals and offerings.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the fatwas of Sunni scholars, consensus in the Sunni community, and references to Shi'a teachings from Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). This indicates that Ismail I's empire was predominantly influenced by these Islamic sects. However, considering the context of fatwas and consensus among scholars, it is more likely referring to Sunni traditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the removal of ""evil innovation,"" which aligns with the Sikh tradition of extirpating hair as a way to dedicate oneself to God. However, considering the historical context and religious affiliations of Shah Ismail I, who established the Safavid dynasty in Persia, it is clear that his empire was characterized by Shi'a Islam.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how different regions, Europe and China, adapted their military strategies based on their unique threats during a specific historical period. This reflects upon why European states developed certain technologies (like gunpowder weaponry) that eventually led to their military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly compares the different approaches to gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, highlighting how societies strategically shared and adapted technologies based on their specific needs. This directly relates to the question of technology sharing between societies.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'what the world whispers' in this context refers to subtle, indirect actions or attitudes that reflect a global stance on South Africa's apartheid regime. It implies that while there may be overt condemnation ('the world declares with snarling guns'), more nuanced forms of discrimination and opposition exist as well. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'The world engages in subtler forms of discrimination.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet contrasts the world's quiet disapproval of apartheid with South Africa's blatant actions, suggesting that the global economic system indirectly promotes and benefits from South Africa's discrimination. Therefore, 'what the world whispers' refers to how the world economy subtly supports apartheid.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the ruler, despite his virtuous actions and attempts to follow the example set by previous kings, still faced calamities from Heaven due to past sins of his ancestors. This suggests that he had lost the blessing or favor of the gods, which aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the former kings of Xia faced calamities due to their lack of virtue. This implies that the current ruler, who inherited their legacy, likely met a similar fate as a result of natural disasters. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'He was killed as a result of natural disasters.'",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Nicolo Machiavelli's perspective on leadership, emphasizing that people are ungrateful and can turn against a ruler when it suits them. This viewpoint reflects cynicism about the loyalty of subjects to their leaders. Therefore, option A best characterizes Machiavelli's attitude in this passage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's argument about the importance of fear over love in maintaining control clearly reflects a criticism of the religious establishment's reliance on faith and devotion, which he sees as unreliable tools for governance. However, his primary focus is not directly criticizing religion but rather emphasizing practical political strategies. Therefore, the best characterization of Machiavelli's attitude in this passage would be a criticism of the religious establishment.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for an option that would best contradict the argument of rigid economic and social roles imposed by the caste system between 600 BCE to 600 CE. Option D, which states that Shiva is considered as creator, preserver, and destroyer, does not directly address or challenge the concept of a rigid caste system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Krishna, mentioning four divisions created by him, reinforces the idea of a rigid caste system where individuals are born into specific roles with limited social mobility. This directly contradicts the argument that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society during 600 BCE to 600 CE.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's message refers to the Swadeshi movement, which aimed at promoting Indian goods and rejecting British products during the struggle for India's independence. Among the given options, World War II (D) had a significant impact on colonial powers like Britain, weakening their ability to maintain control over colonies such as India. This historical context most assisted the ultimate success of the boycott mentioned in Gandhi's message.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott's success was undoubtedly influenced by the decolonization process already underway in Africa, as it inspired and empowered Indians to resist colonial rule and demand independence. This context provided a conducive environment for Gandhi's non-violent resistance movement.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Bonesteel's efforts to establish a surrender zone in Korea, indicating that the United States and Soviets were involved in negotiations during this period. However, there is no indication of close camaraderie or enmity between them. Instead, they appear as parties with distinct interests trying to reach an agreement. Therefore, 'Distant strangers' best describes their relationship.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly depicts the US and Soviets working together to manage the surrender of Japanese forces, demonstrating their close collaboration and shared goals as comrades-in-arms. Therefore, option B best describes the relationship between the United States and the Soviets in this context.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights how different geopolitical threats influenced the development and focus on military technology in China versus Europe, with each region adapting its strategies to their specific needs. This suggests that traditional views of technological advancement may not fully account for these regional differences. Among the given options, choice D most directly challenges a common narrative by implying that China's lack of progress was due to ignoring technology rather than other factors.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archers over gunpowder was a strategic choice based on their specific threats. This challenges the view that China's progress was hindered by religious fundamentalism, which often opposes technological advancements. Instead, it highlights how geopolitical factors influenced China's approach to technology.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the need for unity among African states, emphasizing common purpose and planning to overcome colonial consequences. It specifically mentions Ghana's president advocating for this idea at an international organization. This aligns with Pan-Africanism, which promotes solidarity between all people of African descent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's call for African unity highlights the limitations of individual states and emphasizes the need for collaboration, suggesting a neocolonial approach where African nations work together under the guidance of former colonial powers. However, his focus on uniting Africa to achieve common goals aligns more closely with Pan-Africanism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The quoted passage from the Upanishads speaks about Brahman, which represents the ultimate reality or divine spirit in Hinduism. It mentions an afterlife and a connection to this spiritual entity beyond life itself. This suggests that there is belief in an afterlife within this religion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's belief in an afterlife and the emphasis on faith suggest that salvation in this religion is achieved through right actions and right speech, earning favor with the gods. However, the passage does not mention rituals or polytheism as key elements of their religious practice.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck, a German statesman, was concerned about worker insecurity and poverty due to illness or old age. His speech led to the creation of social welfare laws that aimed at providing support for workers during these vulnerable times. Among the options given, establishing public health care and pensions directly addresses the issues mentioned in Bismarck's speech.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's concern for worker insecurity and the lack of social safety nets clearly indicates that the resulting laws aimed to limit work hours in factories, providing workers with more stability and protection. This aligns most closely with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem reflects an appreciation and admiration for New York, using vivid imagery to describe the city's beauty. This suggests that the poet is influenced by transatlantic connections between art in Afro-Eurasia and America. Therefore, the best explanation for this phenomenon is stronger transatlantic influences linking art across continents.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet's lyrical portrayal of New York likely stems from the outmigration of Africans escaping political violence and seeking new opportunities in the United States, leading to a blending of cultural influences. This migration resulted in stronger transatlantic connections between artistic traditions across Afro-Eurasia and the Americas.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The third stanza discusses the demand for land tax from District Officers and the difficulty in sourcing it, indicating a heavy reliance on agricultural production as a source of revenue. This suggests that advanced agricultural technologies would be necessary to support such demands. Therefore, the poem provides direct evidence for relatively advanced Tang agricultural technologies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of widespread conscription and tax collection suggests a relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, with a large population concentrated in cities, necessitating a strong bureaucracy for efficient administration. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949, is a collective defense agreement among its member countries. Article 5 specifically states that an armed attack against one or more members will be considered an attack against all and necessitates mutual assistance to restore security. This clearly indicates the primary purpose of signing was for protection against potential threats from opposing states.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty's emphasis on collective defense and the potential use of armed force suggests that it was signed in response to the monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities held by certain nations, prompting others to form an alliance for protection. Therefore, option D is the most accurate explanation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song is referring to historical events where Ferdinand, not the 'Winter King', became Bohemia's lawful king. Rhine and Prague were significant locations within the Holy Roman Empire during this time period. Therefore, mentioning these places serves as a warning for the Winter King to stay away from them due to his loss of power in those areas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator's reference to Rhine and Prague suggests these are significant locations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage, possibly seeking redemption or spiritual guidance after his defeat. However, considering the context of a seventeenth-century song where political power is at stake, it can be inferred that these places hold strategic importance rather than personal significance to the king.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Both sources emphasize the importance of holy images in Christianity, with Source 1 discussing their role as a 'memorial' and Source 2 highlighting their significance in representing the incarnation of God. Among the options provided, Sunni Islam is known for its aniconism, which opposes the use of religious images. Therefore, it aligns most closely with being ideologically opposed to these sentiments about holy images.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages advocate for the use of holy images as tools for religious understanding, which directly contradicts the principles of Buddhism, a religion that emphasizes meditation and inner reflection over external representations. Therefore, among the given options, Buddhism is ideologically opposed to these sentiments about the use of holy images.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The United Nations, as mentioned in Article 1, is focused on peaceful means for settling disputes and refraining from the use of force inconsistent with its purposes. This aligns most closely with providing avenues for arbitration of international disputes. Therefore, the correct answer is an organization dedicated to providing avenues of arbitration of disputes for nations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of the United Nations in the treaty suggests it is an organization dedicated to asserting a particular ideological tenet over the world, promoting its values and principles as the basis for international relations. This aligns with the UN's mission to maintain international peace and security, promote justice, and foster cooperation among nations.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given passage from the Upanishads describes Brahman as omnipresent and encompassing all aspects of existence, including desires, perfumes, tastes, and even silence in love. This aligns with the concept that Brahman is found everywhere and contained within everything.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Brahman as a spirit residing within the hearts of individuals, suggesting that he is found in a specific location, similar to the concept of Heaven in other religions. However, it emphasizes his omnipresence and universality, stating 'He contains all works and desires and all perfumes and all tastes' and 'He enfolds the whole universe'. This aligns with option A which states that Brahman is found everywhere and contained in everything.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Mongol Empire facilitated international contact and exchange of goods, ideas, and inventions across its vast territory. It also mentions that they allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. This information aligns with option A, which states that both the Mongols and Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of various religions and their vast empire encompassed diverse belief systems, likely leading to the creation of a new syncretic religion. On the other hand, Persia was historically characterized by its monotheistic Zoroastrianism before Islam became dominant. Therefore, option D is the most accurate comparison between the Mongol and Persian empires.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem references saxophone laughter, a musical instrument associated with jazz music, and the creation story in six days which is reminiscent of biblical narratives often found in Romantic literature. However, the specific mention of 'saxophone laughter' strongly points towards the Jazz Age as it was during this time that jazz became widely popular. Therefore, the imagery in the poem is most likely inspired by the Jazz Age.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on nature, emotions, and vivid imagery aligns with the core principles of the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism and a connection to the natural world. Additionally, references to jazz elements like 'saxophone laughter' suggest an influence from the Jazz Age. However, considering the overall tone and themes, the Romantic movement is more likely to have inspired this imagery.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther criticized the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its practices and wealth accumulation through church positions like cardinals. Among the reformers listed, John Wycliffe is known for his early criticism of the Church's corruption and advocacy for scripture in vernacular languages, which aligns with Luther's views on challenging the established religious authority. Therefore, the correct answer is John Wycliffe.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther were key figures in the Protestant Reformation and challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, so their views must have been similar. Sir Thomas More was a staunch defender of the Catholic Church, while Erasmus sought reform within it but did not break away from it like Luther. John Wycliffe is known for his early criticism of the church's practices and wealth, which aligns with Luther's concerns about cardinals acquiring riches through ecclesiastical positions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a ritualistic sacrifice involving Purusa and how different parts of him were apportioned among various classes in society after the division. This highlights the significance of sacrifices to the gods within Hinduism, as it was believed that these offerings led to the creation of worlds and other important aspects of life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sacrifice that leads to the creation of the world and different castes, suggesting that good deeds and sacrifices are essential for achieving enlightenment and improving one's karma. However, it primarily focuses on the act of sacrifice itself as an integral part of Hindu religious practices. Therefore, this passage can be used to explain the importance of sacrifice to the gods.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses themes of existential uncertainty, human condition, and the search for meaning beyond one's own understanding - all central ideas in Existentialism. Albert Camus is a well-known philosopher associated with this movement, particularly through his work 'The Myth of Sisyphus'. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's questioning of meaning and the nature of existence aligns with the principles of New Age syncretism, which seeks to blend various spiritual and philosophical perspectives. However, Albert Camus is more famously associated with existentialism, a movement that emphasizes individual freedom, choice, and subjective experience in finding meaning.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how neighboring tribes, presumably barbarians, were driven out and exterminated by a civilized society (Romans) for various reasons including plunder and rivalry. This aligns with option D where host societies invite barbarian peoples to rule instead of their own ruling classes, as it involves interaction between the two groups that could lead to similar outcomes such as conflict or displacement.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the conflict between barbarian tribes and the Roman Empire, suggesting that barbarian peoples were often converted to Christianity as part of their integration into Roman society. This is similar to earlier periods where conversion was a common practice for assimilating barbarian groups. Therefore, option A best reflects this historical pattern.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a British citizen suing for damages caused by natives during the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879, which indicates that European settlement occurred prior to this event. Among the options provided, the most plausible reason for large-scale European migration to Zulu lands before 1867 is related to economic opportunities such as a diamond rush.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference established clear boundaries and regulations for European colonization in Africa, making it easier for Europeans to move to Zulu lands and establish settlements. This historical event aligns with the context of the letter from 1879 during the Anglo-Zulu War.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Olympe de Gouges discusses her disappointment in not achieving the expected outcomes of independence, such as education for her children and overall societal change. This aligns with option D which states that French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the disappointment and frustration of women who had hoped for greater equality after the French Revolution, suggesting that their status actually declined as they faced continued discrimination and exclusion from political life. This aligns with option D, which states that French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to the 'Winter King', a title given to Frederick V, who was elected as Bohemia's king but faced opposition from Ferdinand II. This conflict arose due to disagreements over royal succession and religious affiliations between Protestantism (supported by Frederick) and Catholicism (supported by Ferdinand). However, the primary issue highlighted in this song is related to the rules of royal succession.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The song's mocking tone and criticism of the ""Winter King"" suggest underlying social class conflicts and resentment towards the privileges and authority of the ruling elite. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Social class conflicts'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem emphasizes the resilience, love, and enduring spirit of Latin America despite numerous invasions and challenges throughout history. It also highlights the cultural richness inherited from ancient civilizations like the Incas and Aztecs. Therefore, the statement that best reflects the theme is that Latin America has survived many invaders and will continue to do so.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem acknowledges the power and influence of the United States while emphasizing the resilience of Latin American culture, suggesting that change and progress are inevitable, even if they come through external forces. However, it does not suggest that Latin Americans should fight back or that their culture has already been destroyed. Instead, it highlights the enduring nature of Latin America's spirit despite numerous invasions.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, a prominent African leader, emphasizes the importance of unity among African states to command respect and avoid disunity-related dangers. He criticizes the lack of attention from Great Powers towards African issues like French atomic tests in the Sahara. This advocacy for unity aligns with Pan-Africanism ideology which promotes solidarity between all people of African descent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's emphasis on African unity and self-determination aligns with the principles of neocolonialism, which sought to maintain European influence in Africa through economic and political partnerships. However, his call for a united African identity and resistance against external interference more closely reflects Pan-Africanism.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a ruler who appoints his commander based on valor and success in battle, indicating that merit is valued for such positions. This suggests a system where individuals are chosen for their abilities rather than birthright or clan affiliation. Therefore, the best evidence from this text is of meritocratic appointments by rulers to their bureaucracies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a champion representing his tribe and seeking to take the narrator's cattle, indicating that clans were the basic political units in Egyptian society and played a significant role in conflicts and rivalries. This suggests that the correct answer is 'The clan as the basic political unit'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpts from Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth both reflect the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity that were central to the French Revolution. These values are rooted in Enlightenment thinking which emphasized reason, science, and individualism over tradition. Therefore, the intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions, including the French Revolution, can be best associated with the Enlightenment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were influenced by the principles of mercantilism, which emphasized economic competition and the accumulation of wealth through trade and colonization. The quotes from Dickens and Wordsworth reflect on the societal changes brought about by these revolutions. Therefore, the intellectual foundations that most directly relate to the eighteenth-century political revolutions are mercantilism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese traders carrying goods from various regions, including silver from Japan and India, to China. This indicates that Europeans were actively participating in East Asian trade patterns during this time period. Therefore, option C is the most directly supported historical development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese trade route between Macao and Japan, highlighting the exchange of goods and the presence of Portuguese merchants, which suggests the influence of Jesuit missionaries who often accompanied traders and facilitated cultural exchange. However, this information does not directly support any of the given historical developments related to trade patterns or competition among European powers in East Asia.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses opium, which is prohibited in China but being exported to other countries, including Britain. Lin Zexu criticizes this practice as hypocritical and harmful. He does not mention Confucian teachings or military power directly, nor does he focus on the balance of trade. Therefore, the author's appeal primarily rests on the inconsistency between China's own laws and actions regarding opium.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes China's economic and moral superiority over Britain, suggesting that Britain should fear the potential military consequences of its harmful opium trade and China's righteous anger. However, his primary argument is based on hypocrisy; he points out that while opium is banned in China, it is still being sold to other countries by Chinese merchants. This highlights a double standard in the behavior of foreign traders towards China.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a situation where children are working in poor conditions due to necessity, implying minimal government intervention and regulation on businesses and labor practices. This aligns with the laissez-faire philosophy, which advocates for limited government involvement in economic affairs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system with minimal government intervention in business and labor practices, aligning with the principles of corporatism, where the state and corporations work together to regulate the economy and social affairs. However, this description does not fit laissez-faire perfectly as it implies some level of cooperation between the state and businesses rather than complete absence of government intervention.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh conditions and exploitation faced by indigenous people in the silver mines, including forced labor without pay, debt accumulation due to unpaid expenses for food and lodging, and collusion among mine owners and colonial officials. This indicates a system where social hierarchy is determined by birthplace or origin, leading to significant inequality and exploitation of indigenous people.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in Spanish South American mines, indicating that the king of Spain was likely unaware of or unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects in the colonies. This suggests a lack of interest from the monarch regarding the welfare of these individuals.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the French Revolution and the American Revolution were driven by a desire for change in their respective societies. The key similarity between them, as mentioned in both passages, is that they were responses to unfair systems of taxation which burdened the common people while benefiting the elite class. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were fueled by discontent with the power and influence of religious leaders, who often held significant political and economic authority, similar to the challenges posed during the Protestant Reformation. This commonality makes 'The privileges and influence of religious leaders' the correct answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar was a key figure in the independence movements across Latin America, particularly known for his role in liberating several South American countries from Spanish rule. The passage discusses the complexities of fighting for liberty and establishing governance after being oppressed by colonial powers. Among the options provided, Bol\u00edvar's most notable accomplishment was indeed uniting various independent states into a single entity, which later became Gran Colombia. Therefore, the correct answer is 'The first union of independent Latin American states'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes Simón Bolívar's mixed-race identity and his struggle against both Spanish rule and native resistance, suggesting that he likely led a political coup to challenge the existing power structures and assert the rights of mixed-race individuals. Among the given options, the first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent is most closely aligned with Bolívar's historical actions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta was a Muslim traveler who explored various regions, including India and China during the 14th century. Zheng He, Marco Polo, and Xuanzang were also famous travelers in their respective eras. However, Lorenzo de Medici was an Italian statesman and patron of arts during the Renaissance period, which is significantly different from Ibn Battuta's experiences as a Muslim explorer. Therefore, his experiences are least similar to those of Lorenzo de Medici.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. Marco Polo also traveled widely but his journeys occurred in a different era and region compared to Ibn Battuta's Arabian world. Lorenzo de Medici was an Italian statesman and not known for traveling extensively like the others, making him less likely to share experiences with Ibn Battuta. Xuanzang traveled from China to India during roughly the same time as Ibn Battuta but his primary focus was on religious pilgrimage rather than trade or exploration of diverse cultures. Therefore, Lorenzo de Medici's experiences were least similar.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes that Western European capitalists actively exploited Africa, draining its wealth for their own benefit. Among the choices given, option A directly relates to this point as it describes an aggressive expansion of slave trade, which was a significant form of economic exploitation and resource drain by Western Europeans.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. However, Walter Rodney specifically points to Western European capitalists as responsible for extending their exploitation across Africa. Among the options provided, the establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company (D) is directly linked to Western European capitalist activity and colonial expansion in Africa.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is written by Sim\u00f3n de Bol\u00edvar, a key figure in South American independence movements. It discusses struggles for ownership and liberty against invaders, which align with the historical context of Latin American countries fighting for their independence from European powers. Therefore, the political movement best understood in this passage is the fight for independence in South America.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text clearly describes a population seeking self-governance and resisting external control, aligning with the concept of political autonomy. Bol\u00edvar's message to Congress in 1819 was part of his efforts to liberate South American colonies from Spanish rule. Therefore, the passage is best understood within the context of the fight for independence in South America.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how neighboring tribes helped exterminate other tribes, either out of hatred or for plunder. This suggests a strategy where empires may have encouraged rivalries among barbarian peoples to reduce threats and maintain peace within their own borders. Therefore, the most directly supported conclusion is that empires encouraged rival tribes to destroy one another.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that empires benefited from the influx of barbarian peoples who could contribute to the empire's workforce and economic growth. It also mentions how these tribes were driven out or exterminated, but it does not explicitly state this as a strategy for reducing threats or expanding influence through military force. The passage doesn't mention religion either. Therefore, the most directly supported conclusion is that empires welcomed migrations of barbarian peoples.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The literacy rate increased significantly from 24% in 1897 to 99.90% in 1955 under both Leninist and Stalinist regimes, indicating substantial educational reforms and achievements during their rule. A historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would likely highlight these accomplishments rather than focusing on the negative aspects or comparing with other countries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The dramatic rise in literacy rates suggests that the Soviet Union's communist system was more effective in achieving its goals compared to other communist nations like China. A historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would likely highlight these achievements, despite acknowledging any abuses.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii's letter highlighted the threat of Western powers due to their technological advancements, suggesting Japan should modernize or risk calamity. The most fitting response among the options is that Japan sought knowledge from these very Western powers to understand and potentially adopt their systems.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To address the concerns about foreign powers, Japan likely needed to completely reform its outdated systems, starting with the Chinese-style civil service. However, Lord Ii himself was a proponent of modernization and openness to Western ideas. The most fitting response among the options is that Japan sent emissaries to study western democracies and industry.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States both aimed to restrict immigration, particularly targeting specific ethnic groups like Chinese laborers. These acts were driven by concerns over social order and economic impacts related to immigrant populations. Therefore, these passages best exemplify a hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment during that period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the selective nature of immigration policies, aiming to attract skilled workers while restricting the entry of unskilled laborers. However, these acts were primarily driven by concerns over social and economic impacts rather than a desire for specific skill sets. The Chinese Exclusion Act was specifically targeted at Chinese laborers due to perceived threats to local order and economy. Thus, the most appropriate answer is 'Hardening of anti-immigrant sentiment.'",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E. is known for initiating the First Crusade, which aimed to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy lands from Muslim control. The text mentions that Jerusalem seeks aid because it is held captive by enemies who do not know God, indicating a conflict with non-Christian forces in the region. Among the options provided, the invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks fits this context as they were responsible for taking control over parts of Byzantine territory and posed a significant threat to Christian pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire. Pope Urban II's speech at Clermont was primarily aimed at rallying support for the First Crusade against these invaders in Anatolia. Therefore, the event that most directly inspired Urban's call is related to this context.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong emphasizes the need for a socialist transformation in agriculture to address the issues arising from capitalism and inequality among peasants. The passage specifically mentions eliminating rich-peasant economy and individual economy, which implies collective ownership of land rather than private property. Therefore, the best explanation aligns with this concept.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The socialist transformation likely involved a shift of agricultural workforce towards industrial centers, contributing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. However, Mao Zedong emphasizes the worker-peasant alliance and collective efforts in agriculture rather than individual ownership or surplus investment. Therefore, option A best aligns with his concept as it describes a process where excess labor from rural areas contributes to fueling urban industrialization.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The literacy rates depicted show a significant increase over time, especially among those who would have had access to education and resources for learning. Considering that urban areas typically offered better educational opportunities compared to rural regions during this period in Russia/Soviet Union history, the segment of the population most likely to benefit from rising literacy rates would be the urban middle class.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increased literacy would greatly benefit the clergy, allowing them to better interpret and disseminate religious texts and teachings to the population. However, considering the socio-economic context of late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, where education was a tool for social mobility and industrialization, the urban middle class likely benefited most from rising literacy rates as it enabled them to participate more actively in economic activities and governance.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a ruler who gained favor and authority through military successes, indicating that victories against outsiders were significant for leaders in early civilizations to establish their legitimacy. This aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflicts between states primarily served to provide the victors with a source of slaves and resources, which were crucial for sustaining their agricultural systems and economies. While other options may have some relevance in certain contexts, they are not as universally applicable to early civilizations as option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the significance of a woman being industrious, upright in character, and maintaining purity to avoid disgrace. These principles align with patriarchal values that prioritize female virtue and obedience within ancient societies. Therefore, the theme common in patriarchal ancient societies as presented here is 'The importance of female purity'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage underscores the importance of women fulfilling their roles in maintaining the household and upholding ancestral traditions through rituals and offerings. It emphasizes on purity, quietness, and systematic arrangement as key virtues for a woman to be respected and not bring disgrace upon herself or her family. Among the given options, 'The importance of female purity' is most closely aligned with these themes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question describes a situation where the U.S. was concerned about limiting Soviet occupation in Korea during World War II, which aligns with later Cold War policies aimed at preventing further spread of communism. Among the options provided, 'Containment' is the policy that directly addresses this concern by seeking to stop the expansion of Soviet influence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concern over Soviet expansion aligns with the Cold War strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, where the threat of retaliation deterred aggressive actions. However, this policy is not directly related to limiting territorial occupation. Détente refers to easing tensions between superpowers and does not specifically address territory control. Dollar Diplomacy involves using economic power for influence but doesn't fit the context. Containment was a strategy aimed at preventing Soviet expansion, which aligns with Bonesteel's concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviets would occupy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Winston Churchill's speech was delivered during World War II, specifically after the fall of France to Nazi Germany in June 1940. His words reflect determination and defiance against the Axis powers, particularly Nazi Germany. The context is not about trade deals or support for resistance movements but rather a rallying cry for British resilience against an imminent threat. Therefore, the speech best fits within the context of Britain's fears about a possible invasion attempt by Nazi Germany.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. However, considering the context of his speech and the historical events that followed, it is more appropriate to understand this as a call to action in response to Nazi Germany's aggressive expansionism and potential invasion threats.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Portuguese trade with China and Japan, focusing on silver from Japan and India. Among the options given, the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (1603 C.E.) led to a period known as Sakoku or 'closed country,' where Japan severely restricted foreign influence and trade, particularly with European nations like Portugal. This policy directly undid the open trading patterns mentioned earlier.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and subsequent control over trade routes in the Pacific likely disrupted the established trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan. However, considering that the passage specifically mentions the Portuguese bringing silver from India to China, it is more directly related to their own expansionist activities rather than those of Spain or other nations mentioned. The establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan would have a significant impact on trade patterns as well since it led to sakoku (closed country) policy isolating Japan and limiting foreign influence.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage describes a situation where Christians treat Muslim hermits kindly and allow Christian merchants to travel freely in Muslim territories during the crusading era, which contradicts traditional assumptions about religious conflicts at that time. This suggests that personal or economic interactions were not always influenced by state-level antagonisms. Therefore, option A is the most suitable answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims. This indicates a contrast in behavior based on religion rather than economic or political factors. Therefore, the correct answer is C: showing how Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the issue of sati, a practice that was prevalent among some Indian communities and considered repugnant by European colonizers like William Bentinck. His stance on suppressing sati indicates an interference with native religious practices to protect innocent lives. This challenges the commonly held assumption that all Western imperialism was solely driven by profit or cultural imposition, as it shows a willingness to intervene in local customs for moral reasons.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage demonstrates that European colonizers often intervened in the religious practices of native populations, as seen in the example of the suppression of sati. This action directly challenges the commonly held assumption that all cultural norms were imposed uniformly and eagerly on native populations without exception.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The fifth paragraph in Gandhi's message emphasizes boycotting foreign cloth and promoting self-reliance through spinning or weaving, which aligns with the Swadeshi movement aimed at reviving domestic products and reducing dependence on foreign goods. This movement was a response to British colonial rule and economic exploitation, particularly after the partition of Bengal in 1905. Among the options provided, the development of joint-stock companies (B) most directly relates to this context as it facilitated European imperialism and trade dominance during that period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The call to boycott foreign cloth likely drew inspiration from the historical experience of India under the rule of Muslim empires, where local industries suffered due to competition from imported goods. Gandhi's emphasis on Swadeshi (self-sufficiency) and Hindu-Muslim unity suggests a response to economic policies that disadvantaged Indian producers during this period.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage describes how violence was an essential component of British rule in India, with power insisting on its exclusive monopoly over violence. It also mentions that the revolt shattered this monopoly and manifested superiority through denying Indians a 'humanness'. This context suggests that the Cawnpore Massacre can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the Cawnpore Massacre was a brutal event, it might be understood within the context of local military customs and traditions, which may differ from Western norms. However, the passage emphasizes that British rule in India relied on a monopoly of violence and treated Indians as inferior races. The massacre can thus be seen as a reaction to this systemic brute force exerted by the British.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby discusses the need for a society to increase its productivity drastically, exploiting resources from other continents, and mentions Western Europe as an example due to geographical luck. This context aligns with the colonization of new lands where such resource exploitation could occur. Therefore, the most likely development Crosby is responding to in this period would be the colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby's argument likely refers to the Industrial Revolution, where European nations needed vast resources and markets to fuel their industrial growth, leading to the exploitation of other continents. The colonization of North and South America fits this context as it allowed Western Europeans access to these resources and new markets.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the natives were forced to pay yasak tribute in various forms, including sables and red foxes. It also states that there are now no sables and not many foxes left due to overhunting. This directly correlates with the burden faced by native Siberians trying to fulfill their obligations as they have fewer resources available for tribute.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline in fur-bearing animals likely resulted from competition with Russian hunters and trappers who also sought these valuable resources, making it difficult for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. This is supported by the mention of 'pawned horses', which suggests that hunting was a significant part of meeting yasak tributes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's call to power emphasizes the urgency of seizing control for the sake of revolution and societal change, specifically mentioning peace offerings, salvation from famine, and land transfer to peasants. These themes align with Marxist ideology which advocates for a proletariat-led revolution against capitalism. Therefore, the principal philosophical underpinning is most likely Marxism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's emphasis on seizing power and controlling resources aligns with the core principles of capitalism, where individuals strive to maximize their own wealth and control over the economy. However, in this context, Lenin is advocating for a shift away from capitalist structures towards a system that prioritizes collective ownership and distribution of resources. This indicates his support for Marxism, which seeks to establish a classless society through revolutionary means.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the Sharpeville massacre, where police fired into a crowd of unarmed black South Africans protesting against apartheid laws. This event is highlighted as symbolizing oppression and racial dominance in South Africa. Among the given options, the election of Nelson Mandela marked significant progress towards ending institutionalized discrimination by leading to negotiations that eventually dismantled apartheid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Boer War, with its focus on racial tensions and power struggles, ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a more equitable society in South Africa. However, it was not an event that symbolized the end of institutionalized discrimination but rather one of many conflicts leading up to it.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Malians are Muslims who keep up their prayers and study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) diligently. These practices indicate a serious commitment to their faith, making option B the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the Malians' openness to friendships between men and women outside of family, demonstrating their commitment to inclusivity and tolerance, which are central tenets of Islam. However, it specifically mentions that they 'keep to the prayers', study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learn the Qur'an by heart, indicating a serious adherence to religious practices. Therefore, their faithfulness in studying Islamic law is the strongest evidence of taking their Muslim faith seriously.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the French Revolution, emphasizing the need to suppress both internal and external enemies for the Republic's survival. It specifically mentions 'terror', which is described as a consequence of democracy applied to urgent needs. This context aligns most closely with counterrevolutionary opponents who would oppose revolutionary changes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against the enemies of the Republic suggests a fear of communist agitators who aimed to overthrow the existing social order and establish a classless society. The passage does not mention foreign invaders, counterrevolutionary opponents or transnational corporations as threats.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great as someone who did not share power with his people and believed he must lead Russia's transformation, even using force if necessary. This indicates a desire for change rather than maintaining existing practices. Among the options given, 'Decentralization of power' is inconsistent with this approach since it implies sharing or distributing power among various parties.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to modernize Russia and his willingness to use force suggest a belief in decentralizing power and empowering the people to participate in the decision-making process. However, he did not return with an intention of sharing power but rather aimed at leading the transformation himself. Among the given options, 'Reform' is most closely related to his actions as it encompasses changes made by a ruler or government.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Confucian teachings emphasize respect for elders and proper conduct towards them, which aligns with maintaining a structured society. The quote from the Analects highlights rituals associated with serving parents, indicating an established social order. Therefore, these teachings were used to reinforce social hierarchy.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Confucius' teachings on filial piety, with their emphasis on respect for parents and elders, aimed to promote gender equality by ensuring that both sons and daughters had equal responsibilities and rights within the family structure. However, in a broader societal context, these teachings were primarily used to reinforce social hierarchy, as they underscored the importance of maintaining order through respect for authority figures such as parents and elders.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh conditions faced by indigenous people in silver mines, including forced labor, lack of payment for work, and exploitation through various means such as food deductions. These practices contributed to the decline of native populations due to poor living conditions and debt. Therefore, the most directly supported conclusion is that the population of the Americas declined during this period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment of indigenous populations and the disruption of their traditional ways of life, clearly demonstrating the dramatic alteration of New World religious traditions and social customs due to European influence. This directly supports conclusion C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speech is delivered by Pope Urban II in 1095 C.E., calling for a holy war to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control and restore Christian dominance. This historical event aligns with the Crusades, which were military campaigns sanctioned by the Latin Church during the medieval period. Therefore, the context of this speech is best understood in relation to The Crusades.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe. However, this speech specifically refers to a religiously motivated military campaign known as the Crusades, which aimed at reclaiming Jerusalem from Muslim control during the Middle Ages.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Sadler Committee testimony from 1831–32 discusses the conditions of child labor and working hours, which were prevalent during the Industrial Revolution. Labor unions emerged as a response to such exploitative practices, advocating for better wages, reasonable work hours, and improved working conditions. Therefore, among the given options, labor unions are the most likely organization responsible for these improvements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Joint-stock companies, with their focus on collective ownership and shared profits, played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and improving working conditions during the Industrial Revolution. The Sadler Committee testimony reflects concerns about child labor and poor working conditions that were addressed through efforts by organizations like joint-stock companies.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes unity, common purpose, and planning as essential for African states to overcome colonial rule and achieve progress. Among the options provided, armed intervention from Cold War superpowers (C) is historically known to have disrupted political aspirations in Africa during that era. This external influence often overshadowed internal efforts towards unity and development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Africa's struggle to achieve unity and progress can be attributed to its shortage of natural resources, which limited its economic potential and hindered its ability to compete on the global stage. This factor was more significant in preventing the fulfillment of political dreams described in the passage than other options.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong emphasizes on co-operation and eliminating rich-peasant economy in order to consolidate worker-peasant alliance, which indicates a move towards collectivization of land as a means to reduce inequality between sectors of the population. Therefore, the best context for this quotation is governments promoting collectivization of the land.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's concerns about the growing wealth gap and the potential for social unrest indicate a move towards liberal political and economic reforms, aimed at empowering individuals and fostering economic development. However, his emphasis on cooperation and collective efforts suggests that he is advocating for policies to reduce inequality between sectors of the population through land collectivization rather than promoting capitalist or industrialization-focused strategies.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers, particularly those from Shanxi province, who are being impressed into service due to high demand for troops in the west. It also mentions the burden of land tax on the peasantry and their discontent with having sons conscripted instead of daughters. These details suggest that the major cause of later Tang decline was the discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation, as it directly affected their livelihoods and family structures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of constant warfare and the hardships faced by soldiers suggest that foreign invasions and the need to defend the empire's borders were major contributing factors to the decline of the Tang dynasty. However, Du Fu specifically mentions 'the land tax', which indicates a burden on the peasantry due to oppressive taxation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the need for socialist transformation in agriculture, cooperation among peasants, and elimination of individual economies to improve rural living conditions. This aligns with Mao Zedong's vision of communism and its implementation in China during that period. Therefore, it contributed most directly to the decline of Soviet-style communism and the rise of Maoism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation of the peasant economy and the focus on collective farming methods directly contributed to the Green Revolution, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity and improve food security through technological advancements and modern farming techniques. Therefore, the most direct contribution is related to the development of more efficient agricultural techniques.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a slave trade caravan operating in Algeria during the 1830s, where slaves were bought and sold at various prices based on age, gender, and beauty. Given that this activity took place in North Africa (Algeria), it is most likely that these captured slaves would be destined for locations within or near the region, such as harems or homes of local elites. The other options are geographically distant from Algeria during that time period and do not align with the historical context provided in the passage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high value placed on young women and the brutal treatment of the slaves, it is likely that they were destined for cotton plantations in North America, where slave labor was extensively used in the cotton production process. The other options do not align with the historical context or the details provided in the passage.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a democratic system where social standing, class considerations, and poverty do not hinder one from participating in public life if they are able to serve the state. However, it does not mention women being allowed to participate. Therefore, based on this information, only adult men who were citizens by birth could participate in the Greek democratic process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the inclusive nature of Athenian democracy, where all adult men and women who were citizens by birth had the right to participate in the political process and contribute to the governance of the state. Therefore, the correct answer is that both adult men and women born within the geographic boundaries of the state could participate.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker in the second passage expresses disappointment that despite gaining independence, there has been no significant change for women and peasants. This suggests a lack of progress in areas such as education and social reform. Among the given options, 'Prioritization of national liberation over social reform' best aligns with this sentiment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's disappointment likely stems from the new elites' resistance to women's rights and their reluctance to implement social reforms that would empower women and improve their status in society. This aligns with Olympe de Gouges' call for equality, suggesting that despite achieving independence, societal progress regarding gender equality was hindered by the new elites.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the commitment of parties to settle disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions and promote stability, as well as maintain collective defense in case of an armed attack against any party. This aligns with the concept of 'collective defense', where countries agree to defend each other in case one is attacked.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, with its emphasis on collective action and mutual aid against threats, aligns with the principles of communism, where nations work together to achieve common goals and defend against external aggression. However, this treaty specifically focuses on defense cooperation among Western countries during the Cold War era, which is not a concept inherent in communism itself but rather an application of collective security measures.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the advancements in foreign states, particularly their military capabilities and navigation technology during the mid-19th century. This era is associated with Japan's encounter with Western powers and subsequent modernization efforts. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Meiji Restoration,' which marked a period of rapid industrialization and political reform in Japan.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concerns about foreign advancements and the need for modernization suggest that the era following the passage is the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period marked by Japan's isolationist policies and resistance to external influences. However, this context actually refers to the time before the Meiji Restoration when these issues were being discussed as warnings of potential future threats.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 1, Hitler criticizes the Treaty of Versailles as an 'impossible position' forced upon Germany and proclaimed under duress. This indicates that he believed it was unjust or unfair to Germany at the end of World War I. Therefore, the historical background for his condemnation is a widespread belief in Germany that they had been treated unfairly after WWI.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hitler's strong opposition to the Treaty of Versailles was rooted in his belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated and that Germany had a right to reclaim lands lost after World War I. The speech emphasizes the perceived unfairness of the treaty, which imposed harsh penalties on Germany. Therefore, the correct answer is Hitler's belief regarding Poland's borders.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that China faced threats from highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons were ineffective due to their unwieldiness. Therefore, it is logical for them to focus on improving horse archer units better suited to combat these foes rather than investing heavily in less effective weaponry.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese failure to innovate in gunpowder weaponry can be attributed to their overconfidence in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces, leading them to believe that further technological advancements were unnecessary. However, the passage states that they focused on improving horse archer units instead due to threats from highly mobile steppe nomads.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the struggles and unfulfilled expectations of individuals post-revolution, with Olympe de Gouges discussing women's rights and Halima Ghomri reflecting on Algeria's war of independence. While both texts do not directly address economic improvement or unequal distribution of liberties, they imply that the revolution did not fully meet their expectations for a better life. Therefore, option D is most closely aligned with these sentiments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri experienced disappointment and lack of improvement in their lives after their respective revolutions, which suggests revolutions generally fail to benefit women and minorities. While other options could be inferred from the passages, option B directly addresses this issue.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages provided are from two prominent figures in the history of medicine: Paul of Aegina, a Byzantine physician, and Ibn Sina (Avicenna), an Islamic scholar. Both works showcase medical knowledge that was preserved and expanded upon during this period through translations and commentaries by scholars who had access to Greek texts. This indicates the influence of Greek science on European medicine via Byzantine and Islamic intermediaries, rather than direct contact with Mesoamerican or Chinese civilizations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Aegina and the Mediterranean, which are close to Mesoamerica, indicating a possible influence of Mesoamerican science on European medical practices. However, there is no direct evidence in these passages about such an exchange during 600-1450 C.E., making this option less likely. The texts refer to Ibn Sina and Avicenna, who were Persian scholars influenced by Greek science through Islamic civilizations. This influence is well documented as the translation movement in Baghdad brought many Greek works into Arabic during that period. Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting cultural exchange from this time frame would be the transmission of Greek medical knowledge to Islamic and subsequently European scholars.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided sources discuss Russia during World War I, with Tsar Nicholas II expressing concerns about internal troubles and the need for a victorious end to the war. Lenin speaks of the government tottering and the necessity of seizing power. These references point towards significant challenges faced by the country at that time, including military losses and social unrest among the working classes. Therefore, large-scale military losses and resentment of the working classes best align with the context of Nicholas II's abdication.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nicholas II mentions the 'happiness of the people,' suggesting that economic prosperity and dissatisfaction with the aristocracy led to his abdication. However, Source 2 from Lenin emphasizes military losses and working-class resentment as key factors for seizing power. Considering both sources together, it's clear that large-scale military losses and discontent among the working classes were significant reasons behind Nicholas II's decision to abdicate.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 explicitly mentions that while Catholicism is the prevailing religion in Brazil, followers of other religions are allowed to worship within their households or specific houses for that purpose, as long as it doesn't show externally. This indicates a level of religious tolerance during this period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Brazilian constitution mentions a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion as the religion of the Empire, suggesting a connection between religious authority and the divine right of monarchs. This implies that during this period, religious authority was indeed considered foundational for legitimizing rulers.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poet highlights the long history of Latin American civilizations, their poetic traditions, and their knowledge of astronomy to emphasize the depth and richness of its cultural heritage. This serves as a contrast to Roosevelt's viewpoint on America at that time. Therefore, the purpose is to showcase Latin America's long-standing cultural wealth.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of consulting the stars and having poets since ancient times suggests that Latin America has a history of scientific inquiry and astronomical knowledge. However, these references are more indicative of a rich cultural heritage rather than specific scientific contributions or prophecies. Therefore, the poet's purpose in discussing this aspect is to highlight Latin America's long-standing cultural depth.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'his Indians' in the quote refers to a historical practice where European colonizers were granted control over indigenous populations, often requiring them for labor and resources. This system is known as the encomienda system, which was prevalent during Spanish colonial rule in America.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The nobleman likely had indigenous people working for him as apprentices, learning agricultural techniques in exchange for food and shelter. This practice is known as the encomienda system, where Spanish settlers were granted control over native populations to use their labor.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Bahr [al-Fava'id] emphasizes that a Muslim ruler's primary duty is to prosecute jihad and bring about victory for Islam, even suggesting death over peace with infidels. This highlights the seriousness of holy war in the eyes of some Muslim elites during the crusading era.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the duty of jihad and the goal of bringing the world under Islamic sway, indicating that many Muslims during the Crusades were inherently violent and driven by their faith to conquer others. This aligns with option D which states that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The fourth paragraph emphasizes non-violence and peaceful resistance, which are key principles of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy. This message was sent during a time when India was fighting for independence from British rule. Therefore, the instructions to remain non-violent most likely inspired the independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance likely inspired the Zionist movement, as they both employed civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve their goals. However, the text specifically mentions 'The Pilgrims' March', which is a reference to India's struggle for independence from British rule. Therefore, it most directly influenced the independence movements in southeast Asia.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Tale of Sanehat is an Egyptian poem from the Middle Kingdom, which predates the New Kingdom era (1550-1069 B.C.E.). Therefore, it does not directly describe the foreign policy of the New Kingdom. However, examining the historical context, we know that during the New Kingdom, Egypt engaged in conflicts with various neighboring powers for control over strategic regions like Syria and the Levant. Among the options provided, war with the Hittites over these areas is historically accurate.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions a champion of Syria, which suggests a conflict with the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. This aligns most closely with option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from 'Journey to the West' describes an imaginative scenario involving Xuanzang and his prayer, which is not historically documented as part of his actual journey or accomplishments. This fictional element adds complexity for historians trying to separate factual history from literary embellishments.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt was written centuries after Xuanzang lived, making it unreliable and irrelevant to understanding his actual career. However, the text does not necessarily fictionalize or cast doubt on his existence; rather, its late composition adds a layer of complexity for historians trying to separate fact from fiction.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a philosophical concept from the Upanishads, which are ancient Indian texts that form part of Hinduism. Emperor Ashoka is known for his conversion to Buddhism and subsequent promotion of its principles throughout his empire. Among the options provided, only 'The official encouragement of Buddhist edicts' aligns with this historical context.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the self and controlling the mind, which aligns with Ashoka's efforts to eradicate traditional Hinduism and promote Buddhism. However, it does not mention any armed force used for this purpose. Instead, Emperor Ashoka is known for his official encouragement of Buddhist edicts after converting to Buddhism himself. Therefore, the correct answer reflecting a change in Indian religious practice under Ashoka's rule would be the promotion of Buddhism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the sultan of Mali collected duties on copper and sold it to pagan nations in Sudan, where gold was extracted from pits. This indicates that there were international trade relations involving mineral resources between Mali and Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, option B is most supported by the passage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the extraction of gold from pits, indicating that Mali possessed advanced mining technologies that contributed to its wealth. However, there is no mention of bronze tools or specific religious taxation related to unbelievers with minerals. The most supported inference based on the information provided is that international trade involved exchanging these mineral resources.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem is written by Ruben Dario, a Nicaraguan poet who was known for his passionate defense of Latin America against U.S. imperialism. The mention of 'Spanish lion', 'America that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love' and the reference to historical figures like Montezuma and Cuauhtémoc suggest a critique of U.S. interventionist policies during the early 20th century, particularly those related to Latin America. Among the options provided, U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence (Option C) is most closely aligned with this theme.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's themes of resistance against a powerful invader and the mention of 'barbarous soul' suggest it was written in response to the Haitian Revolution and the fight against French colonialism. Therefore, the most likely event that prompted this piece is U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter describes damage caused by a group of natives, which can be interpreted as an act against British citizens and their property during the Anglo-Zulu War. This incident could have been used to justify military action or establish a casus belli (a justification for war). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that such incidents were used by the British government to issue a casus belli to go to war with the Kingdom of Zulu.",A,Let's reason step by step. The British government used incidents like the one described to justify taxing the Zulu kingdom and demanding reparations for damages caused by their actions. This aligns with historical context where colonial powers often sought financial compensation from indigenous populations following conflicts or destruction of property.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the construction of Uruk, including its walls and temple dedicated to Ishtar. This indicates that ancient cities like Uruk had significant religious structures where deities were worshipped. Therefore, the statement about ancient cities featuring areas for worshipping their patron deities is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the passage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage focuses on the impressive walls and ramparts of Uruk, suggesting that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications and were vulnerable to attacks. However, it also mentions Ishtar, a patron deity, indicating that worship areas existed in these cities. But the primary emphasis is on the city's defenses rather than religious structures or training grounds for armies.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The song is from the seventeenth century and references 'Ferdinand', who was a Catholic king of Bohemia, as well as 'poor Winter King'. Given these historical context clues, it can be inferred that the narrator would most likely identify as Protestant, since they are singling out Ferdinand's rightful claim to the throne in contrast to his rule.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song criticizes the 'Winter King' for snatching the crown and emphasizes the legitimacy of Ferdinand as the rightful king, suggesting a conflict between Muslims and Christians during this period. However, given that the song is titled after Frederick (Frederick III), who was Holy Roman Emperor and not associated with Islamic rule, it indicates Protestant sentiment against him. Therefore, the narrator would most likely identify as a Protestant.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, was an agreement between Spain (King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella) and Portugal to divide newly discovered lands outside Europe along a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands. This treaty clearly indicates that monarchs were directly involved in voyages of discovery as they sought to establish clear boundaries for their respective territories, which is reflected in option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty focuses on dividing newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal, which suggests it was related to the trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. This division allowed these countries to establish colonies in different parts of the world, facilitating the slave trade.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe the Cawnpore massacres during the Indian Revolt of 1857, where British colonizers were targeted and killed along with civilians. This event was a result of an uprising against colonial rule rather than socio-economic breakdown or collateral damage from weapons of mass destruction. The violence described aligns most closely with state-sponsored campaigns, as the British had established a monopoly on violence in India and were seen as superior rulers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe violence and massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, suggesting that banditry due to socio-economic breakdown was a significant issue in colonial India. However, the focus on systematic destruction of white men, women, and children indicates an organized effort rather than random acts of violence. Therefore, 'State-sponsored campaigns of genocide' is the most fitting answer as it reflects the deliberate nature of these actions by those seeking to undermine British authority.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Mansa Musa, ruler of Mali, collected a significant amount of gold through mining copper and extracting it from pits in his kingdom. This indicates that the wealth of Mali was largely derived from its natural resources, specifically minerals. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Mansa Musa's control over 'pagan nations' and the slave trade, suggesting that Mali's wealth primarily came from the exploitation of the slave trade. However, it specifically highlights the extraction of gold from mines as a significant source of revenue, with no mention of agricultural estates or conquests for tribute collection. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Mali's wealth was largely derived from its mineral resources.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that soldiers were summoned to 'hunt the idolatrous Koholanes', a term used pejoratively for black Africans, which implies a religious undertone in their actions against these people. This statement directly connects the Arab slave trade with religion as it indicates they considered those being hunted as idolaters or worshippers of false gods.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the capture of a large number of women, indicating that the Arab slave trade was primarily driven by the demand for female slaves for domestic and reproductive purposes. However, the statement 'All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes' directly refers to religious motivations behind the slave hunting mission, as it specifically mentions hunting those considered 'idolatrous', which implies a religious justification for their enslavement. Therefore, this statement best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The sources provided discuss the formation of two different nations: Gran Colombia and the Empire of Brazil. Both documents outline fundamental laws that were established to govern these new entities, indicating a transition from colonial rule towards independence. This process is typically initiated by movements within the colonies themselves rather than external forces or indigenous groups. Therefore, the most direct cause for creating these constitutions would be nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism and local revolts against colonial powers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The documents likely arose from colonial powers guiding their colonies towards self-governance, as they outline frameworks for independent republics. Source 1 discusses the unification of Venezuela and New Granada into a single Republic called Colombia, while Source 2 outlines Brazil's transition to an independent empire with its own constitutional monarchy. Both documents reflect transitions from colonial rule towards independence.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses non-alignment and cooperation with all states, regardless of their economic system or ideology. This implies that it refers to a period where multiple nations were interacting without aligning strictly along Cold War lines. Therefore, the competing ideologies mentioned are most likely those from the Cold War era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation mentioned likely refers to the alliances formed during World War I, where countries with different ideologies collaborated against common enemies. However, the context of neo-colonialism and foreign investment in less developed countries suggests that it is not about direct military collaboration but rather economic relationships. Among the options provided, 'The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa' best fits this scenario as it directly relates to historical colonial competition which aligns with Nkrumah's discussion on neo-colonialism and foreign investment.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The period between 1450 and 1750 C.E., known as the Age of Exploration, was marked by significant advancements in navigation, weaponry, and commerce that facilitated European expansion. However, steam-powered technologies were not developed until much later during the Industrial Revolution (late 18th century). Therefore, this option contributed least to Western European global hegemony within the specified timeframe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gunpowder technology was primarily a medieval advancement, so it wouldn't have significantly contributed to European hegemony between 1450 and 1750. Steam-powered technologies were not developed until the late 18th century, making option C irrelevant for this time period. Joint-stock companies played a significant role in financing voyages of exploration and colonization during this era. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe (the Columbian Exchange) had profound impacts on European population growth and economic development, contributing to their global dominance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Rome declined due to various factors, including military discipline issues and reliance on foreign soldiers. While cultural assimilation (A) and state support of religions (B) could be traits of some empires, the text specifically mentions a relaxation in military discipline and an influx of barbarians, which aligns with option D - government bureaucracies based on merit principle.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Classical empires often supported foreign religions to appease conquered populations and ensure stability within the empire. This practice is evident in the Roman Empire, as described in Gibbon's work, where they provided state support for various religious practices.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes a kingdom where the king and his interpreters are Muslims, but it also mentions that the common people continue to practice polytheism. This indicates that while some elites converted to Islam, the lower classes maintained their traditional beliefs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muslim merchants likely adhered to strict religious principles, refusing to engage in trade with individuals outside their faith. However, the excerpt specifically mentions that while some elites converted to Islam, the common people of these kingdoms remained polytheists and retained their traditional beliefs. This indicates a selective conversion among the ruling class rather than universal adherence or forced assimilation into Islamic practices.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The song is titled 'Poor Winter King', referring to a historical figure, and the lyrics mention Ferdinand as Bohemia's lawful king. This context aligns with the Thirty Years' War, where Ferdinand II of Bohemia was involved in conflicts over religious authority. Therefore, this war inspired the composition of the song.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The song likely refers to the War of Spanish Succession, a conflict over who would inherit the Spanish throne, impacting various European powers. This war involved many key figures and events that could have inspired such a lament for 'Winter King', Ferdinand II of Bohemia.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The verses from the Quran and Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t both mention 'roses', 'bloom', and 'wine'. These elements are associated with beauty, pleasure, and indulgence in sensory experiences, which can be seen as a form of personal behavior. Therefore, the verses relate most closely to religious regulation of personal behavior within Islamic society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both verses address the production and consumption of food and drink within Islamic societies, highlighting regulations and cultural practices. The first verse from the Quran advises against indulging in alcohol (a form of 'wine'), while the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t poem celebrates the blooming roses as a time to pour wine. These verses do not directly address economic processes, gender relations or general personal behavior regulations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes a city in Yuan China where various religious groups, including Muslims and others, coexist peacefully with their own institutions like mosques, cells, colleges, and even have separate divisions within the city. This indicates that there was an environment of religious tolerance during this period. Therefore, the observations expressed are best seen as evidence for policies of religious toleration.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of Muslim communities and their influence suggests that foreigners likely held significant administrative positions in Yuan China. This is further supported by the mention of 'elders of Islamism', 'great merchants', and a division including Jews, Christians, and Turks. Therefore, the best evidence from this excerpt points to the instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how Marco Polo was received and honored by the grand Khan, highlighting a sense of cultural assimilation and respect for different languages and customs. This suggests that the Mongol Empire had an approach to conquest that differed from other empires which often imposed their culture or religion on conquered peoples. Therefore, the best answer is that the Mongols generally ignored or assimilated to the cultural identities of those they conquered.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' vast empire and efficient postal system suggest they often took over territory peacefully, establishing order and communication networks. This is different from other empires that frequently caused destruction during conquests. Therefore, the best answer reflecting this unique characteristic of the Mongol Empire is their ability to conquer without major bloodshed.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the decline of Rome due to factors such as internal corruption, military discipline relaxation, and invasion from barbarians. These reasons can also be applied to other classical empires that faced similar issues. Among the options given, Han and Gupta were both ancient Chinese dynasties known for their eventual fall due to internal strife, corruption, and invasions by nomadic tribes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The factors leading to the Roman Empire's decline, such as overexpansion and internal strife, are also applicable to other classical empires like the Qin and Etruscan. These empires faced similar issues of corruption, military weakness, and external invasions that contributed to their downfall.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah was a prominent leader in Ghana during the decolonization period, advocating for independence and self-governance from colonial powers. His writings on neo-colonialism address the continued economic control of less developed countries by former colonizers even after political independence. Therefore, his work is most closely related to the process of decolonization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writing likely emerged during the Industrial Revolution, as he criticizes the exploitation of less developed nations by industrialized powers. However, his focus on non-alignment and national planning suggests a direct response to decolonization efforts post World War II when many countries sought independence from colonial rule. Therefore, the best context for Nkrumah's writings is Decolonization.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Mongol Empire as a vast realm that promoted peace, trade, and cultural exchange among diverse civilizations. It mentions how merchants, travelers, and embassies moved across their well-policed domains without fear for their lives or property, facilitating the spread of foods, inventions, and ideas. Among the options provided, religious tolerance is directly mentioned in the passage as a characteristic of the Mongol Empire during its peak power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. However, there is no direct evidence linking this directly to their legacy. On the other hand, the passage mentions that different religions were tolerated during the peak of the Mongol empire, which aligns with option D. Therefore, religious tolerance seems to be a more prominent and well-documented legacy from the Mongol Empire.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Sassanid Empire was strategically located along the Silk Road, which connected it to India where Buddhism originated and flourished. This geographical position facilitated cultural exchanges between Persia and India, including religious ideas such as Buddhism. Therefore, the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia can be best explained by its location along these trade routes that allowed for interaction with Indian culture.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Persia's location on major trade routes between India and the West likely facilitated the spread of Buddhism and the establishment of Buddhist communities within the empire. The excerpt does not mention any active conversion efforts or religious tolerance specifically towards Buddhists, making options A and D less plausible. While apocalyptic messages can influence religious movements, there is no evidence in this text to support option B.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem uses vivid imagery, metaphorical language and references African culture (Senghor being a Senegalese poet), which indicates an attempt to incorporate non-Western perspectives into Western literary forms. This aligns with the modern cultural development of non-Western authors adapting Western styles for their own expression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem likely served as a form of political propaganda, advocating for racial equality and social justice within a specific context. It does not directly address avant-garde literary styles or the horrors of World War I. Instead, it highlights Senghor's unique perspective as an African poet in New York, using Western literary forms to express his cultural identity and political views.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong emphasizes that cooperation among peasants is crucial for their well-being, which aligns with socialist transformation in agriculture and industry. Option C directly contradicts this as it states the establishment of cooperatives led to famine and poverty, undermining the hopes expressed by Mao.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. However, Mao emphasized cooperation and eliminating individual economies to improve rural wellbeing. Therefore, silencing opposition contradicts these goals and undermines hopes expressed in the passage.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, outlines the principles and commitments among its signatories in case of an armed attack against any member state within Europe or North America. It emphasizes collective defense and mutual assistance to restore security in these regions. Therefore, it is most clearly a response to aggression from outside Western Europe.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty likely aimed to maintain the balance of power in Europe by creating a system of alliances and deterring potential aggressors. However, it explicitly states that an armed attack against one or more parties would be considered an attack on all, indicating collective defense rather than secret agreements. This aligns with option D: A response to aggression from outside of Western Europe.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was a significant piece of legislation that restricted immigration from China, aiming to preserve the racial homogeneity and economic interests of the United States at the time. This act can be seen as an early form of official initiative targeted towards excluding specific ethnic groups from entering the country. Among the options provided, 'The Australian Migrant Exclusion Campaign' is most closely related to this theme of restricting immigration based on nationality or race.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act aimed to diversify the Australian economy by attracting skilled laborers from various European countries and limiting unskilled labor. However, it specifically targeted Chinese immigrants due to perceived threats to social order. This act is a precursor to more restrictive policies like The White Australia Policy which sought to exclude non-European migrants altogether. Therefore, the first passage can be regarded as the cornerstone of 'The White Australia Policy'.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck, a prominent figure in German history, is known for his social welfare programs aimed at addressing the grievances of workers as described in this excerpt. These policies laid the groundwork for modern social security systems and influenced other European countries to develop similar programs. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's social welfare programs likely led to a decrease in German economic output due to increased taxes and regulations on businesses. However, the most significant long-term effect of his speech was the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe as he pioneered these initiatives.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Colonel Bonesteel was making decisions in the 1940s, which is after World War I and before World War II. During this time frame, Korea was under Japanese occupation until the end of World War II when Soviet forces entered North Korea as part of the Allied victory over Japan. Therefore, the correct answer is that it was World War II.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a consequence of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict with implications for territorial control in Asia. However, considering the time frame mentioned (the 1940s), World War II is more relevant as it directly preceded and influenced geopolitical dynamics in East Asia. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was part of their broader strategic objectives during this period.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria was a stern warning against the opium trade, which he argued was harmful to China and its people. However, this did not lead to an immediate halt of the opium trade or drastic actions such as expelling all foreigners from Chinese territory. Instead, it escalated tensions between China and Britain, eventually leading to military conflict. Therefore, the most accurate outcome following Lin Zexu's letter is a naval defeat for China and new trade terms more favorable to the West.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter likely aimed to expel all foreigners from Chinese territory due to their involvement in the opium trade and its harmful effects on Chinese society. However, this did not immediately lead to a violent uprising or an immediate ban of the opium trade. Instead, it escalated tensions that eventually led to military conflict between China and Britain. Therefore, the most accurate outcome following Lin Zexu's letter is the eventual Chinese naval defeat and new trade terms more favorable to the West.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that natives are struggling to fulfill their tribute obligations due to the depletion of fur-bearing animals, lack of horses for hunting, and forced payments in non-traditional forms like cash. Among the options provided, epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers would have a significant impact on native populations' ability to work and fulfill obligations due to illness and death.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the scarcity of fur-bearing animals, which suggests a change in the environment like global warming that makes it harder for the natives to hunt and pay tribute. However, epidemic diseases brought by settlers would directly affect the native population's ability to fulfill their obligations due to illness or death.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the presence of Muslim communities and their interactions with the Ming Dynasty, including trade activities. Among the options provided, the one that aligns best with historical records is that the Chinese government restricted foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities during the Ming Dynasty. This policy was implemented to control and monitor international trade.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes wealthy merchants with significant influence, suggesting that Confucian principles were relaxed to allow merchants a greater role in government. However, the Ming Dynasty is known for its strict trade policies and isolationist stance, which included restricting foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities. Therefore, option A aligns with historical facts about Chinese trade policy during this period.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the prohibition of opium in Britain and its harmful effects on mankind, implying that it is a substance being exported negatively. Lin Zexu's complaint focuses on this issue as he highlights China's exports to foreign countries are beneficial, contrasting with the detrimental impact of opium. Therefore, the most likely prompt for his complaint would be the British sale of opium in China.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the British for introducing a harmful drug to China, and since heroin is a well-known dangerous drug, it's likely the source of the complaint. Opium was historically used in Britain but not mentioned here; tobacco and gunpowder are less relevant as they don't fit the context of 'poisonous drug'. Therefore, the most probable answer is British encouragement of heroin use.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Chinese emperor's indifference towards European goods and his desire for peaceful relations through submission to their Throne, indicating that China was not interested in importing foreign products or establishing colonies elsewhere. However, this period marked a significant shift in global trade dynamics as silver flowed from Europe to China due to the high demand for Chinese goods like silk and porcelain. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the influx of silver into China due to European demand for goods, and Portugal's early trade presence likely led to their increased power and prestige. However, it does not directly discuss Britain or Japan in relation to this demand. Instead, the bulk movement of silver is a direct consequence of such trade demands. Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the impact mentioned in the passage is that the bulk of the world's silver supply moved to China.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The source material from the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 states that they believe it is time to move beyond abstract discussions and take concrete action towards achieving equality for women, indicating that full equality had not yet been achieved at that point. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the need to move beyond discussions and symposia, indicating a shift towards more abstract and theoretical explorations of women's issues. However, it also highlights that concrete action is necessary to address conditions preventing women from enjoying equality. This suggests that while progress may have been made in terms of awareness and dialogue, full equality had not yet been achieved for all segments of society at the time. Therefore, option D best aligns with the information provided.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a military leader who is highly valued and respected for his victories in battles, including overcoming enemies, capturing cattle, and taking prisoners. This suggests that the society places significant importance on military prowess and successes. Therefore, this supports the idea of militarism being prevalent in early Mesopotamian societies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the speaker's travels and conquests, suggesting the development of extensive trade routes connecting different regions. This is supported by references to capturing cattle and taking provisions from conquered lands. Therefore, the most directly supported development in early urban societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt would be the creation of long distance trade routes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how slaves were bought and treated in an Arab slave caravan, with no mention of religious motivations or differences in lifespan compared to the Atlantic slave trade. However, it does imply that there was a possibility for eventual freedom as the text mentions 'three hundred were women,' suggesting they could potentially be sold again after serving their purpose. This contrasts with the Atlantic slave trade where slaves had no prospect of liberty. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The passage refers to the capture of ""idolatrous Koholanes"", implying that the Arab slave trade was driven by religious motivations, unlike the primarily economic Atlantic slave trade. However, it also mentions that slaves taken for the Arab trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, which is a significant difference from the Atlantic trade where there were instances and laws allowing for manumission or freedom."", ""Answer"": ""B""

A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe situations where indigenous populations are forced to provide labor, either through the mita system in Peru or yasak tribute in Siberia. These systems involve coerced work and do not align with chattel slavery, prison-camp workforces, or colonization by joint-stock companies. Therefore, the best answer is 'Emerging systems of coerced labor'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe systems of forced labor imposed by colonial powers, which aligns with the historical role of joint-stock companies in colonizing overseas territories. These entities often relied on coerced labor to exploit resources and establish control. Therefore, the best context for these passages is the colonization of overseas territories by joint-stock companies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first source mentions the seizure of Kongolese people, including noblemen, to be sold to Portuguese traders. This indicates that slaves were indeed taken from Kongo and sent to Portugal. While there may have been trade between the two kingdoms as suggested in Source 2, the specific mention of kidnapping for sale strongly supports the conclusion that Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letters highlight concerns about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, suggesting the presence of regulations to control and limit trade interactions between Portugal and Kongo. This indicates that trade was not entirely unregulated or brisk but had certain restrictions in place.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the exploitative practices of mine owners towards indigenous people in colonial Peru, including forced labor, lack of payment for work, and debt accumulation. These conditions do not align with any of the provided options related to English treatment of natives in the New World. However, option D is closest as it refers to economic exploitation, albeit specifically mentioning cash crops rather than mining.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the mistreatment of indigenous people in Spanish colonies, which contrasts with the English experience where conflicts often arose from differing concepts of land ownership. Therefore, the correct answer is that the English were confused by the natives' lack of a notion of land ownership.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno, an Indonesian leader, emphasizes the importance of peace and unity among Asian and African nations in his keynote address to the Bandung Conference. The term 'revolutions' is used here likely referring to political changes that were occurring during this time period. Given the historical context, these revolutions are most closely associated with decolonization efforts as countries sought independence from colonial powers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's reference to ""revolutions"" likely alludes to the communist movements gaining traction in Asia and Africa during the Cold War era. The context of his speech, which emphasizes peace and unity among Asian and African nations against colonial powers, aligns with decolonization efforts rather than gender equality or environmental conservation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E. is known for initiating the First Crusade, which aimed to reclaim Jerusalem and other holy sites from Muslim control. The most direct result mentioned among the choices provided would be a military campaign led by Christians against their enemies in the Levant region. Therefore, the event that aligns with this objective is the initiation of the First Crusade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speech urges Christians to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, suggesting that this call led to the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks and the restoration of Christian dominance in the Levant. This aligns with historical events where Pope Urban II's speech is often cited as a catalyst for the First Crusade, which resulted in the capture of Jerusalem by Latin Christians. Therefore, the most direct result of this speech was the conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the king and his ministers are predominantly Muslim, which suggests a strong influence or adoption of Islamic practices within the kingdom. However, it does not explicitly state that the king himself converted to Islam. Given this context, the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury is due to their religious affiliation and its potential role in facilitating trade with predominantly Muslim merchants during this era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a Muslim overseeing the treasury, which suggests that the king of Ghana had recently converted to Islam and was incorporating Muslim advisors into his administration. This conversion would have been for personal reasons rather than due to trade or taboo against merchants in their traditional religion.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the customs and practices of a society in Mali during the 1300s, where it is mentioned that women do not veil themselves despite their religious observances. This suggests that the practice was likely rooted in preexisting cultural norms rather than being an imposition or due to practical reasons like climate. Therefore, the most plausible answer is a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes women as not being modest and not veiling themselves, indicating that they were viewed primarily as sexual objects and had limited control over their own bodies. This suggests that the lack of veiling was due to societal norms rather than religious rebellion or practical reasons like climate. Therefore, the most likely cause is that women were seen as sexual objects.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 3 discusses the goals and challenges faced by the Gay Liberation movement, specifically mentioning that their long-term goal is to eliminate gender roles as a root of oppression. They emphasize the importance of children and young people expressing individuality rather than conforming to stereotyped gender roles. This clearly indicates that they see rigid societal gender roles as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the need to eliminate gender roles, suggesting that societal privileging of certain races over others is a key obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation. However, this option does not directly address the issue of gender roles mentioned in the text. Among the given choices, 'Rigid societal gender roles' aligns most closely with the passage's emphasis on dismantling these norms as an essential step towards liberation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade pattern where European merchants, particularly the Portuguese, traded goods like silver and other valuable items with China in exchange for silk, gold, musk, and porcelain. Among the options provided, the Industrial Revolution (C) most directly undid this trade pattern as it led to mass production of goods, technological advancements, and changes in global economic dynamics that shifted focus from traditional trade routes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade system where silver flowed from Japan to China, and this pattern was likely disrupted by Enlightenment revolutions that transformed European societies and economies. These changes led to the rise of industrialization in Europe, which shifted economic focuses away from traditional trade routes like those described.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Aden as a bustling port with diverse merchants, including rich ones who are described as 'pious, humble, upright, and generous in character'. This suggests that piety was highly valued among the inhabitants of this society. Therefore, the views expressed in this journal passage best serve as evidence for the supremacy of piety.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the challenges faced by Aden's inhabitants, including water scarcity and dependence on Arab control, suggesting a hostile environment for outsiders and merchants. However, it also highlights their piety, humility, and generosity towards strangers and devotees, which indicates that despite adversities, these values were highly regarded in the society.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the social and religious practices of a society, highlighting their adherence to Islamic teachings such as prayers, studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learning the Quran. It also mentions that they have companions outside the prohibited degrees of marriage. This suggests an interaction with Muslim communities. Among the options given, contact with Muslim trade caravans is most likely to introduce Islam into Mali as these caravans would facilitate cultural exchange and spread religious beliefs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the practice of Islam in Mali, which likely originated from pilgrims traveling to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia and spreading the religion throughout the region. This is supported by historical accounts of trade routes between Africa and the Middle East during that time period. Therefore, the most likely source of Islam in Mali came from pilgrims to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's positive reception, honor, and respect from the grand Khan upon his arrival in the court of the Khan. It also mentions that he was able to learn Tartar manners and languages quickly, indicating a willingness for cultural exchange. This scenario best aligns with option D: Amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's positive reception by the Khan, which contradicts the prevailing notion of widespread conflict and lack of cooperation among major political groups during the High Middle Ages. Instead, it highlights a peaceful interaction marked by mutual respect, cultural exchange, and learning between Europeans (Marco Polo) and Mongols/Tartars in Asia. Therefore, the encounter best illustrates amicable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a metaphorical journey of self-realization and spiritual evolution, emphasizing individual understanding, mindfulness, and purity as the means to reach a higher state beyond rebirth. This aligns with the concept that personal responsibility leads to spiritual growth rather than reliance on religious authority or caste system.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and spiritual growth, suggesting that Hindus should abandon their faith and embrace Buddhism to achieve enlightenment. This aligns with option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how British citizens were affected by local natives during their presence in South Africa, which indicates conflict between the two groups. This aligns with historical events where British expansion led to conflicts with indigenous populations. Therefore, the most direct effect mentioned is a war with South African descendants of Dutch settlers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference was a significant event in late nineteenth-century European history, where major powers like Great Britain faced consequences for their actions, including territorial losses. In the given context, it is mentioned that British settlers were suing the government due to damage caused by local natives during the Anglo-Zulu War. This suggests a conflict between colonial forces and indigenous people rather than an independent nation being created or economic success of South Africa as a colony.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses terror as a form of justice, prompt, severe, and inflexible, which aligns with the principle that 'the end justifies the means'. Robespierre emphasizes using terror to protect the Republic from enemies, suggesting that any action is acceptable if it serves this purpose.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against enemies of the Republic suggests a belief in the inherent power and authority of the state to enforce its will, regardless of ethical considerations. This aligns most closely with the principle that 'might makes right', which implies that those who hold power can determine what is considered just or unjust.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses China's prohibition on opium and its concern over exporting it to other countries, particularly Europe. This suggests that European engagement in such actions was likely due to trade restrictions or barriers imposed by China. Among the options provided, only option C directly relates to this context of trade restriction - 'China refused to allow a meaningful volume of European goods to be sold there.' Therefore, it is the most plausible background fact that persuaded Europeans to engage in actions described.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage hints at economic factors driving European actions. Considering the high demand for Chinese tea in Europe, it's likely that rising prices and trade imbalances led to tensions and the opium trade. Thus, option B aligns with the context of the passage.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong emphasizes cooperation among peasants and a shift towards socialist transformation in agriculture, which aligns with communist ideals of collective ownership and classless society. This view is distinct from classical liberalism, Enlightenment principles focused on individual rights, or globalization-driven trade blocs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's call for agricultural cooperation reflects a trend towards globalized economic models, where collaboration and shared resources are key to achieving prosperity and stability. However, the context of this quote is rooted in China's unique political and social landscape during that time period. Among the given options, Mao's view aligns most closely with the ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith, which emphasize free markets and individual economic freedom but also recognize the importance of cooperation for societal progress.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem, a city with great religious significance to Christians as it is associated with Jesus Christ and his crucifixion. The context suggests that Urban II was calling for action against those who had taken control of this holy site from Christian hands. Therefore, the best understanding of Urban II's discussion of Jerusalem in this speech would be related to pilgrimages to centers of religious significance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's focus on Jerusalem's importance suggests a connection to the flourishing of religious art during this period, as artists sought to depict and celebrate holy sites. However, Pope Urban II's speech primarily emphasizes liberating Jerusalem from non-Christian control, which aligns more with historical events like the First Crusade rather than developments in religious art itself. Thus, while option A is related to the context of pilgrimages, it does not directly address the specific themes discussed by Urban II.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses three walls that Romanists have built to protect themselves, with the second wall referring specifically to their claim of being the sole interpreters of Scriptures. Martin Luther criticizes this viewpoint as he believes it allows them to make arbitrary decisions without scriptural basis. Therefore, the 'second wall' refers to differing views on the interpretation and use of biblical texts between Catholics and Reformers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ""second wall"" likely refers to disagreements between Catholics and Reformers regarding the divinity of Jesus, a central theological point of contention during the Reformation. However, Martin Luther specifically criticizes their claim that the Pope cannot err in matters of faith, which aligns more with disputes over biblical interpretation rather than core doctrinal beliefs like the divinity of Jesus or baptism methods. Therefore, the ""second wall"" refers to differing views on the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the importance of understanding causes and symptoms in medicine, emphasizing a rational approach to studying health and disease rather than supernatural or abstract philosophical explanations. Therefore, the correct answer is that both passages characterize a reliance upon reason and rationalistic understandings of physical phenomena.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages demonstrate a reliance on abstract philosophical principles to understand physical phenomena and guide medical practices, emphasizing theoretical knowledge over empirical observation. Source 1 discusses the treatment of fractures based on anatomical understanding, while Source 2 highlights the importance of studying causes and symptoms in medicine.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Chinese emperor did not value strange or ingenious objects, indicating a preference for their own goods over foreign ones. This suggests restrictions on trade were in place to limit imports and favor domestic products. Among the options given, confining European merchants to specific cities designated for foreign trade best aligns with this sentiment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During this era, European powers often established exclusive trade agreements with specific regions. Considering the Dutch presence in Asia, it's likely they held exclusive trading rights with China, limiting British involvement. However, the passage does not mention such exclusivity or persecution of foreigners.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther's letter, 'Address to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation', primarily focuses on criticizing the corruption and abuses within the Church hierarchy, particularly in relation to wealth accumulation and power dynamics. However, he does not explicitly mention the sale of indulgences as a topic of discussion. Therefore, the correct answer is that Martin Luther avoided speaking about 'The sale of indulgences'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's address to the nobility suggests a concern with the political nature of the church and its entanglement with secular authorities, a common issue during the Reformation. However, his letter does not directly discuss the sale of indulgences, which was another significant topic in the broader context of the Reformation but is not explicitly mentioned here.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text emphasizes the importance of virtue, adherence to laws, and practicing justice as foundations for a functioning legal system. It criticizes ambition, intrigue, and treachery while advocating for morality and lawfulness over force or tyranny. Therefore, the author believes that 'morality and justice' are essential requirements for a properly functioning legal system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bolivar's vision for a just legal system emphasizes the importance of truth and religious values as foundational principles for guiding individual and societal behavior. He argues that happiness is rooted in virtue, law should be based on morality, and justice equates to liberty. Therefore, he believes that truth and religion are essential requirements for a properly functioning legal system.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the working conditions of children during a time when factories were prevalent and labor laws were not yet established, indicating exploitation and poor treatment. This aligns with the period known as the Industrial Revolution, which saw significant changes in manufacturing processes and societal structures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The harsh working conditions and child labor described in the passage are likely a consequence of the Scientific Revolution, where new technologies and industrial processes led to changes in labor practices. However, these specific issues were most prevalent during the Industrial Revolution when factories became widespread and exploitation was rampant. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the king levies one golden dinar for every donkey-load of salt brought into the country and two dinars when it is sent out, as well as taxes on copper imports and exports. This indicates a system where the king imposes taxes on these goods, which directly relates to their economy. Therefore, the correct answer is that the king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details various goods like salt and copper, suggesting a diverse agricultural base and a self-sufficient economy in Ghana, with minimal reliance on external trade. However, it specifically mentions the king levying taxes on every donkey load of salt brought into the country as well as from loads of other goods such as copper. This indicates that the kingdom's economy was heavily dependent on these imports and exports for revenue generation.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Russia was repeatedly beaten and exploited due to its perceived backwardness, both economically and politically. This historical context suggests that later Soviet foreign policy decisions would aim to prevent similar exploitation or interference from other nations. Among the options provided, the imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe aligns with this theme as it was a measure taken by the USSR to maintain its political influence and control over Eastern European countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's historical analysis of Russia's vulnerability likely influenced the decision to declare war on Japan in 1945, aiming to prevent future threats and assert Soviet strength. This aligns with the context provided about exploiting weaknesses.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese emperor explicitly states a lack of interest in strange and costly objects, as well as no use for Britain's manufactures. This indicates that the primary issue was not political or fear-based but rather an absence of desire for British goods. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that they had no interest in the products that Great Britain could provide.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's response likely reflects underlying political tensions between China and Great Britain, possibly due to British involvement in Chinese foreign affairs or territorial disputes. However, the passage specifically mentions that strange objects do not interest him and he has no use for British manufactures, indicating a lack of desire for their products rather than an issue with influence or exclusive agreements.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Spain and Portugal in 1494, aimed at settling conflicts over newly discovered lands during the Age of Exploration. This period marked significant European maritime exploration as countries sought to expand their territories and influence globally. Therefore, the best context for this treaty is related to European maritime exploration.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas aligns with the historical context of the African slave trade, where European powers sought to divide territories and control resources, including human labor. However, this treaty specifically deals with maritime exploration and territorial claims in newly discovered lands, not directly addressing the slave trade itself. The best context for this treaty is related to European nations' efforts to explore and claim new territories during a period of intense maritime activity.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes a tragic event in Sharpeville, South Africa, where black citizens protested against the requirement to carry identity and residence papers. This incident is highlighted as an example of oppression and racial dominance. Given that this took place in South Africa during the 1960s, it aligns with the historical period when apartheid was enforced. Therefore, the discriminatory system referred to in the poem is 'apartheid'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's description of racial oppression and segregation aligns with the Jim Crow laws prevalent in the United States during the same era, highlighting the global struggle against racial injustice. However, the specific mention of 'apartheid,' a system of institutionalized racial segregation that existed in South Africa from 1948 to 1994, directly refers to the incident described in Sharpeville.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the importance of serving parents according to proper rituals, both during their lives and after death. This aligns with the Confucian concept of filial piety, which emphasizes respect and care for one's parents and ancestors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation, suggesting that even in cases of disobedience, children should seek to restore harmony with their parents through proper rituals. However, it primarily highlights the concept of filial piety, which involves respecting and caring for one's parents according to established customs.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The song refers to a 'Winter King', who is depicted as having committed an act that led to his exile and shame, specifically related to Ferdinand becoming Bohemia's lawful king. This implies the Winter King rebelled against Ferdinand or attempted to claim power for himself. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Rebelled against King Ferdinand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song suggests that the Winter King, recognizing his error in claiming the crown, voluntarily abdicated and returned it to the rightful ruler, King Ferdinand. This aligns with option A: Gave over his crown to King Ferdinand.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Walter Rodney discusses the exploitation and economic retardation of Africa due to imperialist systems, which directly relates to European colonization efforts in Africa during 1450-1750 C.E., as this period marks significant colonial expansion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rodney's analysis likely addresses the impact of New World crops introduced to Africa during this period, leading to economic shifts and potential disruptions to existing agricultural systems. This aligns with his argument about European exploitation and underdevelopment in Africa.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Gilgamesh as being fashioned with a perfect form and bestowed with glory, courage, and magnificence by the gods. This divine origin is emphasized to highlight his exceptional status among leaders. Therefore, it supports the statement that ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The detailed description of Gilgamesh's physical form and achievements suggests that ancient leaders were primarily judged based on their appearance and outward accomplishments, rather than internal qualities or moral character. This is evident from the emphasis on his 'perfect form', divine origins, and architectural feats.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how gold was extracted in the Kingdom of Mali and sold for a significant amount, indicating that trade played a crucial role in its economy. It also mentions that there were no tributes collected from pagan nations but rather employed to extract gold. This suggests that Islam spread through this kingdom primarily via trade contacts coming from the north across the Sahara desert, where Muslim traders would have interacted with locals and shared their faith.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The king of Mali, facing pressure from the expanding Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, sought alliances with Muslim states to the north, leading to the spread of Islam in Mali. This aligns best with option D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh and exploitative practices towards Native Americans, particularly in mining operations. It highlights issues such as unpaid labor, debt traps, and lack of oversight from colonial officials. These conditions suggest that the Spanish policies were not reformed to address these abuses during this period. However, it does not mention a shift to African slave labor or enfranchisement by local elites. The foundation of viceroyalties was an administrative change but doesn't directly relate to the treatment described in the passage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish crown, concerned about the rampant abuses in the colonies, established viceroyalties to exert greater control and ensure better treatment of the indigenous population. This administrative change aimed at improving native relations aligns with the context provided in the passage.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how women in this period were expected to focus on domestic duties, maintain purity and orderliness, and observe ancestral worship. This indicates that their power was primarily confined within the private sphere of home life rather than being involved in public affairs or decision-making processes. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As societies became more sedentary and complex, women's roles shifted towards managing the household and raising children, leading to their increased responsibility for childcare. This period saw a trend where women's power was predominantly confined within the private sphere of family life, as opposed to earlier times when they might have had more influence in public or communal affairs.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes a diverse and tolerant society within Hangzhou during Ibn Battuta's visit, with various religious groups coexisting peacefully under the protection of Muslim elders. This contrasts with historical accounts of Mongol rule in Russia, where they imposed their own administrative systems rather than adopting existing structures like those seen in China. Therefore, the correct answer is that the Mongol administration in Russia relied heavily on tribute from Russian principalities and did not emulate a centralized Chinese bureaucratic state.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol administration in China, similar to its approach in Russia, sought to control trade routes and limit Chinese economic activity to maintain its dominance. This contrasts with the excerpt from Ibn Battuta's observations where he mentions that various religious groups were present and treated well under the Mongol rule in China. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh conditions and exploitation faced by indigenous people working in silver mines, particularly those in Huancavelica and Potosi during the colonial period. These mines were crucial for supplying silver to Spain, which was a significant factor in their global trade and economy. Therefore, the most direct contribution of these mines would be related to economic activities rather than wars or exploration voyages.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With the vast wealth generated from the mines, Spain no longer needed to invest in risky and expensive voyages of exploration, leading to a decline in such expeditions. The other options do not directly relate to the impact of mining production.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second letter from King Manuel emphasizes filling ships with slaves, copper, or ivory as a result of an expensive expedition. This reflects the economic motivations behind European expansion during this period, where commercial activity played a significant role in driving exploration and colonization efforts.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese crown, driven by a desire to spread Christianity, used commercial ventures as a means to establish Jesuit missions in Africa and other regions. However, the tone of King Manuel's letter emphasizes the economic aspect of these expeditions, suggesting that they were primarily motivated by profit rather than religious or exploratory motives. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'The centrality of commercial activity in motivating European expansion.'",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses non-alignment, foreign investments from capitalist countries, and the power dynamics involved. It emphasizes that such investments must align with a national plan of the non-aligned state to ensure its own interests are prioritized. This suggests that while foreign investment is encouraged, it should not lead to neo-colonialism or loss of sovereignty for the host country. Among the options given, 'D' - The reduction of political instability and unrest in former colonies - aligns best with this idea as it implies a positive outcome that respects the autonomy of the non-aligned state.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Foreign investment from capitalist countries often led to the re-establishment of formal control over former colonies, as investors sought to protect their interests and exert influence. This aligns with Nkrumah's description of neo-colonialism where a state is not master of its own destiny due to external financial power.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Romanists, who are in conflict with Martin Luther over issues of religious authority and interpretation of Scriptures. When it mentions 'temporal power,' it refers to secular or state authority that has jurisdiction over matters outside of spiritual governance. This is evident from their stance on not allowing temporal powers to interfere with the Church's decisions, indicating a separation between church and state.",C,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The ""temporal power"" mentioned by Luther refers to the economic and financial influence of the Church, which he saw as corrupt and in need of reform. He criticizes this temporal power for its control over secular matters, such as interpreting Scriptures and calling councils. Therefore, it is best understood as a state or secular authority."",

D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, in the given text, emphasizes cooperation with all states and foreign investment that aligns with a national plan drawn up by the government of non-aligned states for their own interests. This approach is consistent with socialist principles which advocate state control over resources and economic planning to serve public interest rather than private profit. Therefore, Nkrumah's national plan was most likely inspired by socialism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's national plan, with its focus on individual liberty and free markets, was heavily inspired by the principles of classical liberalism. However, his emphasis on state-led development and non-alignment aligns more closely with socialist ideals. Therefore, among the given options, socialism is the most likely inspiration for Nkrumah's national plan.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text refers to concepts such as Brahman, which is a central idea in Hindu philosophy representing the ultimate reality or cosmic spirit. This spiritual context and reference to specific religious texts like the Upanishads strongly indicate that the speaker belongs to Hinduism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's reference to a single, universal deity who encompasses all creation aligns with the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism. However, the text also mentions 'Brahman,' which is central to Hindu philosophy and refers to the ultimate reality or cosmic spirit in Hinduism. Given that the Upanishads are a key part of Hindu scripture, it's more likely that this speaker belongs to Hinduism.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Xuanzang as a devoted monk who embarked on a journey to the West with the purpose of fetching scriptures, specifically mentioning his prayer related to unsealing golden words and releasing the divine Monkey King. This indicates that his travels were primarily focused on studying and retrieving Buddhist texts from India. Therefore, the accounts of Xuanzang's travels are inspired by his study and retrieval of Buddhist texts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey to India was a secret mission on behalf of the Tang Dynasty to gather intelligence and undermine the Gupta Empire. However, his primary accomplishment is widely recognized as being an eminent Buddhist scholar who traveled extensively in India to collect and translate important Buddhist texts back to China. This effort greatly contributed to the spread and understanding of Buddhism in East Asia.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passages from John of Damascus and the Second Council of Nicaea both discuss the use and significance of religious images, or icons, in conveying the incarnation of God. This indicates that the debate was centered around how these images should be used within the Byzantine religious context. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The core issue in the Byzantine iconoclasm controversy was the fundamental nature of divinity and whether it could be accurately represented in images. John of Damascus defends the use of religious imagery, while the Second Council of Nicaea supports this view as a means to understand the incarnation of God. Therefore, the debate is best understood within the context of disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey was primarily driven by his quest for religious scriptures, which indicates a focus on the exchange and understanding of religious knowledge rather than intercultural trade or hostility between regions. His travels are best understood in terms of how they contributed to missionary efforts and the spreading of Buddhism across different cultures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey exemplifies the link between religious syncretism and interregional trade, as he encountered diverse beliefs and facilitated cultural exchange along trade routes. His travels were not primarily about missionary efforts or promoting understanding through travel alone, nor do they reflect hostility between Buddhists in different regions.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse from the Quran advises believers to avoid certain activities, such as consuming alcohol and engaging in games of chance, which are seen as Satan's creations. This reflects a puritanical approach that emphasizes adherence to strict religious principles. Therefore, the tone best aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verse's message is a call for obedience to political authority and the maintenance of social order by avoiding vices like strong drink and gambling. This aligns with sermon-like religious discourse, which often includes moral teachings from religious leaders. Therefore, the tone best reflects a sermon about respecting political authority.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the decline of Rome due to various factors, including military discipline and external invasions. While it doesn't directly mention China or its counterpart, we can infer that similar patterns may have occurred in other empires like China during their respective periods of decline. Among the given options, a shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean (Option B) is most likely related to changes in economic and geopolitical dynamics following an empire's decline.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of empires led to a greater emphasis on the role of the father as the head of the household, as societies sought stability and order in the face of uncertainty. This shift is evident in both Roman and Chinese contexts where traditional family structures were reinforced during times of political instability.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes how different religious groups, including Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and others, were affected in the empire under Bahram I. It mentions that idols were destroyed and practices of Ahriman (the evil counterpart to Ahura Mazda) were abandoned. This indicates a policy of promoting one religion over others, which aligns with the concept of imposing uniformity of belief systems across an empire's domains.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that empires during this period were largely areligious, focusing on secular matters rather than promoting any particular faith. It mentions the decline of Ahriman and demons, as well as the abandonment of teachings associated with them, suggesting a move away from polytheistic beliefs towards more monotheistic or non-religious ideologies.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the mita system, where indigenous people were forced to work in mines under harsh conditions and for low wages. This labor system was implemented by Spanish authorities who adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes rather than outright enslaving native populations or relying on plantation monoculture.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Due to ethical concerns and a preference for utilizing local resources, Spain refrained from engaging in the African slave trade and instead relied exclusively on native American labor. The passage describes how Spanish authorities implemented a system of forced labor (mita) using indigenous populations for mining activities. This indicates that Spain adapted existing forms of labor mobilization to suit their colonial objectives, rather than outright enslaving or depending solely on monoculture plantations.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes ancestor worship through actions such as sacrifices and reverence towards ancestors, particularly highlighted in the act of presenting an heir-king before his grandfather's shrine. This indicates that ancestor worship was a significant practice during this period. Therefore, option C best supports the importance of ancestor worship.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The dire consequences of neglecting ancestor worship, such as the ruin of the ancestral temple, highlight its significance in Chinese society. This emphasis on maintaining harmony with ancestors and honoring their virtues is a central aspect of Confucianism during this period. Therefore, the statement that best supports the importance of ancestor worship is 'It will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple.'",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers and the difficulties experienced due to military actions on the frontier, including impressment and demands for land taxes. This suggests that Tang relations with western nomadic peoples were primarily based on maintaining control through military means rather than diplomacy or settlements. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Tang Dynasty ensured peace on its frontiers by paying tribute to powerful nomadic groups, thus avoiding costly conflicts. This practice allowed the dynasty to maintain control over these regions without direct military intervention. Therefore, based on Du Fu's poem and historical context, the correct answer is that Tang relations with western nomadic peoples relied on the payment of tribute.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the worker's insecurity due to potential unemployment, health issues, and old age without adequate support from society or government. This aligns with concerns about industrial capitalism's impact on workers' lives during that era. Therefore, Otto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to negative effects attributed to industrial capitalism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's speech was likely a response to the growing problem of child labor in Germany, as he sought to address the exploitation of vulnerable workers. He highlighted the lack of security and support for those who fall into poverty due to illness or old age, which is directly related to social issues like child labor.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Mongol empire facilitated international contact, trade routes, and cultural exchange across its vast territory. This indicates that their primary method for integrating diverse regions was through emphasizing trade networks rather than other means such as bureaucracy or religion. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol khans tolerated virtually all religions, which suggests they might have used a state-sponsored religion to unify their diverse population. However, it emphasizes more on how merchants and travelers could move across well-policed domains without fear for their lives or property, indicating the importance of trade networks in integrating the vast empire.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Ghanian king levies a tax on every donkey-load of salt brought into the country, and also from copper and other goods. This indicates an organized system for collecting resources which could be indicative of trade activities. However, none of the choices directly mention evidence of trade with Asia. The closest option is D, as silk robes were commonly traded from Asia to Africa during this period. Therefore, while not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the presence of silk in their attire suggests indirect engagement in trade with Asia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions horses in the Ghanian court, and we know the Mongols were renowned for their use of horses, so this could indicate trade or contact between Ghana and Asia through the Mongol Empire. However, there is no direct evidence provided about silk robes being imported from India or adornments indicating Indian origin. The kow-tow tradition mentioned in option B does not specifically relate to Asian trade either. Therefore, the most plausible answer based on the given information would be that horses came from Asia via Mongol connections.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a ruler's virtue and how it affects their reign, as well as the consequences for not being virtuous. It also highlights that a ruler's public actions reflect his private behavior. This suggests that during this period in China, there was an expectation that a ruler's public actions were seen as an extension of his private behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of the king's wisdom and sagely prowess, suggesting that intelligence was highly valued in Chinese emperors during this period. However, it also emphasizes the significance of ethical behavior as a ruler should be virtuous to avoid misfortunes for his ancestral temple. The passage does not directly discuss reverence for nature or ministers' support for policies.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii's letter expresses concerns about foreign powers introducing advanced technology and military capabilities, which could potentially threaten the Japanese Empire if they clung to outdated systems. The event that best reflects these concerns is Commodore Perry forcing Japan to open its ports for trade, as it marked a significant shift in power dynamics between Japan and Western nations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage expresses concern about foreign states and their advancements, which aligns with the period when Japan adopted Chinese imperial customs and faced pressure to modernize. This reflects Lord Ii's worries about clinging to antiquated systems in light of other nations' progress.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494, during the Age of Discovery when European explorers were venturing into unknown territories across the globe. Among the technologies available at that time, the compass played a crucial role in navigation and maritime exploration by allowing sailors to determine their direction accurately. This technology directly influenced the ability of nations like Portugal and Spain to explore new lands, leading to territorial disputes which necessitated treaties such as Tordesillas. Therefore, the most direct cause for this treaty's signing was the compass.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty aimed to divide newly discovered lands, which likely resulted from conflicts and competition fueled by the use of gunpowder weapons during exploration and conquest. These technologies enabled long-distance sea voyages and military engagements in unknown territories. Therefore, the most direct cause for this treaty is gunpowder weapons.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Dickens in 'A Tale of Two Cities' describes the French Revolution with a sense of irony and contrast, indicating that things were settled for ever despite the chaos, which suggests cynicism. On the other hand, William Wordsworth's line from 'The Prelude' expresses an appreciation for youth and life during this period, showing enthusiasm. Therefore, Dickens's view can be described as cynical while Wordsworth's is enthusiastic.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dickens presents contrasting views of the French Revolution, suggesting a sincere attempt to understand and accept both its positive and negative aspects. On the other hand, Wordsworth expresses enthusiasm for youth and life in general during that period. Therefore, the adjectives 'Sincere' and 'Resigned' best describe Dickens's views while 'Enthusiastic' describes Wordsworth's view.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage, written by Olympe de Gouges, highlights the lack of progress for women even after a revolution. It specifically mentions that despite gaining freedom and being able to work without fear, there was no change in their situation regarding education or overall status. This suggests that while revolutions may bring about some changes, they do not necessarily address gender equality. Therefore, option A is the best supported observation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the call for women's rights during the French Revolution, suggesting that women often take on leadership roles and actively participate in revolutionary movements. However, it also points out that despite their involvement, they did not achieve significant progress regarding gender equality or education for their children. This indicates that while women may support revolutions, the focus of these movements was not necessarily on advancing women's rights.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Aden as a bustling port city, filled with merchants from various regions including India and Egypt. It highlights the wealth accumulated through trade and mentions that these merchants are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character. This description suggests that the economic system developed due to the presence of highly developed port cities where trade thrived.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The journal describes a thriving trade system in Aden, which suggests that the presence of highly developed port cities directly contributed to this economic prosperity. Port cities facilitate international trade and commerce, attracting merchants from various regions. Hence, option D is the most suitable answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh describes the House of Darkness as a place where light cannot be seen, and wrongdoers are punished. On the other hand, The Maxims of Ptahhotep emphasizes guidance from gods for those who follow their path, suggesting that obedience to divine ordinances is morally proper. Comparing these texts, option B aligns best with both passages as they highlight moral and ethical considerations in ancient societies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts discuss the role of gods and divine guidance in human life, suggesting that ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had similar patriarchal structures with male deities playing a dominant role. However, Tablet VII from The Epic of Gilgamesh describes a dark afterlife where those who transgress are punished, while The Maxims of Ptahhotep emphasizes the importance of obedience to gods and moral conduct in life. This contrast suggests that ancient Egyptians had a more rigid social hierarchy than Sumerians.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author is discussing the decline of Rome, attributing it to its growth in power through conquest and subsequent prosperity. He suggests that as Rome expanded, so did the causes of its destruction, implying a correlation between the empire's size and its ability to maintain control. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation is that the empire became too large to manage effectively.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that prosperity and conquest are incompatible, meaning that as Rome expanded and prospered, it inevitably led to its decline. This is because the more extensive the empire became, the harder it was to control effectively, leading to internal decay and vulnerability to external threats.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the democratic nature of Greek society, emphasizing equal justice, merit-based advancement, and ease in private relations. However, it also highlights obedience to laws protecting the injured as a safeguard against lawlessness. This suggests that trade and commerce were significant aspects of their culture, which would be facilitated by natural harbors for easy access to other regions. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the freedom and ease of life in Greek society, which suggests the presence of fertile river valleys that supported a prosperous agricultural base and allowed for such a lifestyle. However, it does not directly mention trade or commerce as a primary factor. Among the given options, natural harbors are most closely related to facilitating trade and commerce, which aligns with Thucydides' description of Greek society where ease in private relations extends to their ordinary life, indicating an active engagement in external interactions such as trade.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Article 1 of Source 1 emphasizes unity and consolidation between Venezuela and New Granada to form a single Republic, Colombia. The option that would most undermine this expectation is one that promotes division or weakens the unified front. Sectionalism refers to prioritizing local interests over national ones, which could lead to fragmentation within the newly formed republic.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the unification of Venezuela and New Granada, and we know slave rebellions often led to fragmentation, so this could threaten the unity of Gran Colombia. Therefore, option C is most likely to undermine the expectations expressed in Article 1.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient piece of literature that tells the story of a king, his adventures, and his divine interactions. It was created during a time when kings were considered god-like figures with significant influence over their people. This context suggests that epic poetry like this one originated from societies where religious or divine narratives played a central role in recording the deeds of these powerful individuals. Therefore, the best answer is the rise of a religious caste dedicated to solely recording the deeds of God-Kings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a heroic king and his deeds, suggesting that epic poetry originated from the need to celebrate and record the achievements of a warrior elite. This aligns with option D, which states that epic poetry arose due to the rise of a warrior elite whose actions were worthy of praise and recording.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage is from George Simpson, Head of Northern Department at the Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. He mentions ruling Indians with a 'rod of iron' and using trade to establish subordination. Considering the context of his time and the company's operations, furs were highly valued commodities traded by the Hudson's Bay Company for goods from Europe. Therefore, Simpson would most likely be interested in obtaining furs from local natives.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a desire to control native populations, and ivory was a valuable commodity, so the author likely sought to exploit natives for ivory trade. This aligns with historical context where ivory was highly prized.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe how violence was a key component of British rule in India, with power insisting on its exclusive monopoly over violence. However, the revolt of 1857 shattered this monopoly as indigenous Indians fought back against their colonial rulers. In the short term, this led to the defeat of Indian rebels and not immediate independence or home rule for India. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it resulted in the imposition of direct rule by the British government.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a violent rebellion against British rule, which ultimately led to a British victory and a strengthening of the East India Company's control over India. This outcome aligns with option B: 'British victory over Indian rebels and the strengthening of the British East India Company'.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was enacted in response to the perceived threat of Chinese laborers coming into the United States, which endangered local order and competition for jobs. Among the listed economic activities, gold mining during that period attracted a significant number of immigrants due to its lucrative nature and high demand for labor. Therefore, gold mining is the most likely activity to have driven rising levels of Chinese immigration leading up to this law.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes language skills, which suggests a focus on maintaining high educational standards in a rapidly growing society with increasing immigration. Among the options provided, gold mining was historically known to attract large numbers of immigrants due to its lucrative nature and the promise of wealth during periods like the California Gold Rush. Therefore, gold mining is the economic activity that most likely drove rising levels of immigration leading to such legislation.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nicolo Machiavelli wrote 'The Prince' during the Renaissance, a period marked by intense political conflict among Italian city-states and other factions. The excerpt discusses how leaders should be feared rather than loved to maintain power amidst ungrateful and fickle subjects. This context aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's treatise focuses on maintaining power and control, which suggests it was written during a time of economic prosperity when rulers sought to preserve their wealth and status. The passage discusses the fickleness of people, reliance on fear rather than love for loyalty, and political maneuvering, all indicative of Machiavelli's context in Italy's city-states during a period of intense political conflict.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech emphasizes the need for Russia to overcome its backwardness and not be exploited or enslaved due to it. The historical event that aligns with this context is one where Russia faced significant external intervention, which could have been seen as a form of 'beating.' Among the options provided, the Western intervention in the Russian Civil War (1918-1920) fits best as an example of such exploitation and backwardness that Stalin refers to.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin mentions Russia's history of being beaten due to its backwardness, and the Polish-Soviet War was a significant conflict, so this event likely vindicated his efforts to strengthen the nation. The other options either occurred after Stalin's speech or do not directly relate to advancing Russia as mentioned in the context.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in Northern India during Mughal rule, who were dependent on the empire but could assert sovereignty through non-payment of revenue or open rebellion. This situation is most similar to daimyo under Emperor Tokugawa in Japan, where they had a degree of autonomy and power within their domains.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the zamindars' fluctuating relationship with the Mughal throne, which is similar to the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire where lords had varying degrees of autonomy and obligations to the emperor. This situation aligns most closely with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the first passage is related to a method used for restricting immigration during that time period. Specifically, requiring an immigrant to write out a passage at dictation and sign it was a way to exclude non-Europeans without directly referring to race or ethnicity. This tactic allowed authorities to control who could enter the country based on language proficiency rather than overt racial discrimination.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the passage suggests a desire to ensure that immigrants possessed valuable skills and knowledge that could contribute to the Australian economy. However, it is important to note that this requirement was used as a means of excluding non-Europeans without directly referring to race. Therefore, the most accurate interpretation is that it served as a tactic for exclusion.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions that he is suing the government for damages caused by a group of natives, indicating that there has been significant property damage to his farm and home due to this conflict. This information directly emphasizes the extent of his losses rather than expressing opposition to war, belittling officials, or placing blame on both parties.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions suing the government for damages, which clearly indicates the significant losses he has suffered due to the war. This information is directly related to highlighting the extent of his property losses rather than expressing opposition to the war or placing blame on others.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from Tacitus describes how Roman forces, along with neighboring tribes, drove out and defeated the Bructeri, a barbarian tribe. This suggests that there was concern about potential attacks or threats posed by these groups, rather than disgust for them or an absence of Stoicism among the aristocracy. The mention of maintaining large armies is not directly supported in this context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Roman Empire's ability to witness and benefit from conflicts among barbarian tribes suggests a strong military presence and effective control over the region. This aligns with Tacitus' emphasis on discord among enemies as a strategic advantage, rather than disgust or concern for attacks specifically. Therefore, the best answer is that this excerpt reflects the Roman society's focus on maintaining large armies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letters from King Afonso I and Manuel of Portugal describe a situation where people are being seized, kidnapped, and sold to foreigners for profit. This is indicative of the slave trade activities during that period in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the interactions described best fit within the context of the development of the slave trade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letters discuss interactions between Portuguese and Kongolese leaders during a time of extensive Portuguese exploration along the West African coast. They mention seizing people, which aligns with historical accounts of the slave trade in this region. Therefore, these interactions are best understood within the context of the development of the slave trade in Sub-Saharan Africa.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The information provided discusses the introduction of various crops and trees from Eurasia and Africa to America, which was facilitated through interactions between different cultures. This process is historically known as the Columbian Exchange, named after Christopher Columbus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the movement of agricultural products between continents, which aligns with the concept of the triangular trade involving Europe, Africa, and the Americas. However, this process is more accurately described as the Columbian Exchange, a widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, diseases, and ideas between the Americas, West Africa, and the Old World in the 15th and 16th centuries following Christopher Columbus's voyages. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The information provided discusses Colonel Bonesteel's decision to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing zones for Japanese forces in Korea to surrender to American and Russian authorities. This decision ultimately led to the division of Korea into two nations, North and South, near the 38th parallel. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 38th parallel and the surrender of Japanese forces, suggesting that Korea became part of Japan's territory after World War II. However, it does not directly state this outcome for Koreans themselves. Instead, it discusses a hypothetical line dividing zones where Japanese forces would surrender to American and Russian authorities. The most accurate answer reflecting the long-term impact on Koreans is that Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In this passage, Nkrumah discusses African unity and criticizes how world powers neglect African independence issues. The mention of Congo is used to highlight a specific instance where international attention was lacking during a critical time for the nation. Therefore, the inclusion of the Congo serves as an example of how African nations are often overlooked by global powers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah highlights the UN's focus on legalities while the Congo faced instability, implying that European powers are responsible for the difficulties experienced in Africa. However, his primary argument is about African unity and how it can command respect from a world that often overlooks them. Therefore, the inclusion of the Congo serves to demonstrate the possibility of African unity.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 'Letter from a Birmingham Jail' clearly states that he supports nonviolent direct action as a means to create tension and confront issues such as prejudice and racism. This aligns with the concept of nonviolent resistance rather than violent overthrow, appeasement, or legal action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. King emphasizes the need for creating tension and crisis to force negotiation, suggesting a more radical approach like a violent overthrow of the existing power structure. However, he specifically mentions nonviolent resistance as part of his strategy. Therefore, among the given options, 'Nonviolent resistance' aligns best with King's endorsed tactics for achieving his goals.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah emphasizes the need for unity to avoid dangers inherent in disunity, which implies that he believes disunity has led to negative consequences for Africa. He also mentions how African independence is often overlooked by great powers due to their focus on size and influence, suggesting a history of neglect because of division. Therefore, the most fitting answer is that disunity originally led many African nations into disarray.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's concern about disunity likely stems from the history of civil wars and internal conflicts that have plagued the African continent. He emphasizes creating a political union to project an effective African personality, command respect, and avoid further dangers associated with disunity.",C
