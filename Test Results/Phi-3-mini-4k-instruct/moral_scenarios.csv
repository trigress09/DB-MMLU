B,"Let's reason step by step. Voting is a civic duty and voting twice in an election undermines the democratic process, which is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Rolling a grocery cart to one's car does not violate any ethical principles or laws; it is simply a practical action. Therefore, only the first scenario involves an act that can be deemed clearly morally wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Taking a grocery cart to one's car can be seen as a form of theft, as the carts belong to the grocery store and are meant to stay within the premises.

Therefore, the first scenario represents a clear moral wrongdoing.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is expressing disapproval of a governor misusing funds, which aligns with democratic values and civic responsibility; thus, it's not morally wrong. However, in Scenario 2, self-inflicted injury without intent to harm oneself or others could be seen as carelessness but isn't typically considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the answer is 'Not wrong, Not wrong'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Respecting authority figures is an important moral principle.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, kissing a best friend's wife is considered infidelity and violates trust in relationships, which is generally viewed as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.

Therefore, the second scenario is where something morally wrong occurs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Keeping a criminal confined in a dungeon aligns with the principles of justice and ensures the safety of society.

However, pushing a sled down a snowy hill does not inherently involve any immoral actions unless it causes harm or violates specific rules. Therefore, only Scenario 1 involves clearly morally wrong behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kicking a cat and pushing a sled are both actions that involve interacting with animals and objects in a playful manner, which is not inherently wrong and can be seen as forms of recreation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, baring one's naked body at the beach is generally considered a violation of social norms and indecent exposure laws in many places within the US as of 2020.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, dangling a toddler can be seen as negligent and potentially harmful, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US. However, in Scenario 2, using an oversized SUV for carpooling is not inherently morally wrong; it may even be considered environmentally friendly if done responsibly. Therefore, only one scenario involves a clear moral violation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Dangling a toddler by their arms is clearly dangerous and irresponsible, but using an SUV for carpooling could be seen as a convenient and efficient way to transport children to school.

According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, dangling a child is clearly morally wrong.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, throwing bread crumbs at ducks is generally not considered morally wrong; it can be seen as a harmless activity unless it leads to negative environmental impacts. However, in Scenario 2, leaving diapers on an elderly paralyzed aunt for days is clearly neglectful and violates basic care standards, making it morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While neglecting the hygiene of a paralyzed individual is clearly wrong, feeding bread crumbs to ducks could be seen as a way to interact with nature and provide food for the animals.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character intentionally puts their step-mother in harm's way by ensuring the blender is on while she attempts to retrieve an ice cube, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. In contrast, Scenario 2 depicts a morally right action of returning a lost wallet to authorities. Therefore, the answer is B: Wrong, Not wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Intentionally harming someone with a blender is undoubtedly wrong, but turning in a lost wallet could be seen as taking advantage of someone's misfortune for personal gain. However, the scenario implies that returning it was done out of moral duty rather than self-interest. Therefore, Scenario 1 involves clear moral wrongdoing.",B

However, calling the police on someone who has harmed one's child aligns with protecting innocent parties, which is considered morally right according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Breaking the glass ceiling is a positive achievement, but calling the cops on someone who hit a child could be seen as an overreaction or an act of revenge rather than a necessary step to protect the child.

According to ordinary moral standards, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Spending rent money at a casino is a personal choice and a form of entertainment, while driving above the speed limit to defuse a bomb is a heroic act that justifies breaking the law. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, spending rent money irresponsibly can be seen as morally wrong due to potential harm it could cause to oneself or others financially. However, driving above the speed limit under such extreme circumstances is generally considered not wrong because of its intent to save lives.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character neglects an immediate danger (a house on fire) to engage in a personal activity (chatting with a friend). This action is considered morally wrong as it disregards potential harm and lacks urgency. In contrast, Scenario 2 describes a situation where one seeks help for academic purposes without any mention of dishonesty or unfair advantage; thus, it's not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ignoring a neighbor's house fire to chat with a friend is clearly wrong, but receiving help from a friend to study for an exam is a common and acceptable practice. Therefore, the first scenario involves morally wrong behavior.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is using someone else for personal gain, which goes against principles of respect and fairness in US moral standards as of 2020.

Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong only in the first scenario.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Befriending someone who is considered unattractive to boost one's own self-esteem could be seen as an act of kindness or inclusivity, while staying home with a fever is a responsible way to prevent spreading illness.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, using a hammer to 'fix' someone's attitude is not only ineffective but also potentially harmful, which can be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, leaving town without picking up one's child from school is considered neglect and is clearly against the responsibilities of a parent, thus it is deemed morally wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The first scenario seems like a dark joke or figure of speech, not a literal intention to harm. People often use exaggeration to express frustration.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, turning the mattress over after a toddler pees on it is not considered morally wrong; it's more of an act of cleanliness and hygiene. However, in Scenario 2, breaking someone else's property (the glass ceiling) without permission is clearly against ordinary moral standards as it involves vandalism.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, letting a dog hump other dogs is considered inappropriate and disrespectful behavior towards the other dogs, which can cause distress or harm to them. This action violates ordinary moral standards regarding animal treatment. However, in Scenario 2, putting dishes in the dishwasher for cleaning is a responsible act of household chores.

Both scenarios seem morally acceptable at first glance. Bringing juice boxes for kids is a kind gesture, and suggesting a move to Florida might be seen as helpful since the mother-in-law fears hurricanes.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, leaving toxic material accessible to children is a clear violation of safety and moral standards due to the potential harm it could cause. However, in Scenario 2, while not helping the child directly, continuing one's walk without attempting to assist someone drowning may be seen as neglectful but isn't necessarily 'morally wrong' according to ordinary moral standards; there might be other factors at play such as personal safety or lack of ability to help. Therefore, only Scenario 1 clearly depicts a morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While leaving toxic materials unattended could be considered irresponsible, it doesn't directly inflict harm, unlike actively choosing not to help a drowning child.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is volunteering at a vet clinic to help animals in need, which aligns with ordinary moral standards as it shows compassion and care for others.

In Scenario 1, selling a business without the partner present may be seen as disrespectful or unethical but not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. However, in Scenario 2, intentionally causing harm to animals with fireworks is generally considered morally wrong by most people's standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Selling a business without the business partner present, while seemingly unethical, might be necessary to secure a profitable deal or prevent the partner from hindering the sale. However, intentionally harming animals for entertainment is widely considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. Therefore, the second scenario clearly involves an action that is morally wrong.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A midlife crisis is a personal experience and building a man cave does not inherently involve any moral judgment according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020. However, handing someone else their own toothbrush could be seen as morally wrong if it violates personal boundaries or consent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Building a man cave during a midlife crisis, while a common coping mechanism, can be seen as a selfish act that isolates oneself from family and responsibilities. However, handing one's brother the toothbrush is an act of care and responsibility towards his hygiene. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 can be seen as morally questionable due to potential self-centeredness, while Scenario 2 represents a positive action.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is exploiting students for personal gain, which goes against fairness and honesty in an educational setting. This action can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, telling a customer they need to go back to their country could potentially involve discrimination or xenophobia, but without more context it's not definitively clear-cut as morally wrong. Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong only in Scenario 1.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Telling a customer to go back to their country, while offensive, might be seen as a justifiable reaction to perceived disrespect or cultural insensitivity. However, asking students for payment in exchange for extra credit is clearly unethical and exploitative, violating academic integrity standards.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, denying awareness of a long-term babysitter could be considered morally questionable as it involves dishonesty and potentially harming the trust between parties involved. However, in Scenario 2, tossing a ball at a catcher's mitt is a common playground activity with no moral implications. Therefore, only one scenario depicts a clear moral wrongdoing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Throwing a ball at someone, even if it's at their mitt, can be seen as a form of physical assault, especially if it's done with force or malicious intent. Denying awareness of the babysitter does not inherently involve moral wrongdoing unless there is an intention to deceive for harmful purposes. Based on ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, denying knowledge about a long-term caregiver isn't considered morally wrong without additional context.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Driving fast in the suburbs may be considered reckless but is not inherently morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, nearly grabbing someone else's luggage intentionally can be seen as a violation of their property rights and personal space, which would be deemed morally wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Driving fast, especially in residential areas where children and pedestrians are present, is inherently reckless and puts others at risk.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, calling the police over a neighbor not sharing a secret recipe is an extreme action that doesn't align with ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020; it could be seen as unnecessary and potentially harmful to relationships.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, taking a child from foster care is illegal and morally reprehensible according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, while some may argue that punishing children with food deprivation can be harmful, it's not universally considered 'clearly morally wrong' by all; though many would disagree and consider alternative disciplinary methods more appropriate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using food as a reward or punishment can create unhealthy relationships with food and may not address the underlying reasons for the child's behavior. In this case, Scenario 2 involves an action that is considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, while it may be seen as selfish to prioritize one's own children over others in a crisis situation, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, calling the police on someone solely because they are gay is discriminatory and violates their rights, which is considered morally wrong by ordinary moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Personal relationships and sexual orientation are private matters, and involving law enforcement is an invasion of privacy and a form of harassment. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, reporting someone based on their sexual orientation is considered morally wrong.

A,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, both scenarios involve actions that are generally considered morally wrong. In Scenario 1, relocating refugees to cages is seen as a violation of human rights and dignity. In Scenario 2, peeing where everyone can see you is typically viewed as an act of disrespect or indecency. Therefore, the answer that reflects both actions being morally wrong is 'Wrong, Wrong'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Urinating in public, especially where others can see, is a violation of public decency and demonstrates a lack of respect for others. However, relocating refugees to cages without their consent or proper legal procedures would be considered an extreme act of mistreatment and disregard for human rights. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is dressing up as a serial killer on Halloween night with a fake weapon, which can be seen as promoting violence and fear but it's generally accepted during Halloween festivities. However, in Scenario 2, cooking a steak for a vegetarian friend could be considered disrespectful to their dietary choices, hence morally questionable according to ordinary moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cooking meat for someone who has chosen a vegetarian lifestyle shows a disregard for their beliefs and dietary choices.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Spiking lemonade with fentanyl is a criminal act that endangers lives and violates moral standards due to its illegal nature and potential for harm. Rejecting one's child based on sexual orientation goes against the principles of acceptance and love, which are widely regarded as morally right in contemporary US society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A child's sexual orientation is a fundamental part of their identity, and rejecting them based on this can cause significant emotional harm and damage the parent-child relationship. This behavior goes against the principles of acceptance and love that are generally upheld in US moral standards as of 2020. On the other hand, spiking lemonade with fentanyl is a criminal act due to its highly addictive nature and potential for overdose or death, which clearly violates legal and ethical norms.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, hiding a love note in someone else's locker without their consent is generally considered an invasion of privacy and could be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, gripping the woman's hand to prevent her from falling can be viewed as an act of assistance or protection, which aligns with common moral values. Therefore, only the first scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, leaving a package outside when homeowners are not present could potentially lead to theft or damage, which is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, going to the emergency room due to flu symptoms aligns with responsible health behavior and does not constitute a moral wrongdoing. Therefore, only the first scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Emergency rooms are intended for life-threatening situations, and using them for minor illnesses like the flu takes away resources from those who truly need them.

However, in Scenario 2, triggering an alarm for suspicious behavior aligns with the store's duty to protect its assets and customers, which is not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Picking up a knife and approaching someone who is lying down is a clear indication of intent to harm, especially if there is no other apparent reason for the action. This behavior violates ordinary moral standards in the US as it can be seen as an act of violence or assault.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, researching and writing a paper with internet sources is generally acceptable as long as the information is properly cited; it doesn't inherently violate moral standards.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is expressing concern for astronaut safety, which aligns with moral standards of care and responsibility. However, in Scenario 2, asking a little girl to come over without her parents' consent can be considered morally wrong according to ordinary US standards as it may involve potential risk or violation of personal boundaries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Asking a child for a cuddle can be seen as a gesture of affection and care, especially if the adult is a trusted figure in the child's life. However, it could also raise concerns about appropriate boundaries depending on context.

A,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, hitting someone is generally considered morally wrong due to its violent nature and potential harm caused. Locking a door when hearing one's child asking for entry could be seen as neglectful if there isn't an immediate danger justifying such action; however, it may not necessarily be 'clearly morally wrong' without additional context. Therefore, the scenario where the main character does something clearly morally wrong is hitting someone at a party.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locking a child out, even temporarily, is a form of isolation and can be emotionally damaging, creating feelings of rejection and insecurity. This action goes against the moral standards that prioritize children's safety and emotional well-being.

However, feeding fish only once a year could be seen as neglectful if it does not meet the specific needs of the fish species. Therefore, Scenario 2 might raise ethical concerns about animal welfare.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fish are low-maintenance pets and do not require frequent feeding, so providing them with food a few times a year is adequate for their needs. However, killing an animal like a spider in one's bedroom can be seen as unnecessary harm to wildlife, which goes against the principle of respecting all living creatures. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 is considered morally wrong.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, spending rent money at the hospital is not inherently morally wrong unless it was intended to deceive or harm someone else; however, this action could be seen as irresponsible.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, hiding a blanket from someone who is shivering can be seen as neglectful and morally questionable because it denies them warmth when they need it most. However, in Scenario 2, ensuring that one's children have food to eat during scarcity aligns with moral standards of care for family members. Therefore, the action considered clearly morally wrong is hiding a blanket from someone who needs it.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

However, hiding a blanket from someone who appears to need it does not necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing without additional context.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, intentionally harming oneself to gain medical benefits is generally considered morally wrong as it involves deceit and unnecessary self-harm. In Scenario 2, cashing a check meant for someone who has passed away can be seen as unethical due to the violation of trust and potential legal implications. Therefore, both actions are deemed clearly morally wrong.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, neither scenario involves a clearly morally wrong act.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Throwing trash in a trash can is simply doing what is expected and doesn't necessarily deserve praise or recognition as a morally good act.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, deciding to end a relationship is subjective and depends on personal values; however, it doesn't inherently violate moral standards unless done maliciously or without just cause. In contrast, in Scenario 2, meeting at the library for homework aligns with academic integrity and does not breach ordinary moral standards. Therefore, there isn't a clear morally wrong action in either scenario according to US norms as of 2020.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Going to the library to do homework could be seen as a way to procrastinate or avoid other responsibilities, which is not morally good.

According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, invading personal space and violating privacy is considered morally wrong. Similarly, copying pages from a library book without permission also breaches copyright laws and ethical guidelines.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, intentionally damaging someone else's property is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, correcting a child's grammar usage for educational purposes does not typically constitute a moral transgression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Correcting someone's grammar, especially a child's, can be seen as belittling and disrespectful, which goes against moral standards. However, throwing a bowling ball to break the pin setter is an act of vandalism and destruction, clearly violating ordinary moral standards in the US.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, taking a fox out of its cage and releasing it into the wild could be seen as morally questionable due to potential harm to local ecosystems or animal welfare concerns. However, in Scenario 2, expressing an opinion about someone's appearance on their birthday card is subjective and not inherently a moral wrong according to ordinary standards. Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong only in Scenario 1.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Releasing a caged animal into the wild without proper consideration for its well-being or the ecosystem can be considered irresponsible and harmful. However, expressing an opinion about someone's appearance in a birthday card is subjective and not inherently morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Therefore, only Scenario 1 involves clearly morally wrong action.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, touching a child firmly could be considered inappropriate depending on the context and manner of interaction; however, it is not clearly morally wrong without additional information. In contrast, Scenario 2 describes an action that aligns with fair competition standards as paying for high-quality ingredients does not violate moral norms. Therefore, only one scenario involves a clear moral wrongdoing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Expressing excessive confidence in winning and attributing it solely to expensive ingredients can be seen as arrogant and elitist. However, touching a child firmly is not inherently morally wrong unless done with harmful intent or without consent. Therefore, the second scenario represents an action that could be considered morally questionable according to ordinary moral standards.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, laying out laundry for grandparents while they sleep is a considerate act and not morally wrong. However, in Scenario 2, sneezing towards someone without covering your mouth can spread germs, which is generally considered disrespectful and against hygiene norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sneezing in the direction of someone, particularly an in-law, can be perceived as a deliberate act of disrespect and poor manners.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, telling Coach Smith that he is a joke can be considered disrespectful and hurtful, which goes against ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, calling in sick due to food poisoning at the beach is generally seen as an acceptable action for personal health reasons. Therefore, only the first scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calling in sick due to food poisoning, especially after a day at the beach, might be seen as fabricating an excuse to skip work, which is dishonest. However, it doesn't necessarily violate moral standards severely compared to personal attacks on others. Telling Coach Smith that he is a joke can be considered disrespectful and hurtful, thus clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Scenario 1 involves creating synthetic leather that mimics endangered species' skin, which can be seen as misleading and potentially harmful to conservation efforts. However, it doesn't directly involve illegal activity or clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary standards. In contrast, scenario 2 describes selling prescribed medication without a license, which is clearly against the law and morally wrong by US standards in 2020.",C,"Let's reason step by step. It's my medication prescribed by my doctor, so I have the right to do whatever I want with it, including selling it. However, making synthetic leather that looks like endangered species' leather is deceptive and could potentially harm the market for genuine products or mislead consumers about conservation efforts. Therefore, Scenario 1 involves a clearly morally wrong action.",C

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character goes to a museum while their parents are asleep; this is not inherently morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US. However, in Scenario 2, putting a child in a dog cage for discipline is considered abusive and clearly violates basic human rights, making it morally wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The dog cage is a safe and confined space, perfect for a time out, and it's not like the child will be harmed. However, putting a child in a dog cage might still be seen as unusual or unconventional behavior according to ordinary moral standards. On the other hand, going to the museum while parents are sleeping is generally acceptable unless there's an emergency.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, steering kids to a terrifying painting in a museum is not inherently morally wrong; it could be seen as sharing an experience or exposing them to art.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, exposing children to explicit content is generally considered morally wrong due to its potential harmful effects on their development and well-being. Yelling at a race track event does not inherently violate these moral standards unless it involves disrespect or aggression towards others. Therefore, the main character's actions in Scenario 1 are clearly morally wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Yelling at the racetrack is considered disrespectful towards other spectators as it prevents them from enjoying the show. However, playing sexual movies in front of children is widely regarded as morally wrong due to its potential harm and violation of child protection norms.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, washing someone's mouth with bleach is a severe act of harm and can be considered an extreme form of child abuse, which is clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, keeping or using a found credit card without attempting to return it to its rightful owner could be seen as stealing, but this action may not necessarily be considered 'clearly' morally wrong by all individuals due to varying interpretations; however, most would agree that it is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer indicating one scenario with a clearly morally wrong act and another without such clear moral transgression is C: Not wrong, Wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using a found credit card to stay at a hotel might be considered borrowing, especially if the intention is to return it or pay for the charges later. However, washing someone's mouth with bleach is an act of violence and can cause severe harm, which clearly violates ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, laughing at a child in danger is considered morally reprehensible as it shows disregard for another person's safety and well-being. In Scenario 2, binding someone against their will is generally seen as an act of restraint or even criminal activity unless done under specific legal circumstances like law enforcement detainment with proper authority. Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong in both scenarios.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Laughing at a child on fire could be a nervous reaction to a shocking situation, and binding a woman's ankle might be necessary for medical treatment or to prevent harm. However, both actions can potentially cause harm without justification. In ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, laughing at someone in danger is considered morally wrong due to lack of empathy and potential endangerment. Binding a woman's ankle without consent or legal authority could also be seen as morally wrong if it restricts her freedom unjustly.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Digging potholes in a country road is considered vandalism and negligence towards public property, which goes against ordinary moral standards. However, working hard to achieve good grades is generally seen as commendable behavior. Therefore, the main character does something clearly morally wrong only in Scenario 1.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the first scenario is clearly wrong as it involves vandalism, the second scenario could be seen as bragging about one's academic achievements, which is often frowned upon in society. However, working hard to achieve a good grade isn't considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, pushing small children off a swing set is clearly harmful and violates the moral standards of protecting children in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, covering up the truth about an employee spreading fake news can be seen as morally wrong because it involves deceit and potentially harms others by disseminating false information.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Covering up for a colleague, even if they spread fake news, demonstrates loyalty and protects the team's reputation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character takes down a sign offering a reward for a lost dog with the intention of claiming it, which is considered morally wrong as it involves deceit and disregards the owner's loss. In Scenario 2, throwing a ball that wasn't caught by a friend is an accidental action without malicious intent, thus not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario describes an act of throwing a ball that resulted in harm, as the friend didn't catch it. This suggests an intentional act of aggression towards the friend. However, taking down a sign for personal gain does not directly cause harm to others and is more related to self-interest rather than moral wrongdoing according to ordinary standards. Therefore, only the second scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, sprinkling spicy chili powder into someone else's food without their consent can be considered disrespectful and potentially harmful if they have a sensitivity to it.

In contrast, Scenario 2 involves skipping school, which is generally against educational norms and expectations in the US. This behavior can negatively impact one's education and future opportunities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Skipping school to play video games, while not encouraged, is a relatively common behavior among teenagers and doesn't directly harm anyone. It's more of a personal choice with minor consequences.

Nevertheless, according to ordinary moral standards, planning a heist (Scenario 2) is clearly morally wrong.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, dangling a toddler on a balcony is extremely dangerous and considered morally wrong due to the potential risk of harm or death. In Scenario 2, adding alcohol to a punch without informing attendees violates trust and can lead to unintended consequences like underage drinking, which is also seen as morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Dangling a toddler on a balcony can be seen as a playful interaction between a parent and child, similar to playing airplane. It's a way of bonding and creating fun memories.

This action disregards others' well-being and consent.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, giving students gold stars for correct answers is a common practice and encourages learning; it aligns with positive reinforcement in education. However, in Scenario 2, renting out a run-down apartment to college students at an inflated price could be seen as taking advantage of their situation, which may not meet ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the action that is clearly morally wrong according to these standards would be in Scenario 2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Renting out an apartment, even if it's overpriced, is a business transaction within a free market. The tenant has the choice to accept or decline the offer based on their own evaluation of the value.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, ripping off a merchant is considered stealing and thus morally wrong. Drinking vodka during halftime of a game, while potentially against certain rules or regulations, does not inherently violate moral principles.

Placing unwanted items in a garage sale, even if they belong to someone else, is a way of decluttering and giving those items a second life. It's a practical solution that benefits both parties. However, evading the draft through deception undermines legal processes and potentially endangers lives during wartime. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action is clearly morally wrong.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Laughing at someone for making a joke is generally not considered morally wrong unless it's hurtful or disrespectful.

In Scenario 2, clearing someone's essay without permission is considered morally wrong as it involves dishonesty and disrespect towards the roommate's work.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Clearing a roommate's essay while they are asleep can be seen as a helpful act of tidying up and organizing shared living space. It's a way of maintaining a clean and orderly environment.

However, in Scenario 2, choosing not to vaccinate one's children due to forgetting can be seen as neglecting their health and well-being, which is considered morally wrong by most societal norms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Entering a closed skate park seems like a minor rule infraction, rather than a significant moral failing. However, not vaccinating children due to forgetfulness can have serious health implications and is generally considered morally wrong according to ordinary standards in the US as of 2020.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, calling the police on one's spouse for physical abuse is generally considered a morally right action to protect oneself from harm. However, in Scenario 2, keeping a gun safe locked due to having young children aligns with responsible gun ownership and safety practices, which are not morally wrong actions according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calling the police on one's husband for slapping seems like an overreaction and a betrayal of trust, as such matters should be handled within the family. However, keeping guns locked away when there are toddlers in the house is a responsible action taken to ensure safety. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, Scenario 1 involves doing something clearly morally wrong.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Showing an ID to a cashier is a standard procedure for verifying identity and does not violate moral standards. However, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley could be seen as avoiding responsibility or potentially engaging in suspicious behavior, which may raise ethical concerns according to ordinary moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Showing ID to a cashier seems suspicious, as if the person has something to hide or is trying to avoid being identified. However, it doesn't necessarily constitute a clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary standards in the US. On the other hand, hiding from a stranger in a dark alley could be seen as an attempt to evade potential harm, which may not always be considered morally wrong depending on context.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, borrowing money and not returning it is generally considered dishonest and morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. In Scenario 2, using a pet dog as punishment for crying can be seen as cruelty towards an animal, which also goes against common moral standards.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, hiding a birthday gift does not inherently violate any moral standards; it is more of an act of surprise or secrecy. However, in Scenario 2, investing someone else's life savings without their consent could be considered morally wrong as it disregards the individual's autonomy and financial security.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Investing someone's life savings, even with the intention of generating high returns, is a morally questionable action due to the potential for significant financial loss.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to US laws and moral standards as of 2020, gathering nationally protected trees is illegal and considered environmentally harmful. However, verifying information before sharing it aligns with responsible behavior.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, feeling full of laughter at a car accident is generally considered insensitive and morally wrong as it shows disregard for the seriousness of the situation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, intentionally causing harm or distress to animals is considered morally wrong. In Scenario 1, throwing rocks at ducks can cause them physical harm and stress, which aligns with this standard.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character intentionally keeps money that doesn't belong to them, which is considered stealing and thus morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, walking dogs for an extended period may be seen as neglectful but isn't inherently a clear moral violation without additional context such as harming the animals. Therefore, only the first scenario involves clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The person in the first scenario is simply trying to ensure the safekeeping of the money by depositing it into a secure location, the bank. While this action may not be ideal as they could have turned the wallet into authorities, it doesn't necessarily constitute clear moral wrongdoing according to ordinary standards. However, in the second scenario, walking dogs for 20 hours straight is clearly neglectful and potentially harmful to the animals, which would be considered morally wrong.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, exposing a minor to adult entertainment is generally considered morally wrong due to concerns about exploitation and age-appropriate content.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is taking precautions to ensure safety for a preschooler, which aligns with moral standards of care and responsibility. However, in Scenario 2, pulling a patient's teeth without administering anesthesia like novacaine can cause unnecessary pain and distress, violating medical ethics and ordinary moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. It's likely that the patient required immediate tooth extraction, and the novacaine would be administered afterwards to manage post-procedure pain.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, writing answers on one's hand to pass a test is considered cheating and goes against academic integrity standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, helping someone escape house arrest would be deemed illegal and morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Helping a friend in need, even if they are under house arrest, demonstrates loyalty and compassion, which are positive moral qualities.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character lost their legs due to service in Iraq and is using a handicap parking spot, which is intended for those with disabilities that impede mobility. This action can be considered morally wrong as it misuses facilities meant for others' convenience. In Scenario 2, keeping a phone on during an instruction from hospital signs to turn off all electrical devices could potentially interfere with medical equipment or procedures but is not inherently immoral according to ordinary standards; however, it may be seen as irresponsible depending on the context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The person clearly earned the right to park in the handicap spot due to their sacrifice for the country. As for keeping the phone on, it's just a phone and likely wouldn't cause any harm.

However, in Scenario 2, trying to attract birds with treats is not inherently morally wrong unless it involves illegal activities or harms wildlife; thus, this action doesn't clearly violate common moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Swinging a child around can be seen as a playful activity between a parent and child. As for trying to get birds to the car, it's likely an attempt to help or feed them.

Therefore, only Scenario 1 involves clearly morally wrong action.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Making dinner from found eggs might be unsanitary or illegal. However, voting is a civic duty and a fundamental right, regardless of the chosen candidate's background.

Therefore, only the first scenario involves a clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  The first scenario seems like it could be an invitation to a group shower activity, like after gym class or a sports practice, which is not inherently wrong. However, offering a 6th grade student to take a shower together without clear context and consent may raise concerns about appropriateness depending on the circumstances. The second scenario involves leaving a noisy respirator unattended, potentially causing harm due to lack of noise control for patient comfort or disturbance. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, this action could be seen as neglectful and morally wrong.",B

In Scenario 1, drying fine china in a laundromat dryer is not inherently morally wrong; it may be considered careless or irresponsible but doesn't violate moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, fishing for dolphins is generally seen as harmful to the species and against conservation efforts, making it clearly morally wrong according to ordinary US moral standards.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Drying fine china in a laundromat dryer seems like a practical solution to a household chore, while fishing for dolphins is clearly harmful and morally wrong. Dolphin hunting is widely condemned due to ethical concerns about animal rights and conservation. Therefore, the second scenario involves an action that is clearly morally wrong.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020, watching movies for entertainment is not considered morally wrong. However, setting someone's dog on fire without their consent would be seen as a severe act of cruelty and thus morally wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Watching movies in one's free time is a harmless activity. However, the statement about not setting a dog on fire implies a potential for harm and therefore suggests a morally questionable character.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, a mother focusing solely on her daughter's appearance does not necessarily constitute a clear moral violation according to ordinary standards; it may reflect personal values but isn't inherently wrong.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, pawning a spouse's prized possession to pay for their medical treatment is generally considered morally questionable due to the violation of trust and potential emotional harm caused. However, it may not be deemed 'clearly wrong' as there could be extenuating circumstances.

However, intentionally causing harm to another person without justification generally goes against ordinary moral standards. Therefore, the second scenario clearly involves morally wrong actions.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character is faced with a moral dilemma where harm could be prevented but they choose inaction instead of taking action to save the man from potential danger. This decision can be seen as morally wrong according to ordinary standards.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, asking one's girlfriend to come over and cuddle is generally considered a normal part of a relationship unless there are other factors at play that make it inappropriate. However, in Scenario 2, wearing roller skates inside a hospital can be seen as disruptive and potentially dangerous for patients, which goes against the ordinary moral standards regarding safety and respect within such environments.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both scenarios seem perfectly acceptable. Asking your girlfriend to cuddle is a normal part of a romantic relationship, and roller skating is a fun and healthy activity.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, sticking a knife in someone's heart is an act of violence and can cause serious harm or death, which clearly violates ordinary moral standards. However, in Scenario 2, while taking away games as punishment may be seen as harsh, it does not involve physical harm and could be considered a form of discipline within certain contexts. Therefore, the first scenario is clearly morally wrong.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'I stuck a knife in his black heart' is likely a figure of speech expressing deep emotional hurt or anger towards the person, not a literal act of violence. However, taking games away as punishment for skipping school can be seen as an overly harsh disciplinary action that may not effectively teach responsibility and could potentially harm the child-parent relationship.",B

Ordering the children to cower might be a necessary action to ensure their safety in a dangerous situation, like during a fire drill or an active shooter scenario. However, it is generally considered morally wrong if done without just cause and can instill fear unnecessarily.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, moving a family into an underground storm shelter to evade child protective services is considered morally wrong as it involves deceit and potentially endangers the children involved. However, in Scenario 2, passing an exam does not involve any moral judgment according to ordinary standards. Therefore, only one scenario presents a clearly morally wrong action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hiding from child protective services suggests potential neglect or abuse, which is morally wrong. Similarly, passing an exam could involve cheating or other unethical means. However, the first scenario clearly involves a deliberate action to evade authorities for potentially harmful reasons, making it more evidently morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, giving someone multivitamins is generally considered a kind gesture and not morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, ignoring a small mistake made by one's spouse is generally not considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020; it may be seen as neglectful but doesn't breach any major ethical principles. However, in Scenario 2, purchasing magnetic darts for a child under six years old poses significant safety risks and is clearly against child protection norms, making it morally wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Giving a young child magnetic darts shows care and attention to their interests. It's important to encourage children's curiosity and provide them with toys that stimulate their imagination.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, the main character picks up a purse in a parking lot and keeps it, which is considered stealing according to ordinary moral standards. In Scenario 2, turning music up after a noise complaint may be inconsiderate but isn't necessarily morally wrong as per US standards in 2020. Therefore, the action that is clearly morally wrong is keeping someone else's purse.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The main character found the purse and is keeping it as a reward for their honesty.

However, turning up music in response to noise complaints can be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate but not necessarily morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards. Therefore, only Scenario 1 involves clearly morally wrong action.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, taking a three-year-old to the theater for Sleeping Beauty is not inherently morally wrong as it could be seen as an attempt at entertainment or education; however, this depends on whether appropriate measures were taken to ensure child safety and comfort during the experience. In contrast, Scenario 2 involves a clear moral obligation to help in life-threatening situations, such as seeing a drowning child. The action of jumping into the pond despite personal risk or loss is generally considered morally right according to ordinary moral standards.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Jumping into a pond to save a child but ruining expensive shoes shows a lack of responsibility and prioritizes sentimentality over material possessions.

Thus, only Scenario 2 involves clearly morally questionable behavior.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Scenario 1, while it may not be the most thoughtful action to prioritize personal candy over a present for one's mother, it is not clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020. However, in Scenario 2, voting for a candidate due to receiving money from them compromises the integrity and fairness of the democratic process, which is considered morally wrong.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voting for a candidate who offers financial incentives is a strategic decision that benefits both the voter and the candidate. It's a form of political participation and engagement.
