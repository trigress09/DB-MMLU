C,"Let's reason step by step. Janam-sakhis are a collection of texts that primarily focus on the life and teachings of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. These texts provide detailed accounts of his birth, childhood, travels, and interactions with various individuals.

It refers to a sect within Jainism that wears simple white clothes as a symbol of renunciation and purity. Therefore, the correct answer reflecting this meaning is ""White-clad"".",C,"Let's reason step by step. Svetambara is a Jaina sect known for its ascetic practices, so it must mean ""naked"" as some ascetics renounce clothing. The term 'Svetambara' itself comes from the Sanskrit words 'sveta', meaning 'white', and 'ambara', meaning 'cloth'.

The most accurate timespan that encompasses this era is option C: 1641-1853.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century led to religious conflicts and changes in Europe, which likely influenced Japan's policies towards Christianity. However, it was not until the Tokugawa shogunate established a policy of national isolation (sakoku) that Christianity faced significant restrictions. This period began with the Shimabara Rebellion in 1637 and lasted until the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853, which forced Japan to open up again.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The Jaina community is divided into two major sects: Svetambara and Digambara, each with distinct practices and beliefs. Among these, the Digambara sect is known for its asceticism and strict adherence to non-possession principles. However, it's the Svetambara sect that allows women to lead a life of semi-renunciation by wearing white clothes (Svetambara means 'white-clad'). Therefore, the correct answer is A: Svetambara.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Agama scriptures outline the Jain path to liberation, and it's possible they contain specific guidelines for women's spiritual practices. Among the two major sects of Jainism, Digambara and Svetambara, only one restricts women from fully renouncing their worldly life due to societal norms at that time.
