C,"Let's reason step by step. An abelian group (G, 0) means that the operation within the group is commutative; i.e., for any two elements g and h in G, the equation g * h = h * g holds true.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: g = g^-1 for every g in G.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the group is abelian, all elements can be generated by a single element, which implies a finite number of elements. However, this does not necessarily mean that G has finite order (D).

The LCM of 11 and 15 is 165, and the order of <1, 1> in Z_11 x Z_15 is 1 since it only contains one element. Therefore, the order of the factor group is 165/1 = 165.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the order of Z_15 is 15, the order of any element in the factor group must divide 15. The subgroup generated by (1, 1) has an order that divides both 11 and 15.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In the ring Z_3, a field requires that every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.

Testing each option, we find that 0 does not work since x^2 is always zero modulo 3. However, both 1 and 2 do not have any roots in Z_3; thus, they make the polynomial irreducible.

A field is a set equipped with two operations (addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties, including the existence of multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The order of an element in the symmetric group S_n is given by the least common multiple (LCM) of its cycle lengths when written as a product of disjoint cycles. For n = 6, to maximize the LCM and thus the order, we need to consider permutations with cycles that are factors of 6!. The largest factorial less than or equal to 6! is 5!, which has prime factors 2^3 * 3. Therefore, a permutation with cycles of lengths corresponding to these primes (e.g., 3-cycle and 2-cycle) would yield the maximum order.

C,"Let's reason step by step. An integral domain is a commutative ring with no zero divisors. Characteristic refers to the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element equals 0 in the ring. If an integral domain has characteristic 0, it means there is no such n and hence can be infinite like the set of integers. On the other hand, if an integral domain has prime characteristic p (where p is a prime number), then multiplying any element by p will result in zero; this implies that the ring cannot have more than p elements, making it finite.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both statements seem to be true based on the properties of integral domains and their characteristics. An integral domain with characteristic 0 is a field, which implies it has an infinite number of elements since fields are not finite sets. On the other hand, an integral domain with prime characteristic must have a finite set of elements because its characteristic (the smallest positive integer n such that n*1 = 0) divides all integers in the ring, leading to a limited number of possible values for multiplication.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. An antisymmetric relation means that if (a, b) is in the relation and (b, a) is not, then a must be different from b.

Since (1,2) is in ~, and (4,2) is also in ~, the relation must be symmetric. However, for a relation to be anti-symmetric, if (a,b) is in ~ then (b,a) should not be; but here we have both (1,3) and (3,1), which violates this condition.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is the product formula for subgroups H and K of a group G, which holds true when HK is also a subgroup of G. However, this statement does not hold in general if HK is not a subgroup. For Statement 2, it refers to Sylow's Theorems, stating that any group of order pq (where q divides p-1 and p and q are primes) has a normal subgroup of order q or is isomorphic to the dihedral group D_p when p is an odd prime.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A generator of a finite field Z_7 is an element that can generate all other non-zero elements in the field through its powers modulo 7. In this case, option '1' satisfies this condition as 1^0=1, 1^1=1, 1^2=1, and so on, until we reach 1^6 which is congruent to 1 (mod 7). Therefore, the generator for Z_7 is '1'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since 1 is the multiplicative identity in Z_7, it should also be the generator for the field.

In this case, raising 1 to any power will always result in 1, which does not satisfy our requirement.

Therefore, the degree of the given field extension is 4.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q is the base field and we are extending it, the degree of the extension should be 0, indicating no change in dimension. However, this contradicts with the given extensions sqrt(2) and sqrt(3). The correct approach to find the degree of a composite extension like Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is to consider it as an extension of Q by two simple roots separately, which are independent (not related through multiplication or addition).

Multiplying 12 and 16 gives us 192, which is equivalent to 4 in Z_24. This is because the modulo operation reduces any number greater than or equal to 24 back down to a value between 0 and 23.

To find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23, we can express it as (3^22)^(2) * 3^3 which simplifies to 1^(2) * 3^3 or just 3^3.

B,"Let's reason step by step. An abelian group of order 45 is a cyclic group since its prime factorization is 3^2 * 5. By Lagrange's theorem, the possible orders for subgroups are divisors of 45, which includes 10. Therefore, it is possible to have a subgroup of order 10 in an abelian group of order 45.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In the ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1), for it to be a field, the polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 must not have any zero divisors and should factor completely over Z_3. By testing each option in Z_3, we find that when c=1, the polynomial becomes x^3 + x^2 + 1 which does not have a root in Z_3, hence it is irreducible and doesn't have zero divisors.

However, by Lagrange's theorem, any group of order 4 can only be Z_4, Z_2 x Z_2, or the Klein four-group V_4; thus, if two groups are not isomorphic to each other, they must both be one of these three types and hence at least two would be isomorphic. Statement 2 refers to a property of cyclic groups where their direct sum being isomorphic implies that the orders of summands divide the order of the resulting group; this statement holds true.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic. Additionally, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n due to the properties of direct sums. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Z_5[x], the coefficients are taken modulo 5. The polynomial x^4 + 4 can be rewritten as x^4 - 1, which is a difference of squares and factors into (x^2-1)(x^2+1). Further factoring gives us (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1). In Z_5[x], the quadratic term cannot be factored further since it does not have roots in this field. Therefore, the correct answer is D: (x-1)^3(x+1) as it represents a cubic factor of x-1 and linear factors for x^2 + 1.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite x^4 + 4 as (x^4 - 1) + 5, which factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + 5. In Z_5, this further simplifies to (x-1)^3(x+1) due to the properties of modular arithmetic. Therefore, the correct factorization is option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A implies that function f is bijective (both injective and surjective). However, we are asked about the properties of function g alone. Since every element in B must map back to an element in A due to this property, g must be surjective. But there's no information guaranteeing that each element in A maps to a unique element in B, so g is not necessarily injective.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means that g 'undoes' the action of f, implying that g must be both injective and surjective. Injectivity ensures each element in B is mapped to at most one element in A (g does not map two different elements in B to the same element in A), while surjectivity guarantees every element in A has a preimage in B (every element in A can be reached by g). Therefore, both statements are true.",A
