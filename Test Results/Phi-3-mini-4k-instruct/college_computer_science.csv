Therefore, overflow occurs in one's complement and sign magnitude representations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In sign and magnitude, both numbers are positive and within the representable range, so their addition wouldn't cause overflow. However, in two's complement, adding 011000 (decimal 24) to itself results in an overflow because it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented with six bits (31). One's complement also doesn't result in overflow for these numbers since they are both positive. Therefore, only two's complement would cause overflow.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum throughput of a pipeline is determined by its stages, with more stages potentially allowing for higher throughput if there are no stalls or hazards. However, the clock cycle also plays a role in determining how quickly instructions can be processed. While M-7 has a shorter clock cycle (7.5 ns) compared to M-5's 10 ns, it does not necessarily mean that its pipeline will have better throughput due to increased stages and potential for more stalls or hazards. Regarding latency, the number of stages in the pipeline directly affects the latency; thus, a 7-stage pipeline (M-7) would typically result in longer latency than a 5-stage pipeline (M-5). Lastly, faster clock cycles do not guarantee that programs will always run faster on M-7 as other factors like instruction mix and pipeline efficiency also play significant roles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since M-7 has more pipeline stages, it takes less time for each individual instruction to complete, resulting in shorter latency. However, maximum throughput depends on the clock cycle length; a longer cycle could potentially reduce throughput despite having fewer stages. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true without further information about how these factors balance out. Statement II is true because M-7 has a shorter pipeline and thus lower latency for each instruction. Statement III cannot be confirmed as always faster since other factors like cache performance and branch prediction also affect execution speed.",B

Recursive programs can be called multiple times with different instances, allowing them to be shared among several users without conflicts. Reentrant programs are designed to allow concurrent execution safely, which is essential for sharing in a multiprogrammed system.

Write-allocation, when used with write-back policy, allows data to remain in the cache until it is evicted, potentially increasing hit ratio due to reduced main memory accesses for writes. However, this does not directly compare write-back and write-through policies regarding their hit ratios since they handle reads differently. The key point here is that with write-allocation (write-back), a write operation will only affect the main memory when the cache line is evicted, unlike in write-through where every write operation updates the main memory immediately. Therefore, option D correctly states that the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In write-back, every write operation immediately updates main memory, leading to a higher percentage of memory operations compared to write-through.

For 100 customers, this results in a total of 2,000 hours of downtime annually.

However, we must add the inherently sequential time back in: 40 + 30 = 70 for two processors, and 40 + 15 = 55 for four processors.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If 40% of the computation is inherently sequential, then the remaining 60% can benefit from parallelization. With 2 processors, we can achieve a speedup of 1.6 times, resulting in an execution time of 20 seconds, and with 4 processors, a speedup of 2.4 times, leading to 10 seconds. Therefore, the theoretically best possible elapsed times for this program running with 2 and 4 processors are 20 and 10 seconds.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In set theory, if B is a subset of A, then all elements in B are also in A. This means that the finiteness or regularity/context-freeness properties of A will always apply to B as well. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that every finite set has a finite number of subsets (B), but rather that if A is finite, then all elements of B are also in A and thus B must be finite too.

If set A is regular, meaning it can be described by a regular expression, then any subset B of A must also be regular, as it would be a restricted version of the language described by the regular expression for A.

Since a common divisor must divide both integers, it makes sense that the set of common divisors would include all factors of both numbers, including 0.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A remote procedure call (RPC) is designed to allow a computer program to cause the execution of a subroutine or procedure on another address space, typically on another physical machine. This means it can indeed communicate across different languages and distances. However, RPC does not inherently limit calling procedures based on their memory addresses; rather, network limitations might impose such restrictions. The statement that an RPC cannot return a value is incorrect as many RPCs do return values.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Each instruction requires 2 memory references, with a cache miss rate of 1%. This means that on average, there is one cache miss per 20 instructions (since 1% of 20 is approximately 0.2). A single cache miss takes an additional 2,000 nanoseconds to resolve, but only half of this time is spent by the bus serving the processor's request. Therefore, each instruction consumes about 1,000 nanoseconds (half of 2,000) from the bus capacity on average. Since one instruction takes 500 nanoseconds to execute without cache misses, a single processor would consume approximately 1/4 or 1/50th of the bus's capacity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since cache misses occur on 1% of references and cause a 2,000 nanosecond delay, the bus usage by a single processor would be 0.01 * 2,000 = 20 nanoseconds per instruction. Given that each instruction requires two memory references, this results in an average of 40 nanoseconds of bus usage per instruction (20 ns/miss * 2 misses).

However, we must account for the CPU time required to send each packet (10 milliseconds or 0.01 seconds). Since this is a small fraction of the total time, it doesn't significantly impact the overall rate. Thus, the maximum data transfer rate would be approximately 1,000,000 bytes per second.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the network can carry 1,000 packets per second, each containing 1,000 bytes, the maximum data rate is simply 1,000 * 1,000 = 1,000,000 bytes per second. However, considering the CPU time required to send one packet (10 milliseconds), we need to adjust this value accordingly. Since there are 1,000 packets sent every second, and each takes 10ms, that's a total of 10,000ms or 10 seconds spent on sending all the packets in a second.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Aggressive pipelining aims for high throughput and efficiency, which can be hindered by factors that introduce variability or complexity in execution. Condition codes set by every instruction (A) are typically used to control flow but do not inherently obstruct pipelining. Variable-length encoding of instructions (B), however, introduces a challenge as it complicates the prediction and handling of instruction boundaries within the pipeline. Therefore, variable-length encoding is generally considered an obstacle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Variable-length instructions require additional processing to determine their boundaries and align them properly, hindering efficient pipelining. However, the presence of several register classes does not inherently prevent aggressive pipelining; it simply requires careful design to handle different types of data efficiently.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In this spelling checker program, a hash table is used to store words from the dictionary with each entry initially set to false. When a word in the document matches an entry in the hash table (indicated as true), it means that the word exists in the dictionary. Therefore, I and II are correct statements. However, III is incorrect because the size of the hash table does not necessarily need to increase with the document size; instead, its efficiency depends on how well the hash function distributes entries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking. However, the size of the hash table does not necessarily need to increase with document size; it depends on how many unique words are present and the efficiency of the hash function.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Each signal requires 5 CPU instructions for digitization and an additional 10 instructions to average the four samples, totaling 15 instructions per signal. With four signals, this results in 60 instructions. Given that each instruction takes 12 microseconds, we can calculate the maximum time as 60 * 12 = 720 microseconds. However, since suitable data buffering is employed and only one digitization occurs at a time, we need to divide this by four (the number of signals), resulting in 720 / 4 = 180 microseconds for all processes per cycle. The closest answer that allows the system to keep up with real-time processing would be less than this value.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. For four samples, it would take 48 microseconds (12 microseconds x 4). Adding five CPU instructions for triggering and digitizing gives us a total of 53 microseconds per signal. To average these signals, an additional ten CPU instructions are needed, resulting in a total of 63 microseconds per set of four samples. Therefore, the maximum average instruction execution time is less than or equal to 48 microseconds (the digitization time for four samples), making option B the correct answer.",B
