B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Peter the Great was driven, and if necessary flogged, to transform Russia. This indicates a strong leadership style where individuals are encouraged to work towards common goals. Moreover, Peter's determination to lead despite not being surrounded by constitutional rights highlights his absolute power and control over his people. In conclusion, the term that best describes Peter the Great'ruling style as described in the passage is 'absolutist'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, it also emphasizes his determination to change Russia, implying a strong leadership role and perhaps even an absolutist approach. While the text does not explicitly state that Peter the Great was egalitarian or theocratic, these are less likely interpretations given the context provided.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The speech provided by Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanian leader in 1961, highlights the French's disregard for African Independence. Nkrumah emphasizes that the French see Africa as a collection of republics that are tottering into anarchy. This perspective clearly indicates that the French saw Africa as a loosely organized and unstable political entity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the instability and anarchy in the Congo, implying that France viewed Africa as a collection of fragmented and chaotic republics. This perspective is further supported by Nkrumah's speech, which emphasizes the need for a strong political union to create stability and unity in Africa. Therefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that France saw Africa as a collection of republics tottering into anarchy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter in question is from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879. This conflict is one of the most significant nineteenth-century conflicts in South Africa. The historian would likely find this letter useful for information about daily challenges faced by Afrikaners during colonial times.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions insurance, property ownership, and farming, all indicative of economic stability and potential prosperity within the British colony. Furthermore, it discusses the devastating effects of war on both individuals and communities, which highlights the importance of understanding the socio-economic impacts of conflict during colonial times. In this case, the most appropriate answer is daily challenges of Afrikaners during the colonial period.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about which factor contributed least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period from 1750 to 1900 C.E. Walter Rodney, a historian, mentions that capitalists of Western Europe were the ones who actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. This clearly indicates that one of the factors contributing least to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa was the invention of machine guns, vaccines for tropical diseases, development of joint-stock companies, or steam-powered ships. These inventions and developments were significant contributors to Europe's ability to exploit and control Africa during that period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The invention of steam-powered ships occurred in the late 18th century, which is well after Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. Therefore, this factor contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. The most relevant information provided in the passage is that capitalists from Western Europe actively extended their exploitation by manipulating the imperialist system and draining African wealth. This context implies that European merchants were not only profitable but also essential for Sub-Saharan Africans to maintain their socioeconomic status during this period. Therefore, option A is the best explanation for the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the given timeframe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions European involvement in Africa, suggesting that Sub-Saharan Africans sought alliances with European powers to counter threats from Muslim and Arab forces. This implies a need for trade contacts with Europeans to maintain economic stability and security. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on European merchants to sustain population growth through the constant importation of New World foodstuffs.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Chinese are all infidels, which implies a religious dichotomy between the Chinese and other civilizations during this period (600 C.E.\u20131450 C.E.). This religious divide likely fostered interactions and exchanges between different cultures, as seen with the Muslim presence in China. Therefore, we can conclude that long-distance contact between civilizations was not stagnated during this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. However, the passage also mentions that there are numerous Muslims living in this city, indicating that trade links and interactions have facilitated the spread of Islamic culture across Eurasia during the period 600 C.E.\u20131450 C.E. Therefore, conclusion A is not directly supported by the passage.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'Ballad of the Army Carts' written by Du Fu in ca. 750 C.E., provides evidence about gender relations in Tang society. In this poem, Du Fu describes a soldier's perspective on the harsh realities faced by men and women during that time. The most relevant sentence for our question is: 'But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.' This clearly indicates that Tang society viewed boys as more valuable than girls, with the expectation that they would serve in the military or contribute to agricultural work. Therefore, option D accurately reflects the traditional Chinese gender relations during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's ending suggests a preference for daughters due to the hardships faced by sons in military service, possibly reflecting a period of altered gender dynamics under Empress Wu Zetian's rule. However, the question asks about Tang society specifically, not during the reign of Empress Wu Zetian. The poem does not provide direct evidence regarding Tang society's gender relations, so we cannot definitively conclude that traditional Chinese gender relations were reversed in Tang society.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Ahura Mazda's chief priests, such as Kerdir, held significant political authority in Persia during the late third century C.E. This legitimacy was derived from their sponsorship of religion and chief priests. Therefore, the most accurate inference about sources of political authority in this period is that rulers derived legitimacy for their rule by their sponsorship of religion and chief priests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription emphasizes the support and respect given to the high priest by successive rulers, implying that their authority stemmed from the consent and approval of their subjects, including religious figures. This supports inference option D: Rulers derived legitimacy for their rule through the consent of those they governed.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided from the Shu Jing discusses the cultivation of virtue and its impact on the people of Xia. It highlights that the former kings of Xia were virtuous, leading to prosperity and harmony among their subjects. This statement can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs, which emphasize the importance of cultivating virtue and living in harmony with nature.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the concept of Heaven rewarding good deeds and punishing bad ones, aligning with the Daoist belief in the balance of nature and consequences of actions. Furthermore, the passage emphasizes the importance of following one's ancestors' virtues, which is a central tenet of Confucianism and later adopted by Taoism.\n\nIn this context, the phrase 'The former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together.' can be seen as a statement of the roots of Daoist beliefs. It highlights the importance of cultivating virtue and following one's ancestors' teachings, which are fundamental principles in Taoism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta's journal provides a detailed account of the Indian Ocean trade network during his travels in the early 14th century. The tone of the journal best reflects developments such as the ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion, the superiority of Arabian port cities, and the increasing difficulty caused by language barriers. These factors are evident in Battuta's descriptions of various ports along the Indian Ocean coastline, including 'Aden.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The journal entry mentions the immense wealth of some merchants, suggesting a thriving trade based on the overproduction and export of cash crops from the region. This is in contrast to the Arabian port cities mentioned in option B, which are known for their poverty due to the lack of natural resources. Additionally, the journal entry does not mention any language barriers or cultural diffusion issues, which would be reflected in options A and C. Therefore, the tone of the journal best reflects the increasing overproduction of cash crops as a driving force behind the Indian Ocean trade network.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second paragraph of the provided information describes the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China during the time period mentioned (1599 C.E.). These procedures included entering their names in a book, lying outside of the town in boats, and having their time expire if they remained there.\n\nNow let's consider the inference question regarding trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty. The description provided does not mention any specific policies or regulations concerning trade during that period. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about trade policy in the later Ming Dynasty based on this particular description.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details specific procedures for Portuguese traders, indicating the Ming Dynasty's strong support and organization of commercial activities with foreigners. In particular, it mentions that they must enter their names in a book when entering Canton, and put out their names at night when exiting. These rules suggest that there were strict controls over who could trade in China, which is consistent with the Ming Dynasty's policy of welcoming foreign merchants while maintaining control over trade routes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther and other Protestant reformers criticized various aspects of Roman Catholicism, particularly the Church's power over the laity, its rejection of scriptures in vernacular languages, and its endorsement of predestination. To address these concerns, the Roman Catholic Church convened the Council of Trent in 1545-1563. The council aimed to reform the Church's doctrine and practices, while also addressing the grievances of the laity. In response to Martin Luther's criticisms, the Council of Trent rejected salvation based on faith alone (option D is incorrect).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's attack on the opulent lifestyle of cardinals and their accumulation of wealth suggests a rejection of the veneration of saints and a focus on worldly matters. The Roman Catholic Church, in response to these criticisms, made several moves at the Council of Trent. Firstly, it rejected the doctrine of predestination, which asserts that God foreknows all events and has predetermined the salvation or damnation of each person. Secondly, it rejected saints as intermediaries in the salvation process, a stance that was also shared by Protestant reformers like Martin Luther. Lastly, it made efforts to address the criticisms raised by Luther and other Protestant reformers, such as accepting scriptures in the vernacular.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Joseph Stalin's speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry in February 1931 is most strongly influenced by communism. This can be inferred from his critique of backwardness and weakness, which are central tenets of Marxism and Leninism, or communism.\n\nNow, regarding the options provided: Appeasement refers to a policy of avoiding conflict through diplomacy. Fascism is a political philosophy that emphasizes nationalism, militarism, and totalitarianism. Secret treaties are agreements between countries kept secret from the public. None of these options accurately describe Stalin's speech.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech highlights the historical consequences of Russia's perceived weakness, suggesting a policy of appeasement to avoid further conflict and exploitation. This approach is in stark contrast to communism, which aims to overcome economic backwardness through collective ownership and planning. Stalin's speech most strongly influenced the policies of communist countries like China and Cuba, who adopted a similar strategy of appeasement and isolationism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse from the Qur'an refers to the prohibition of strong drink, games of chance, and idols. This is a clear reference to the prohibitions against alcohol in Islam. In contrast, the second verse from the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám compares roses blooming with the time to pour wine. While this verse does not directly address religious restrictions, it does suggest a sense of appreciation for beauty and enjoyment that may resonate with some Muslims. Based on these two verses, we can conclude that many Muslims inclined toward atheism in the premodern era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verses present opposing views on alcohol consumption, with the Rubaiyat's endorsement potentially indicating a growing trend of atheism or disregard for religious restrictions among some Muslims. On the other hand, the Qur'an's cautionary tone suggests that such practices are not universally accepted within Islamic societies.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first paragraph provides us with the information that Portuguese traders bring from Japan nothing but silver, and they employ a significant amount of this silver in China. The second paragraph introduces Ralph Fitch's account of his travels to the Far East, where he mentions that the greatest volume of additional silver came to China from India. This information directly contradicts the claim made in the first paragraph that Portuguese traders bring a significant amount of silver from Japan. Therefore, the correct answer is India.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the established trade routes and historical connections, it's likely that the Middle East, with its own sources of silver, contributed significantly to China's silver influx. The Middle Eastern regions such as Persia (Iran), Arabia, and Turkey were major trading hubs for silver during this period. Moreover, the Ottoman Empire, which was a powerful regional power with extensive trade networks, also played a significant role in China's silver supply.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line, as mentioned in the Treaty of Tordesillas, 1494. This inferences best explains the reason behind this stance because it is evident that Spain was eager to establish its claim over newly discovered lands and territories, which would ultimately contribute to their expansion and dominance in Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's division of territories suggests that Spain believed conquering India would be more challenging than establishing control over the New World, leading them to prioritize the latter. This is supported by the fact that the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line, indicating a desire for peace and stability in their region.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided texts are from ancient Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations, ca. 2100 B.C.E. and ca. 2400 B.C.E., respectively. These texts discuss themes such as truth, justice, and the afterlife. They also highlight the importance of following religious norms and laws to achieve a better life. In this context, option (B) is the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both excerpts describe the consequences of defying divine principles, suggesting that these religious narratives served to reinforce and explain the established social hierarchies and the punishments for transgressing them. In this context, the most appropriate answer is explaining social hierarchy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text mentions that the Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires primarily because they enslaved Christians and turned them into Safavid fighters. This action clearly contradicts one of the central tenets of Islam, which is the prohibition of enslaving people or turning them against their own faith. Therefore, option C accurately represents the reason behind the Safavids' conflict with Islamic empires.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text condemns 'evil innovation,' which could refer to the Safavids' practice of enslaving Christians and incorporating them into their military forces, a practice seen as heretical by the Ottomans. This action led to the ire of Islamic empires such as the Ottoman Empire. The letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I, 1514, further highlights this conflict. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires primarily because they enslaved Christians and incorporated them into their military forces.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a Jewish trader facing marital strain due to long periods of separation and financial hardship. The most probable cause of this strain is the strain placed on merchant families by these factors, as mentioned in option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The husband's mention of returning home 'with nothing' and offering his wife a bill of repudiation implies financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy as the main source of marital stress. This is further supported by the fact that he cannot blame her for waiting too long, which indicates that she has been experiencing hardship on her own. Therefore, the most probable cause of the marital strain evident in this passage is financial difficulties.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage provided is a statement made by Ghanian leader Kwame Nkrumah, who was addressing the issue of African unity and its impact on the world's perception of Africa. In this context, the passage clearly exemplifies an argument for the importance of political union in Africa, as well as its potential to project a more positive image of Africa in the international community.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the UN's inaction in the Congo and advocates for African unity, suggesting a call for greater UN involvement and intervention in resolving African issues. This aligns with option B: 'A plea for the United Nations to intervene in Africa'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The French Revolution, which took place from 1789 to 1799, was marked by a strong leading figure. Robespierre, who served as the head of the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror, gained immense power and influence during this period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lafayette was a key figure in supporting revolutionary movements, and his involvement in the American Revolution suggests he might have held a similar position in France. The French Revolution allowed Jean-Paul Marat to assume great power, which is consistent with Lafayette's role as a supporter of radical politics. Therefore, it is most appropriate to choose Jean Lafitte as the leading figure who assumed great power during the French Revolution.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The political philosophy espoused in Machiavelli's 'The Prince' is fundamentally different from those of the medieval period. One key difference lies in the ethos and approach to governance. In the medieval period, monarchs were often viewed as justified in asserting their authority, based on divine right or tradition. Machiavelli, however, rejected this notion and instead emphasized the importance of pragmatic considerations, such as maintaining a strong military force, forging alliances with other powerful nations, and ensuring that one's actions are in the best interests of their subjects. This shift in perspective from a purely ethical or religious ideology to a more pragmatic approach to governance can be seen as a significant departure from the political philosophies of the medieval period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's focus on practical strategies for maintaining power implies a disregard for traditional social structures and a more egalitarian approach to governance. This contrasts with the medieval period, during which monarchies were typically absolute rulers who held their power through fear rather than strategic planning. In addition, Machiavelli's emphasis on individualism and self-interest, as opposed to a collective or communal approach, is also a departure from the norms of medieval society.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Selim I to Shah Ismail I, dated 1514, is most clearly an example of peacemaking efforts among the Islamic empires. This can be inferred from the context provided in the question, which mentions that Selim I's letter addresses the issue of extirpation and expulsion of evil innovations within the Islamic order. By addressing this matter, Selim I is likely trying to foster a sense of unity and cooperation among the various Islamic empires at that time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter highlights internal divisions and the need for drastic measures, suggesting a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and its eventual collapse. In addition to this, the letter also emphasizes the importance of peaceful coexistence among Islamic empires, which is in stark contrast with the content of the question. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be factors that brought about the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Al-Zawawi lived in a time period around 1300\u20131384 C.E., which falls within the period of 600\u20131450 C.E. mentioned in the question. The passage also discusses trade routes, taxation, and employment practices during this time period. Therefore, it supports the statement that the period 600\u20131450 C.E. was characterized by various aspects of international trade and economic relations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Extensive trade networks, as described in the passage, often facilitate the transmission of diseases across different regions and populations. The passage mentions that 'There is nothing in my kingdom, Musa said, on which a duty is levied except this crude copper which is brought in.' This implies that the economy of the region was heavily dependent on trade, particularly with copper mining activities. Given these factors, it can be concluded that diseases spread along trade routes during the period 600\u20131450 C.E.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two sources provide information about the political philosophy of the period circa 1750\u20131900 C.E., specifically focusing on Gran Colombia and Brazil's Empire. In both cases, it is evident that constitutions were established to govern these nations' political systems. These constitutions decreed representative governments for their citizens, which contradicts option B (Monarchs exerted a great deal of influence in their nations' governments).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on establishing formal governments and outlining their structures suggests a response to the growing social complexities and demands brought about by industrialization. In this period, political philosophy was heavily influenced by Enlightenment ideas that emphasized reason, individual rights, and democratic principles. The two sources provided illustrate how these ideas were applied in establishing constitutional governments with clear roles for monarchs, representatives, and religious freedom.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s brought about significant changes, including the spread of Islam and the establishment of a centralized bureaucracy. However, one of the long-term consequences was that Russia became excluded from Western European developments (like the Renaissance). This exclusion can be attributed to factors such as cultural differences, religious tensions, and political instability.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' openness to different faiths likely facilitated the spread of Islam, which eventually became the dominant religion in Russia. This shift was a direct consequence of the Mongol conquest of Russia in the 1200s.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Cawnpore massacres, where British citizens were brutally murdered by Indian rebels. From the perspective of the first passage, this event seems to mark a betrayal of a 'higher' race by a 'lesser' race. The British were seen as the dominant and superior race, while the Indians were considered inferior and uncivilized. This misconception was further fueled by the colonial government's denial of any 'humanness' to the Indian people.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the conflict involved a religious dimension, suggesting the killings at Cawnpore were driven by a sense of religious duty and a desire to re-establish native religions. In this context, option D, 'was seen by those who killed them as a religious duty,' is the most accurate explanation for the deaths at Cawnpore.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness mentions that he allows his children to work at places where they are ill-treated or overworked. This indicates a lack of understanding about the importance of child labor laws and conditions, which can lead to exploitation and harm for the children involved.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness likely believes that his children need the discipline and structure provided by factory work, even if the conditions are harsh. This belief may stem from a desire for his children to have a stable and secure future, rather than allowing them to remain unemployed or engaging in alternative forms of labor. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that the witness allows his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated because their labor is only moderately difficult.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Purusa is the lord of immortals and plays a crucial role in the formation of various castes in ancient India. It also states that the caste system was born from the sacrificial offerings made to Purusa. Based on this information, we can conclude that option C: 'The caste system reinforced Indian identity in the face of Muslim invaders.' is supported by the passage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The caste system likely emerged as a way to strengthen Hindu identity and unity in the face of challenges from Muslim invaders. The passage mentions that the gods sacrificed with the sacrifice to the sacrifice, indicating a strong sense of community and shared beliefs among the early Hindus. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the caste system was integral to the Hindu religion, transcending historical eras.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the conditions under which a French officer in Algeria encountered and enslaved Africans, primarily black people from North Africa. It highlights that these slaves were captured passively due to their fear of retaliation or punishment. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the passage mentions that some slaves rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and refused to walk, indicating a passive acceptance of their capture.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that young female slaves fetched higher prices, likely due to their strength and ability to perform demanding physical tasks. This suggests that adult male slaves were not as highly valued, which aligns with option D. However, the passage does not explicitly state this information, so we must rely on our interpretation based on the given context.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh realities faced by soldiers in the frontier garrisons during the Tang Dynasty. The author emphasizes the unrest and hardships experienced by the people living nearby, particularly in the Shanxi region. This context clearly indicates that the succeeding Song dynasty differed from the Tang in terms of governance, societal structure, and foreign policy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on the hardships caused by constant warfare suggests a departure from Confucian values and the civil service examination system, which emphasized education and social order. In this context, the most appropriate answer is that the Song dynasty differed from the Tang in abolishing the Confucian civil service exams.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were offering expanded trading privileges (1793). The emperor expresses his disinterest in strange and costly objects, stating that he has no use for your country's manufactures. This indicates a clear rejection of the British goods offered as tribute. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an offense at a perceived bribe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's lack of interest in the British goods suggests a recognition of their superior technology and a desire to acquire such advancements for China. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Chinese emperor was offended or bribed by the British Ambassador. Instead, it is more likely that the emperor's reaction can be attributed to his respect for the British King and his desire to maintain a positive relationship with foreign powers.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a Jewish trader in India writing to his wife in Cairo about the impending divorce due to his long-awaited wish for relief from his home country. This context clearly refers to historical developments such as the formation of far-flung diaspora communities as a result of interregional commerce (option A). The passage does not support options B, C, or D.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter's discussion of divorce within a Jewish context reflects the evolving family structures and practices among polytheistic populations during this period. Polytheism, which was prevalent in many regions including India, allowed for multiple gods to coexist alongside each other. This religious tolerance enabled families to adapt their structure and practices as they navigated the changing social landscape. The passage highlights that polytheistic families were not bound by strict monotheistic doctrines regarding marriage and family relationships, which allowed for greater flexibility in addressing issues such as divorce.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that zamindars, who paid revenue to the Mogul Empire, had an ability to establish a claim to sovereignty largely due to the Mughal Empire's policy of religious toleration. This policy allowed the Mughals to maintain control over their vast empire without resorting to martial law or universal taxation. Instead, they focused on maintaining a balance between religious and political authority, which ultimately contributed to the stability and prosperity of the Mughal Empire.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The zamindars' power to claim sovereignty likely stemmed from the Mughal Empire's implementation of suffrage, which empowered local leaders and gave them greater autonomy. However, it is important to note that while the Mughals did grant some degree of political freedom to zamindars, they also imposed heavy taxes and military service obligations on these individuals. This combination of factors likely contributed to the zamindars' ability to establish a claim to sovereignty.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given chart illustrates literacy rates among Russian speakers from late Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union, spanning over six decades. We can observe a steady increase in literacy rates during this period, culminating at an astounding 99.9% in 1955.\n\nThis historical context is best understood within the broader framework of centralized and state-directed campaigns of modernization that characterized the Soviet Union's development from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. During this period, the government sought to improve the socio-economic status of its citizens by implementing various reforms and policies.\n\nOne of the key aspects of these modernization campaigns was the emphasis on literacy as a means of improving the educational capabilities of the population. By increasing literacy rates, the government hoped to enhance the overall cognitive abilities and productivity of its citizens, ultimately contributing to the socio-economic success and stability of the nation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant rise in literacy rates suggests the implementation of syndicalist economic policies, which often emphasize worker education and participation in decision-making. In this context, the given chart would best be understood as part of a second-stage industrialization in the non-Western world, where Russia underwent significant socio-economic transformations during the early 20th century.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the importance of preserving peace and upbuilding nations, which are central themes in the development of non-aligned movements. In particular, Sukarno's keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955 is a significant milestone in this regard. Therefore, it can be concluded that the passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on unity and progress among Asian and African countries aligns with the goals of the Green Revolution, which aimed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce poverty in developing nations. The passage highlights Sukarno's keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955, where he spoke about the importance of peace and unity among Asian and African countries. This development is most closely associated with the Green Revolution.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to two significant immigration laws: the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States). Both acts were enacted during a time when European and American colonial powers sought to control the flow of immigrants from Asia, particularly India and China. The primary goal behind these laws was to prevent the influx of Asian laborers into the United States, which could have led to exploitation, social unrest, and cultural assimilation challenges for American society. Based on this information, it is clear that European and American colonial domination of India and China formed the background for the enactment of these laws.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The immigration laws described in the passages were likely a response to European and American colonial domination in India and China, as these powers sought to control the movement of people and resources within their empires. This trend was further exacerbated by the growing appeal of Christianity among Indian and Chinese populations, which led to increased demand for labor and religious conversion services. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act were both designed to address these issues by limiting the movement of people from certain regions within their respective countries.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the invaders brought in various Eurasian and African grains, peach, pear, orange, lemon trees, chick-peas, grape vines, melons, onions, radishes, and more. This massive introduction of new crops into Europe would have led to a significant increase in crop diversity, which is generally beneficial for the overall health and productivity of agricultural systems. Therefore, option A accurately reflects the impact of this process on Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The large-scale export of crops from the New World to Europe likely resulted in food shortages and famine, leading to a decline in the European population. This was due to the fact that many people were unable to afford the imported grains necessary for survival. In addition, the increased competition for resources among Europeans may have contributed to further population declines.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, who writes to Queen Victoria about the benefits of China's exports. This letter is from 1839, which falls within the late Qing Dynasty and early British colonial rule in China. During this period, Europe was actively expanding its influence over China through various means, including trade, missionary activity, and colonization. The passage highlights that European countries were aware of the potential benefits of China's exports to their own economies. However, it also raises concerns about the potential harm caused by certain products, such as opium, which were exported from China to other European countries. In conclusion, the passage is most closely related with Europe's expansion of its influence over China during the late Qing Dynasty and early British colonial rule.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's condemnation of the opium trade suggests that it was seen as a form of enslavement, with Europeans forcing the Chinese population into addiction and dependence. This perspective is most closely related to European's colonization of Chinese territory, which led to significant social and economic disparities between the two regions.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the fifth paragraph of Mahatma Gandhi's 'The Pilgrims' March, 1921, is best understood as a protest against foreign cloth and its consumption. This movement was part of Gandhi's Swadeshi programme, which aimed to promote self-sufficiency in India by reducing reliance on imported goods. The boycott was not only a political statement but also a practical measure that helped to create awareness about the importance of national self-reliance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the passage likely reflects Indian labor's efforts to improve working conditions and gain greater rights through collective action. This context is best understood in the context of Indian labor's collectivization and agitation for better working conditions, which was a significant movement during this period.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Persia's influence in Arabia during the late third century C.E. was marked by a confluence of cultural, religious, and political exchanges. This suggests that Persian armies were not largely in control of Arabia throughout this period. Instead, it appears that Persia maintained a balance of power with Arabia, engaging in various forms of interaction such as trade, cultural exchange, and the establishment of religious centers like Naqsh-e-Rustam.\n\nBased on these points, option B: 'Persian armies were largely in control of Arabia throughout the period.' is not accurate. Instead, Persia's relationship with Arabia during this time was characterized by a balance of power and various forms of interaction.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages highlight the religious justifications used for warfare, with one source advocating for the spread of Islam through jihad and the other depicting peaceful interactions between Christians and Muslims. However, there is no mention of Persian armies being largely in control of Arabia throughout this period. In fact, the passage describes a complex interplay of religious and political forces that led to conflicts but did not necessarily result in one nation controlling another.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions that Western Europe achieved global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E., primarily due to geographical and ecological luck. Among the given options, none directly address this aspect of their respective historical events. However, option (A) - 'The colonization of the interior of Africa' - does seem somewhat related to Western Europe's rise to global power during that time period. While it is not a direct cause for their achievement of hegemony, it could be argued as indirectly contributing to their economic and military prowess.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes the need for resource exploitation from other continents, and Japan's isolationist policies during the Tokugawa period would have provided ample opportunity for such exploitation by Western Europe. This historical context supports the assertion that a ""quantum jump"" in productivity was necessary for Western Europe to achieve global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Peter the Great, despite being surrounded by evidence of new civil and political rights, did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people. Instead, he returned convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both direction and motive force. Based on this information, we can infer that Peter the Great embraced reforms such as development of a constitutional monarchy (C) and reduction of aristocratic influence (D).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to drive Russia forward and his willingness to use force suggest a desire to dismantle the existing power structures, including the aristocracy, in order to implement his reforms. In this context, we can infer that Peter the Great embraced constitutional monarchy as one of his key reforms. This is supported by the passage stating that he would try to lead but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive\u2014and if necessary flog\u2014the backward nation forward.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two passages discuss the contrast between how Christians and Muslims interact with each other, particularly in terms of hospitality and trade. The passage from Robert Irwin suggests that Christians should treat Muslim hermits kindly, while Ibn Jubayr's account shows that no such restrictions apply to Christian merchants. This discrepancy between the two sources highlights a significant difference in how religious beliefs influence interaction between cultures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that these passages best understand in the context of the influence of religion on interaction between cultures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription clearly demonstrates Persia's strong influence and authority in the region, suggesting that their military and political power would have extended to Arabia throughout the period. This is further supported by the fact that the Christians of Mount Lebanon were willing to share food and kindness with Muslim hermits, despite their religious differences. On the other hand, Christian merchants in Muslim territories were not stopped or hindered, indicating a level of tolerance and respect between these two groups. These observations lead us to conclude that the influence of religion on interaction between cultures was indeed significant during this period.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. W.H. Moreland, an authoritative source on India during Akbar's reign, provides a detailed account of revenue collection in the Mughal Empire. The passage highlights that there were instances where zamindars refused to pay revenue or paid it irregularly. This observation suggests that the empire did not rely solely on revenue collection as its primary source of funds. Instead, Moreland's description indicates that other factors such as geographical differences and religious affiliations may have influenced which groups were required to pay taxes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of revenue collection for the Mughal Empire's functioning, implying that it was the primary, if not the only, means by which the empire sustained itself financially. Moreover, the author discusses the existence of zamindars who paid taxes to the Mogul rulers but also highlights instances where these individuals refused or failed to pay their dues, suggesting that there were indeed other factors at play in determining whether a particular individual would be required to contribute funds to the empire's coffers. In conclusion, the passage provides evidence for generalization C: 'Revenue collection was the only source of funds by which the Mughal Empire operated.'",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the British Empire's Indian trade and the practices surrounding sati, a ritualistic practice involving the burning of a woman alive during her menstruation period. The author of this passage, William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, is against the continuation of sati as it is deemed an evil practice that causes suffering to innocent women. On the other hand, George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, shares a different perspective on this issue. He argues that by letting Indians feel their dependence on foodstuffs and manufactured goods sold by Europeans, colonial administrators can bring them in a proper state of subordination. This perspective highlights the importance of colonial administrative power over native peoples. Therefore, the best understanding of the practices discussed in these passages is that they reflect the exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the mobilization of military resources was a key strategy employed by colonial powers. The first passage refers to the British East India Company's efforts to suppress sati, while the second passage discusses George Simpson's views on maintaining control over native peoples through dependence on European goods and manufactures. These passages together provide strong evidence that mobilization of military resources was indeed a common practice among colonial powers.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of industriousness and ancestral worship for women in ancient China. It highlights that these virtues can be cultivated through specific rules, such as retiring late to bed but rising early to duties, performing domestic tasks, and living upright in character. By expressing these expectations, the passage encourages women to strive for a virtuous and fulfilling life.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman's role in supporting her husband and maintaining a harmonious household, suggesting a collaborative approach to domestic tasks and responsibilities. In ancient China, such expectations were deeply ingrained in societal norms and values.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to Indonesian leader Sukarno's speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955. In this context, we are looking for a historical event that Sukarno attempted to maintain a neutral stance during his time as a leader.\n\nThe provided choices include: A) The Arab-Israeli conflict, B) The Korean War, C) The Cold War, and D) The Vietnam conflicts.\n\nSince the question specifically mentions Sukarno's attempt to maintain a neutral stance during his speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955, we can eliminate choices A), B), and C). This leaves us with choice D): The Vietnam conflicts.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and reasoning, Sukarno attempted to maintain a neutral stance during his speech at the Bandung Conference in 1955 while dealing with the Vietnam conflicts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on peace and the mobilization of Asian and African nations suggests a direct response to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and its destabilizing effects on the region. The Arab-Israeli conflict is characterized by escalating tensions, violence, and the displacement of people. Sukarno's approach to peace would likely involve promoting dialogue, negotiation, and diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts and maintain regional stability.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Joseph Stalin delivered this speech at a significant historical event, the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry in February 1931. The context of this speech is primarily focused on the struggle against backwardness and weakness within the Soviet Union.\n\nStalin's speech emphasizes the importance of not lagging behind, which can be interpreted as a critique of capitalism's exploitative nature. He argues that those who are backward and weak should be beaten and enslaved by those who are mighty and impotent. This perspective aligns with Stalin's own beliefs about the need to combat backwardness and promote socialist development.\n\nIn summary, Joseph Stalin's speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry in February 1931 is best understood in the context of a struggle against backwardness and weakness within the Soviet Union.",A,Let's reason step by step. Stalin's focus on rapid industrialization and his fear of falling behind suggest a strong motivation to develop nuclear weapons as a means of ensuring the Soviet Union's security and dominance on the world stage. This historical development is closely related to Stalin's push to make the Soviet Union a nuclear nation.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both authors, William Bentinck and George Simpson, served institutions associated with Western imperial powers that commonly employed colonial techniques. For instance, both men were involved in governance of India under British rule. Their writings reflect the influence of these colonial techniques on their respective perspectives. Bentinck's advocacy for an open and general prohibition against sati, which he believed was a predicament surrounded by awful responsibility, can be seen as a reflection of the broader imperial policy of suppressing local customs and traditions in favor of more centralized authority. Similarly, Simpson's perspective on the necessity of ruling Indians with a rod of iron to maintain their subordination and dependence on British goods and services can be seen as an extension of these colonial techniques. Thus, both authors served institutions associated with Western imperial powers that commonly employed colonial techniques.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages emphasize the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the imposition of martial law and the presence of large armies were common colonial techniques. Martial law enforced by sizable armies would have been used to suppress dissent, maintain order, and enforce compliance with colonial policies.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, dated 1526, highlights a significant issue concerning human trafficking in the region. It mentions that many people are kidnapped and sold to white men in Portuguese-controlled areas. This situation reflects a growing concern about exploitation and trade in Africa during early modern times.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The king's complaints about the kidnapping of his people and their sale into slavery indicate a strong resistance against European attempts to conquer and colonize the region. This is a clear development in early modern Africa, which can be contrasted with other factors such as growing dependence on trade or vigorous resistance to European expeditions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the King and Queen of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Sicily, Granada, etc., insisted on Portuguese control over territory east of a demarcation line drawn north and south at a distance of three hundred and seventy leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. The primary reason for this insistence is likely to be related to economic interests, as mentioned in option C. Portuguese explorers had already discovered vast wealthy lands of Mexico, which were not under the control of any European nation at that time. By asserting their claim over these territories, the King and Queen of Castile aimed to secure their own economic prosperity and maintain their influence in the region.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese were known for their pursuit of wealth and resources, and the lands of Mexico, with their abundant gold and silver, would have been a highly desirable territory for them to control. Furthermore, the treaty explicitly mentions that the King of Portugal wishes to maintain his relationship with the King and Queen of Castile, Aragon, etc., which implies that Portuguese control over Mexico was not just a strategic decision but also a sentimental one for the Portuguese monarchy. Therefore, the most appropriate inference explaining the reason behind the King of Portugal's insistence on Portuguese control of territory east of the demarcation line is option C: 'The Portuguese desired control of the wealthy lands of Mexico.'",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'zamindar,' which is a Persian term that translates to 'landlord.' In the context of the Mogul empire, zamindars were often feudal landowners who paid revenue to the Mughals. These individuals held significant power and influence over their local communities. The characteristics mentioned in the question are not directly related to the definition of a zamindar. However, we can infer that they represent different social groups or religious affiliations. In this case, option D accurately defines the zamindars as Hindu aristocrats.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in the context of land and revenue, and since peasants are typically associated with agricultural activities and land cultivation, it's reasonable to assume that zamindars were a type of peasant class within the Mughal Empire. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Hindu aristocrats.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Albert Camus, a prominent French philosopher, wrote 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' which reflects on the human condition and the meaning of life. The passage discusses the idea that we may never truly understand the meaning of our existence because it transcends our current understanding. This perspective exemplifies Camus' modernist tendency to question the validity of faith-based moralities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the devastation and loss of faith caused by World War II, many people turned back to traditional religious values for comfort and guidance, and Camus' exploration of meaning and the human condition reflects this trend. In his essay, Camus critiques the notion that meaning can be found outside one's current circumstances, arguing that it is impossible to know what meaning truly means until one has experienced it firsthand.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage provided from Publius Cornelius Tacitus's Germania mentions several factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Among these, incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire are mentioned as one of the most significant contributors to its fall. This is evident from the passage stating that 'It did not even grudge us the spectacle of the conflict.' Moreover, the passage also highlights the destructive power of these invasions, with over sixty thousand Romans falling victim to them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the constant threat posed by barbarian incursions and intertribal conflicts, suggesting that these external pressures were the main cause of the Roman Empire's decline. Other factors mentioned include civil wars between rivals for the throne (A), the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire (C), and demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics (D). Therefore, the factor that contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire is the persistence of the senate as a body of government in the empire.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that 'At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity.' This statement directly refers to a 'quantum jump' in productivity, which is most likely what Alfred Crosby meant when he spoke about ecological imperialism. Ecological imperialism refers to the process by which one society exploits the resources of another society through trade and cultural exchange. This process was prevalent during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E., as mentioned in the passage.\n\nNow, regarding the question, it asks for which development in that period the 'quantum jump' most directly contributed to. The answer is ecological imperialism, as described above.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The exploitation of resources and the rapid increase in productivity often lead to social unrest and inequality, as different groups compete for access to wealth and power. In the context of Alfred Crosby's book 'Ecological Imperialism,' the term 'quantum jump' refers to a society that has achieved global hegemony through enormous increases in productivity. This development would have led to widespread social unrest, as different groups struggled for access to resources and power. In this case, the most appropriate answer is an increase in social unrest.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both Source 1 and Source 2 emphasize the importance of nonviolent resistance, which is a direct response to oppression and injustice. In Source 1, Martin Luther King Jr., highlights the need for tension within society to create a crisis that can lead to change. Similarly, in Source 2, the National Organization for Women emphasizes the urgent need for women to fully participate in mainstream American society and to exercise all their privileges and responsibilities in equal partnership with men.",A,"Let's reason step by step. All three sources advocate for social justice and equality, and achieving such goals often requires building alliances and solidarity with other movements fighting for similar causes. In Source 1, Martin Luther King Jr., emphasizes the importance of nonviolent resistance in creating tension and forcing change within society. Similarly, in Source 2, the National Organization for Women (NOW) also highlights the need for practical steps alongside discussions to achieve gender equality. Lastly, both sources recognize the importance of unity with other movements in order to build a stronger and more effective fight against oppression.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt discusses reincarnation in a manner that is similar to Hinduism, where karma plays a crucial role. In Buddhism, the concept of karma is also present but with some differences. For instance, Buddhists believe that there are no universal gods and reject the idea of a heavenly existence after death.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach about reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of this cycle of rebirth is to reach a state of enlightenment and ascend to a heavenly realm. In contrast to Hinduism's emphasis on various gods and goddesses, Buddhist doctrine rejects the validity of all gods. Instead, Buddhists focus on developing their own wisdom and understanding through meditation and other spiritual practices.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the British Govenor-General, William Bentinck, who advocates for an open and general prohibition of sati ritual in India. This implies that the British were motivated by a desire to prevent harmful practices from continuing.\n\nThe second passage highlights George Simpson, the Head of Northern Department at Hudson's Bay Company, who believes that British colonial rule can be maintained through economic dependence on Indian traders. This perspective suggests that the British sought to maintain their authority and control over India by exploiting its resources.\n\nCombining these two passages, we can conclude that the British motivations for eradicating the sati ritual were primarily driven by a desire to prevent harmful practices from continuing while also maintaining their authority and control over India through economic dependence on Indian traders.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The British were predominantly Christian and often sought to spread their religion in their colonies, so their opposition to the sati ritual likely stemmed from a desire to convert the Indian population to Christianity. However, it is important to note that while the British may have had these motivations, they were also aware of the potential consequences of such actions on the cultural and social fabric of their colonies. As a result, they took steps to ensure that the sati ritual was suppressed without causing further harm.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Maynard Keynes, a prominent economist of the twentieth century, proposed a theory known as Keynesian economics. This theory suggests that government intervention can help stimulate aggregate demand and alleviate poverty. In this case, Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany could be addressed by advocating for government intervention to help workers achieve better economic security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Keynes generally cautioned against excessive government intervention in the economy, believing that market forces should play a primary role in regulating economic activity. In this context, Otto von Bismarck's evaluation of workers in Germany is relevant to understanding how Keynes might address such concerns.\n\nBismarck was known for his conservative approach to economics and his belief that the government should play a limited role in managing the economy. In contrast, Keynes advocated for a more active role for the government in regulating economic activity, particularly in addressing issues such as poverty and unemployment.\n\nGiven these differences between Bismarck's and Keynes' views on economic policy, it is reasonable to conclude that Keynes would likely advocate for government intervention in order to address the concerns raised by Otto von Bismarck about workers in Germany. However, Keynes would likely emphasize the importance of balancing government intervention with market forces and ensuring that such policies are implemented in a way that is fair and equitable for all individuals involved.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text discusses the influence of religious beliefs on ancient societies, specifically focusing on Egyptian culture. The hypothesis being evaluated is that 'Ancient Egyptians believed that moral behavior affected one's fate after death.' To evaluate this hypothesis, we need to compare it with the information provided in the text. In the second text, it is mentioned that 'Those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves. Those to whom they forbid passage will not be able to cross the river of life.' This statement clearly supports the hypothesis that ancient Egyptians believed in the influence of moral behavior on one's afterlife fate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text clearly emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, suggesting that ancient Egyptians were deeply committed to elaborate rituals and offerings to appease their gods. This belief system likely played a significant role in shaping ancient Egyptian society's values and norms.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I, dated 1514, discusses the establishment of a new empire founded by Ismail I. This information is crucial for understanding the religious tradition that characterizes this empire. The passage mentions that both distinguished scholars and the Sunni community agree on the ancient obligation of extirpation, extermination, and expulsion of evil innovation. This agreement implies a shared belief system among these individuals, which is predominantly Sunni Islam. Therefore, the empire founded by Ismail I can be best characterized as a Sunni Islamic state.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the removal of ""evil innovation,"" which aligns with the Sikh tradition of extirpating hair as a way to dedicate oneself to God. Moreover, the letter from Ottoman Sultan Selim I to Safavid Shah Ismail I, dated 1514, further supports this claim since it was during the reign of Sultan Selim I that the Ottoman Empire began its expansion into Central Asia. This expansion coincided with the rise of various religious traditions in these regions, including the Sikh faith.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the contrast between Europe and China in terms of their weaponry during the Middle Ages. It highlights that European states, particularly those in Western Europe, invested heavily in gunpowder weapons due to their strategic importance in protracted sieges against nomadic enemies. In contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, focused its efforts on improving horse archer units rather than gunpowder weapons. This argument most closely relates to question B, which asks why European states went on to attain military superiority over non-Western powers in the modern era.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly compares the different approaches to gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, highlighting how societies strategically shared and adapted technologies based on their specific needs. This question asks about how societies shared strategically important technologies with each other, which is directly related to the information presented in the passage.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet Dennis Brutus refers to the 'world whispering' in relation to apartheid and its oppressive nature. This term implies that people from different backgrounds are unaware of the brutal realities faced by South Africans under apartheid. The world's silence, or lack of awareness, is a direct reflection of the systematic discrimination and oppression practiced by apartheid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poet contrasts the world's quiet disapproval of apartheid with South Africa's blatant actions, suggesting that the global economic system indirectly promotes and benefits from South Africa's discrimination. This is evident in the poem's reference to the world whispering about 'apartheid declares with snarling guns,' implying that the global community is complicit in perpetuating racial inequality. In conclusion, the poet means by 'what the world whispers' that the global economic system and the world's collective silence are actively supporting South Africa's discriminatory policies.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided comes from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text that discusses various aspects of Confucianism and ritual. In this particular passage, we are given a warning about the consequences of disregarding virtue. The phrase 'the ways of Heaven are not invariable' indicates that the actions of the gods are subject to change and cannot be relied upon as a constant guide for human behavior. This concept is central to Confucianism's teachings on duty, respect, and filial piety. Based on this understanding, we can conclude that the ruler in question does not have the Mandate of Heaven, as it implies divine favor and guidance. Instead, he seems to be operating under his own discretion and potentially failing to uphold virtue.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the former kings of Xia faced calamities due to their lack of virtue. This implies that the current ruler, who inherited their legacy, likely met a similar fate as a result of natural disasters. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that he was killed as a result of natural disasters.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Nicolo Machiavelli's views on loyalty and fear in political leadership. Machiavelli critiques the idea that a ruler should be loved rather than feared, arguing that it is difficult to unite these two qualities in one person. Instead, Machiavelli suggests that it is safer for a ruler to be feared than loved, as this allows them to maintain control over their subjects. The passage concludes by summarizing Machiavelli's criticism of the religious establishment and his belief in the fair-mindedness of political leaders.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's argument about the importance of fear over love in maintaining control clearly reflects a criticism of the religious establishment's reliance on faith and devotion, which he sees as unreliable tools for governance. In his view, the loyalty of rulers' subjects should be based on their ability to understand and apply reason, rather than on blind faith in a divine figure.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The argument presented in the question suggests that the caste system imposed rigid economic and social roles on Indian society during the period from 600 BCE to 600 CE. Now, let's examine each of the given options to see which one would best contradict this argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Krishna, mentioning four divisions created by him, reinforces the idea of a rigid caste system where individuals are born into specific roles with limited social mobility. However, contradicting this argument would require evidence that supports an alternative viewpoint on the caste system's origin and implications for society.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The fifth paragraph of the provided information refers to Mohandas Gandhi's message regarding non-violent resistance during the Indian independence movement. This message is particularly focused on boycotting foreign cloth and promoting Swadeshi products, which are key aspects of the struggle for self-determination and independence. The historical development mentioned as most assisting the ultimate success of this boycott is World War II (Option D). However, it's important to note that while World War II did have significant impacts on various regions around the world, including India, it was not directly responsible for the ultimate success of Gandhi's non-violent resistance campaign. The true cause of India's independence from British colonial rule is attributed to the efforts and leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and his followers during the Indian independence movement, which spanned several decades.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott's success was undoubtedly influenced by the decolonization process already underway in Africa, as it inspired and empowered Indians to resist colonial rule and demand independence. Additionally, the fifth paragraph of Gandhi's speech refers to the Maulana Mohammed Ah's arrest for his non-violent resistance against British colonial rule. This historical development provided a powerful example of how Indians could use non-violent means to achieve their goals.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviets would accept. This implies that there was some level of cooperation or understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union during this period, given that they were willing to negotiate a surrender agreement. However, it is also mentioned that Bonesteel knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. This suggests that there was still some tension or conflict between these two superpowers during this time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly depicts the US and Soviets working together to manage the surrender of Japanese forces, demonstrating their close collaboration and shared goals as comrades-in-arms. Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s further emphasizes this relationship.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Western Europe during the 1200s through the 1400s revolutionized their weaponry with gunpowder, whereas China's efforts were primarily focused on improving horse archer units against highly mobile nomads. This contrast challenges traditional views of world history that might have attributed China's relative lack of technological advancement to factors such as religious fundamentalism or dictatorial rule.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archers over gunpowder was a strategic choice based on their specific threats. This challenges the view that China's progress was hindered by religious fundamentalism, which often opposes technological advancements. Instead, it highlights the importance of understanding historical contexts and adapting strategies accordingly.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of unity and national development in Africa. Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's president, emphasizes that political independence alone is not enough to overcome colonial rule and achieve progress. Instead, he advocates for a strong union rooted in common purpose, planning, and endeavor. This aligns with the principles of Pan-Africanism, which aims to unite Africa under a shared vision and promote social justice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's call for African unity highlights the limitations of individual states and emphasizes the need for collaboration, suggesting a neocolonial approach where African nations work together under the guidance of former colonial powers. In this context, Pan-Africanism is an appropriate cause as it advocates for the unification of Africa through collective efforts, which aligns with Nkrumah's vision.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation from the Upanishads describes a spiritual experience that transcends mundane concerns and offers an understanding of ultimate reality. This spirituality is characterized by a deep connection with Brahman, which suggests a monistic or non-dualistic viewpoint. Furthermore, the speaker's expectation of an afterlife and their faith in a divine being without attributes aligns with the teachings of many Eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism. In conclusion, based on the quotation, it is true that the speaker's religion is likely to be a monistic or non-dualistic Eastern religion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's belief in an afterlife and the emphasis on faith suggest that salvation in this religion is achieved through right actions and right speech, earning favor with the gods. However, since there is also a mention of Brahman, which is often associated with monotheism, it can be inferred that this religion is indeed polytheistic.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck, a prominent German politician, delivered this speech in 1884 to address the growing social issues of industrialization and urbanization. Among his key points was the recognition that workers were often unsecured and vulnerable due to factors such as poverty, illness, and old age. Bismarck's speech led to the creation of laws that addressed these concerns and provided a more secure and dignified existence for workers. One of the most significant outcomes of Bismarck's speech was the establishment of public health care and pensions, which are essential components of modern social welfare systems.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's concern for worker insecurity and the lack of social safety nets clearly indicates that the resulting laws aimed to limit work hours in factories, providing workers with more stability and protection. The other options do not seem to be directly addressed or supported by Bismarck's speech.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to an African poet, Léopold Sédar Senghor, who wrote the poem 'To New York,' in 1956. This poem is lyrically rich and evokes strong emotions about the city of New York. Given this context, it's reasonable to infer that the phenomenon described could be attributed to a combination of factors such as transatlantic influences, preference for Western cultural advancements, and perhaps even a certain level of familiarity or fascination with the city of New York by African intellectuals. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that stronger transatlantic influences likely played a significant role in linking art in Afro-Eurasia with that in the Americas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet's lyrical portrayal of New York likely stems from the outmigration of Africans escaping political violence and seeking new opportunities in the United States, leading to a blending of cultural influences. This blend can be seen in the poem's vivid imagery and emotional depth, which resonate with readers who have experienced similar cultural shifts.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem discusses the harsh reality of taxation in frontier garrisons during the Han Dynasty, specifically referring to the third stanza where Du Fu mentions that the District Officers are demanding the land tax but struggling to find it from the villagers. This direct evidence points towards the existence of a systematic tax collection mechanism at the local level during this time period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of widespread conscription and tax collection suggests a relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, with a large population concentrated in cities, necessitating a strong bureaucracy for efficient administration. This aligns closely with the historical context of the Tang Dynasty, which was indeed characterized by a highly centralized and urbanized state.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, was aimed at establishing a collective security system among its participating countries. The treaty's primary objectives included preventing armed conflict and maintaining peace in Europe and North America. Several factors contributed to the signing of this treaty: (1) The need for a strong defense against potential aggressors, particularly the Soviet Union; (2) The desire to create a framework that would promote cooperation among nations; (3) The realization that a unified security system could help deter future conflicts and prevent unnecessary loss of life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty's emphasis on collective defense and the potential use of armed force suggests that it was signed in response to the monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities held by certain nations, prompting others to form an alliance for protection. This perspective aligns with option D, which states a monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities compelled nations to join the alliance out of fear.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song mentions 'Rhine and Prague,' which implies that these places hold some significance for the narrator's character, the Winter King. In this context, option C best explains why the narrator warns the Winter King to stay away from Rhine and Prague. These locations are strongholds of the Holy Roman Empire, which could imply that the Winter King has been involved in conflicts or disputes within these borders.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator's reference to Rhine and Prague suggests these are significant locations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage, possibly seeking redemption or spiritual guidance after his defeat. These places would be important destinations for a pilgrimage, as they are often associated with religious and cultural significance. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate explanation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about a religious movement ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in two specific passages. One passage is from John of Damascus's Apologia Against Those Who Decry Holy Images, ca. 730 C.E., and the other passage is from the Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea, 787 C.E. The sentiments in these passages seem to be against the use of holy images as a means to convey religious truths. This opposition is likely to have been present in the Sunni Islam movement, which emphasizes the importance of the Quran and the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over any other scripture or image.\n\nIn summary, the Sunni Islam movement was ideologically opposed to the sentiments about the use of holy images reflected in the passages.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages advocate for the use of holy images as tools for religious understanding, which directly contradicts the principles of Buddhism, a religion that emphasizes meditation and inner reflection over external representations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Buddhism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, is a crucial document that sets forth the principles and guidelines for maintaining peace and security in the North Atlantic region. Among its key provisions, Article 5 states that an armed attack against one or more of the signatory nations (in this case, Europe and North America) will be considered an attack against them all. Consequently, the signatory nations agree to assist each other in the event of such an attack by taking necessary action, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain security in the North Atlantic area. The United Nations, as a global organization founded on principles of sovereignty, non-aggression, and international cooperation, is an example of an organization dedicated to asserting peaceful ideologies over the world and promoting international cooperation in the pursuit of collective security.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of the United Nations in the treaty suggests it is an organization dedicated to asserting a particular ideological tenet over the world, promoting its values and principles as the basis for international relations. This aligns with option B, which states that the United Nations is an organization opposed to the use of force between nations in any situation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quotation from the Upanishads speaks about Brahman as 'He contains all works and desires and all perfumes and all tastes.' This implies that Brahman is omnipresent, encompassing everything within himself. Additionally, it states that 'He enfolds the whole universe and in silence is loving to all.' These phrases further emphasize Brahman's omnipresence and his love for all things.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Brahman as a spirit residing within the hearts of individuals, suggesting that he is found in a specific location, similar to the concept of Heaven in other religions. Furthermore, it emphasizes that Brahman enfolds the whole universe and loves all things without making any sound. These descriptions lead us to conclude that Brahman is indeed a spirit residing within the hearts of faithful individuals.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question compares the Mongol (post-classical) empire with the Persian (classical) empire. One of the key differences between these two empires is their treatment of conquered peoples. In the case of the Persian Empire, it allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. On the other hand, the Mongol Empire did not follow this practice. Instead, they imposed a strict form of administration on conquered territories, which led to the suppression of local customs and traditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of various religions and their vast empire encompassed diverse belief systems, likely leading to the creation of a new syncretic religion. On the other hand, the Persian Empire was founded on Zoroastrianism, which is a monotheistic religion. The Persians maintained this traditional religion throughout their empire's history and did not create a new syncretic belief system like the Mongols.\n\nComparing both empires, we can see that while the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures (Option A), the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion (Option D).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The verse in question refers to the city of New York, and it paints vivid images of its natural beauty and cultural richness. This imagery is reminiscent of the Romantic movement, which emphasized emotion, individualism, and nature over industrialization and societal norms. The verse's focus on New York's unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty aligns perfectly with the Romantic ideals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on nature, emotions, and vivid imagery aligns with the core principles of the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism and a connection to the natural world. This movement was characterized by its exploration of emotional depth, beauty, and the human spirit in contrast to the rationality and industrialization of previous periods. The poem's imagery is rich and evocative, making it an ideal candidate for inspiring the Romantic movement.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther, a renowned theologian and reformer, addressed the Christian nobility of the German nation in his letter. In this address, he expressed concerns about the Roman Catholic Church's influence on Germany, particularly through its powerful cardinals who held significant political power. Luther criticized these cardinals for their corrupt practices and their role in destroying the service of God by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of Rome. Among other reformers mentioned in the question, Martin Luther's views are most similar to those expressed by Ulrich Zwingli.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther were key figures in the Protestant Reformation and challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, so their views must have been similar. In fact, both men believed that the Pope's power was limited to spiritual matters only, while temporal matters should be under the direct control of the king or emperor. This is why Martin Luther criticized the creation of cardinals and the concentration of wealth in the hands of the Church, as these practices were contrary to his reformist principles.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage provided is an excerpt from the Rig Veda, which is one of the oldest and most significant religious texts in India. This text discusses various aspects of Hinduism, including the concept of sacrifice to the gods. In this case, the passage explains how Purusa, the lord of immortals, was offered as a sacrifice to the gods, which led to the creation of various elements in the universe. The most relevant element of Hinduism that can be explained using this passage is the importance of sacrifice to the gods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sacrifice that leads to the creation of the world and different castes, suggesting that good deeds and sacrifices are essential for achieving enlightenment and improving one's karma. In Hinduism, this concept is known as 'Dharma Chakra,' which refers to the wheel of duty, law, and morality. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to explain this passage in the context of Hindu religion is the importance of sacrifice to the gods.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Albert Camus, a prominent French philosopher, wrote ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" in 1955. This work is deeply rooted in existentialism, which emphasizes individual existence and freedom. The author's exploration of meaning, free will, and the human condition aligns with existentialist principles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's questioning of meaning and the nature of existence aligns with the principles of New Age syncretism, which seeks to blend various spiritual and philosophical perspectives. Camus' work, particularly his exploration of existential angst and the human condition, resonates deeply with this movement's emphasis on personal freedom, authenticity, and the pursuit of meaning in life.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Germanic tribes who drove out and exterminated neighboring tribes, such as the Chamavi and Angrivarii. This behavior is similar to that of civilized societies in the period between 600 BCE and 600 CE, where barbarian peoples were often relegated to a servile status through the laws of their host societies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the conflict between barbarian tribes and the Roman Empire, suggesting that barbarian peoples were often converted to Christianity as part of their integration into Roman society. This treatment is similar to the one mentioned in the question for the period 600\u20131450 C.E., which also involved the conversion of barbarian peoples to Christianity. Therefore, this answer is most closely related to the given information.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given text mentions that European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867 due to various reasons, one of which is the British crown offering incentives for establishing homesteads in unsettled lands. This clearly indicates that the British government played a significant role in encouraging European settlers to move to Zulu lands.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference established clear boundaries and regulations for European colonization in Africa, making it easier for Europeans to move to Zulu lands and establish settlements. This decision was likely influenced by the desire of European powers to secure their interests in the newly discovered continent. As a result, many European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Olympe de Gouges' Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen, published in 1791. Halima Ghomri's interview from the 1970s after Algeria's war of independence also highlights the struggle for women's rights during this period. The question asks about one of the political outcomes described below. Among the given options, option D seems to be most closely related to the passage and the historical context, as it mentions that French women remained without full political rights until well into the following century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the disappointment and frustration of women who had hoped for greater equality after the French Revolution, suggesting that their status actually declined as they faced continued discrimination and exclusion from political life. This outcome is in stark contrast to many other groups that gained political equality during this period, such as Jews, Protestants, and freed blacks. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be that French women did not attain political equality after only a short delay.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song 'Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!' is a critique of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his decision to seize the Bohemian throne from his nephew Charles IV in 1620. This act was seen as an unjust usurpation, which led to widespread discontent among the German states. The underlying issue in this song is social class conflicts, specifically between the Habsburg monarchy and the Bohemian lands.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The song's mocking tone and criticism of the ""Winter King"" suggest underlying social class conflicts and resentment towards the privileges and authority of the ruling elite. In this case, the most important underlying issue is a social class conflict.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'To Roosevelt' by Ruben Dario, 1904, is a powerful critique of the United States and its role as an invader in Latin America. The poet emphasizes that the United States has been too naive to recognize the true nature of Latin American culture and society. Instead, the poet argues that the United States should have fought back against the Spanish colonizers who had brought misery and destruction upon the indigenous peoples of Latin America. The poem concludes by stating that change is necessary for progress, and that the United States must recognize its own limitations and responsibilities in order to truly contribute to the betterment of Latin American society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem acknowledges the power and influence of the United States while emphasizing the resilience of Latin American culture, suggesting that change and progress are inevitable, even if they come through external forces. In this case, the most appropriate answer reflects the theme of the poem by highlighting the importance of change and progress.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Kwame Nkrumah, a Ghanian leader who emphasized the importance of Africa's unity and political union to achieve peace in the world. Nkrumah' argument is most clearly supported by Pan-Africanism, which advocates for the unity, equality, and brotherhood of all people of African descent. The passage also mentions that Nkrumah' vision of a political union would serve as an example to a divided world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's emphasis on African unity and self-determination aligns with the principles of neocolonialism, which sought to maintain European influence in Africa through economic and political partnerships. However, Nkrumah's argument most clearly supports Pan-Africanism, an ideology that advocates for the unity and self-determination of all African people, regardless of their ethnic or cultural backgrounds.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a poem written during the Middle Kingdom, ca.1800 BCE. This context provides us with valuable information about the time period and cultural values of Egyptian society. In this case, the text of this passage is best seen as evidence of a clan as the basic political unit (Option C).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a champion representing his tribe and seeking to take the narrator's cattle, indicating that clans were the basic political units in Egyptian society and played a significant role in conflicts and rivalries. This aligns with option C: 'The clan as the basic political unit'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text refers to two authors, Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth, who were both speaking about the French Revolution. This indicates that the intellectual foundations of the eighteenth-century political revolutions were based on the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a philosophical movement that emphasized reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were influenced by the principles of mercantilism, which emphasized economic competition and the accumulation of wealth through trade and colonization. The intellectual foundations of these political revolutions were based on the Enlightenment, a philosophical movement that promoted reason, individualism, and skepticism towards traditional authority.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first paragraph describes the Portuguese's extensive trading activities, particularly with Japan and China. They carry a variety of goods such as silk, gold, musk, porcelain, silver, and coins from India. These items are highly valuable and lucrative for merchants like the Portuguese. The paragraph also mentions that these traders employ their profits to advantage in China. This implies a significant level of control over Chinese trade routes and markets. Based on this information, it is most directly supported that Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade occurred during the time period described.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese trade route between Macao and Japan, highlighting the exchange of goods and the presence of Portuguese merchants, which suggests the influence of Jesuit missionaries who often accompanied traders and facilitated cultural exchange. Furthermore, the passage mentions that Portuguese sailors must comply with certain rules regarding their stay in Canton, indicating a level of control and regulation exercised by the Portuguese over their trading activities. In conclusion, the description of the route Portuguese sailors took most directly supports historical development A: Chinese merchants' domination of East Asian trade.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author begins by highlighting the importance of prohibiting harmful substances like opium in China, which has been done with utmost strictness and severity. This is a strong proof that the Chinese government knows full well how hurtful it is to mankind. The author then discusses Lin Zexu's letter to Queen Victoria, where he argues that China exports beneficial products to foreign countries without any harmful substances. Based on this argument, the author principally bases his appeal on the idea that it is hypocritical for one country to sell a substance banned as harmful in its own.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes China's economic and moral superiority over Britain, suggesting that Britain should fear the potential military consequences of its harmful opium trade and China's righteous anger. The author's appeal is principally based on his argument that it is hypocritical for Britain to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own. This argument serves to illustrate the author's deep-seated belief in the importance of moral and ethical principles in international relations.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses testimony from a man named Joshua Drake, who speaks about his views on moderate labour and lower wages. He mentions that he has no wages but two days a week at present, and describes how working in different jobs can lead to varying income levels. Drake also expresses concern about the conditions under which his children work, suggesting that they are often subjected to ill-treatment or overworking. Based on these points, it is clear that the style of government described in the passage is most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system with minimal government intervention in business and labor practices, aligning with the principles of corporatism, where the state and corporations work together to regulate the economy and social affairs. In contrast, laissez-faire refers to an economic system characterized by minimal government control over businesses and markets, which may lead to unregulated competition and market failures. The passage does not explicitly mention laissez-faire or any other specific style of government, but it can be inferred that the described system is most closely associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the harsh conditions faced by poor Indians in Spanish South America, particularly during the mining era. These conditions include torture, death, and exploitation of labor without compensation or fair treatment. The passage also reveals that these atrocities are perpetrated by mine owners who exploit their power and influence to maintain control over the Indian population. This evidence suggests that debt slavery is a significant factor in the socio-economic conditions faced by Native American subjects in Spanish South America.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in Spanish South American mines, indicating that the king of Spain was likely unaware of or unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects in the colonies. This lack of concern for the welfare of Native American subjects is a clear indication of the presence of social stratification based on origin of birth.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the French Revolution and the American Revolution were responses to a transformation in the social class structure. In France, the monarchy was abolished and replaced with a republic, leading to widespread social unrest. Similarly, in America, the colonists gained independence from Britain due to their dissatisfaction with the social hierarchy that perpetuated economic inequality.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were fueled by discontent with the power and influence of religious leaders, who often held significant political and economic authority, similar to the challenges posed during the Protestant Reformation. In both cases, these religious figures were seen as oppressive and corrupt, leading to widespread unrest and resistance against their rule.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Simón de Bolívar, born in Santa Marta, Colombia, was a liberator and statesman who played a pivotal role in the struggle for independence in South America. His accomplishments include leading the successful Revolution of 1809 against Spain's colonial rule, organizing the first independent Latin American states (the United Provinces of New Granada), and establishing the Spanish American War (1826-1828) as a means to assert Colombia's sovereignty over its territories. Bolívar's legacy continues to inspire movements for social justice, democracy, and human rights around the world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes Simón Bolívar's mixed-race identity and his struggle against both Spanish rule and native resistance, suggesting that he likely led a political coup to challenge the existing power structures and assert the rights of mixed-race individuals. This aligns with option D, which is the first political coup by someone of mixed-race descent.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta's journey was a comprehensive exploration of the Muslim world, particularly in North Africa and the Middle East. He documented his experiences extensively, including his observations about various cultures, their customs, religions, and economies. In contrast, Zheng He's voyages were primarily focused on China, its maritime trade routes, and exploration of new lands. Although both individuals made significant contributions to their respective fields, Ibn Battuta's experiences were LEAST similar to the experiences of Zheng He.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. However, the question asks for which of the following individuals' experiences were LEAST similar to Ibn Battuta's. Since Zheng He is also a traveler who documented his journeys extensively, it stands to reason that their experiences would be more similar than those of Ibn Battuta. Therefore, the answer must refer to someone whose experiences were significantly different from both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author cites Walter Rodney's book, 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,' published in 1974. In this work, the author discusses how Western European capitalists actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. This assertion directly supports the given choice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment is supported by this historical fact. Furthermore, Rodney's book 'How Europe Underdeveloped Africa' provides a comprehensive analysis of various factors contributing to African underdevelopment during the 19th and early 20th centuries.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage provided is a quote from Simón de Bolívar, who was a key figure in the struggle for independence in South America. In this context, we are discussing the political movements of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, which were characterized by the fight for national liberation from foreign rule. Bolívar's message to the Congress of Angostura in 1819 is a powerful call for resistance against Spanish colonial rule in South America. This passage best understands in the context of the fight for independence in South America.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text clearly describes a population seeking self-governance and resisting external control, aligning with the concept of political autonomy. In this case, Bolívar's Message to the Congress of Angostura in 1819 is best understood in the context of fighting for political autonomy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Germania, under Roman rule, faced numerous conflicts with various tribes, including the Chamavi and Angrivarii. These conflicts were not driven solely by economic gains or religious conversions but rather by a combination of factors such as hatred for tyranny, attractions to plunder, or favorable divine intervention. The passage also emphasizes that while the Roman army and weapons played a significant role in these conflicts, it was not the sole cause of their destruction. Instead, it highlighted the importance of unity among the tribes against each other, as well as the potential consequences of discord and conflict. Based on this information, option C is most directly supported by the passage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that empires benefited from the influx of barbarian peoples who could contribute to the empire's workforce and economic growth. However, it also highlights a more sinister aspect of imperialism: the willingness of empires to engage in brutal conflict with neighboring tribes. In this case, the passage directly supports conclusion C, which states that empires used military force against all neighboring barbarian peoples as a means of expanding their influence.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given chart illustrates a steady increase in literacy rates among Russian-speaking populations from late Imperial Russia to the Soviet Union, 1897\u20131955. This trend is indicative of significant progress made towards education and literacy during this period. A historian sympathetic to Soviet communism would most likely use this chart as evidence to support the proposition that 'Communism has been made to work more efficiently in Russia than in China.' This statement is based on the assumption that a higher literacy rate would translate into better educational outcomes, which could potentially lead to improved economic performance and social stability. However, it's important to note that this reasoning relies heavily on assumptions and may not fully capture the complexities of Soviet history.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The dramatic rise in literacy rates suggests that the Soviet Union's communist system was more effective in achieving its goals compared to other communist nations like China. This is evident from the fact that Russia's literacy rate reached 99.9% by 1955, a remarkable accomplishment under Soviet rule. In contrast, China's literacy rate remained relatively low throughout the same period.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii's letter highlights the concerns of Japan regarding their outdated systems, particularly those related to military power and international relations. The response given in option C is most relevant as it directly addresses these concerns. In contrast, options A, B, and D do not provide a direct answer to the question.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To address the concerns about foreign powers, Japan likely needed to completely reform its outdated systems, starting with the Chinese-style civil service. This was a necessary first step in order to establish a modern and efficient government that could effectively counterbalance any potential threats from foreign states. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that the government dismantled the Chinese-style civil service system.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was a significant piece of legislation that sought to prevent Chinese immigrants from entering the United States. This act, along with its successor laws like the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (Revised Statutes), played a crucial role in shaping anti-immigrant sentiments during the late 19th century. In this context, option C accurately reflects the growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad that was influenced by these historical legislative actions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the selective nature of immigration policies, aiming to attract skilled workers while restricting the entry of unskilled laborers. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 specifically targeted Chinese immigrants, whereas the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia) sought to prevent the entry of Chinese laborers into Australia. Both acts demonstrate a growing desire to attract skilled labor from abroad while addressing concerns about the potential for exploitation and social unrest.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a speech given by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 CE. In this speech, Urban II speaks about Jerusalem and Constantinople being held captive by their enemies. This event most directly inspired Urban's invocation of Constantinople in the first paragraph.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire. These events were recorded in historical texts such as the De Administrando Imperio by Martin Luther, which further emphasizes the importance of Constantinople's defense against external threats. In this context, Urban II's invocation of Constantinople most directly inspires the event of the conquest of Constantinople by the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's concept of the 'socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture' in China refers to the process whereby rural communities will be transformed from being primarily dependent on individual land ownership and private property into a more cooperative, collective, and state-controlled system. This transition is essential for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance by eliminating the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The socialist transformation likely involved a shift of agricultural workforce towards industrial centers, contributing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This concept is supported by Mao Zedong's statement that 'agricultural co-operation must be carried out with the aim of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.' In this context, agricultural co-operation implies a shift from traditional farming to more modern and efficient systems, which would ultimately lead to the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The chart provided shows a steady increase in literacy rates among various segments of the Russian/Soviet population from 1897 to 1955. This trend suggests that education played a significant role in improving the overall quality of life for these communities. Among the given options, the urban middle class is typically characterized by higher socio-economic status and better access to educational resources compared to other segments of the population. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that members of the urban middle class would have benefited most from the rising literacy rates depicted in the chart.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increased literacy would greatly benefit the clergy, allowing them to better interpret and disseminate religious texts and teachings to the population. The rural peasantry, who often have limited access to education due to geographical constraints, could also benefit from increased literacy rates, as it would enable them to read and write more effectively, contributing to their overall socio-economic status.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a tale from ancient Egypt, specifically Sanehat's conflict with his rival champion. This story illustrates how conflicts between states were not only common but also had significant political implications for the rulers of early civilizations.\n\nThe most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers was victory against outsiders granting legitimacy to leaders of states. In Sanehat's case, his victory over his rival champion not only allowed him to defend his territory but also demonstrated his superiority and military prowess.\n\nThis victorious experience granted Sanehat the confidence and prestige needed to become a respected leader within his state. As a result, he was able to incorporate the elites of the subjugated into the conquering power, thus strengthening the political structure of his state.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflicts between states primarily served to provide the victors with a source of slaves and resources, which were crucial for sustaining their agricultural systems and economies. The rulers of early civilizations recognized this value in conflict and often employed tactics such as coercion, pillage, and enslavement to achieve their objectives. Thus, the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations was the acquisition of slaves and resources.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses various themes that were common in patriarchal ancient societies, such as industriousness, ancestral worship, and the importance of female purity and character. These themes reflect the values and beliefs held by these societies, which emphasized the role of women within the family and community structure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage underscores the importance of women fulfilling their roles in maintaining the household and upholding ancestral traditions through rituals and offerings. The themes of ancestor worship, purity, and systematic arrangement are all central to patriarchal ancient societies. These principles were often passed down from generation to generation, reinforcing social hierarchies and norms.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a U.S. cold war policy developed later, which is consistent with the U.S.'s concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy. Bonesteel's decision in the 1940s involved using the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. This policy, developed later, is known as containment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concern over Soviet expansion aligns with the Cold War strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, where the threat of retaliation deterred aggressive actions. However, Bonesteel's decision to establish a hypothetical line dividing Korean territory between Japanese forces and appointed American and Russian authorities indicates a different approach. This policy, which is consistent with U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy, can be referred to as Containment.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to two speeches given by Adolf Hitler and Winston Churchill, respectively. In the context of Source 1, Hitler's speech discusses the inevitability of war due to Germany's aggressive expansionism. In contrast, Churchill's speech from Source 2 is about Britain's unwavering determination to fight against Nazi Germany, despite facing significant challenges and potential defeat.",D,Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. The context of growing resistance movements in Eastern Europe (option A) and appeasement of the Axis powers (option C) are not directly supported by Churchill's speech. Trade deals with American manufacturers (option B) align more closely with his concerns about Britain's defense against Nazi Germany (option D).,B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first paragraph discusses trade patterns between Portugal and Japan during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. One of the key factors mentioned is that Portuguese traders brought silver from Japan, while they carried white silk, gold, musk, and porcelain to Japan. The second paragraph refers to Ralph Fitch's account of his travels to the Far East in 1599 C.E., which mentions several developments during that period. Among these developments, the one most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is the Portuguese conquest of India (B). The establishment of Portuguese colonies in India led to a significant decline in trade between Europe and Asia, as European powers focused on their own territories. This shift in trade patterns had a profound impact on the economic relationships between various regions during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and subsequent control over trade routes in the Pacific likely disrupted the established trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan. In particular, the Spanish monopolized the Atlantic slave trade, which had a significant impact on the economies of Africa, Asia, and Europe. As a result, the balance of power shifted in favor of European powers, leading to increased competition for trade routes and resources. This context directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph by disrupting the established monopolies of Portuguese traders.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage undermines traditional historical assumptions by showing that Muslims were on the whole kinder than Christians in the Middle East during the crusading era. This is evident from Ibn Jubayr's statement, where he mentions that not one Christian merchant was stopped or hindered in Muslim territories. In contrast, Mount Lebanon Christians round up hermits and treat them kindly, indicating a more cooperative relationship between the two communities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims. This undermines traditional historical assumptions by highlighting state-level antagonisms in the Middle East during the crusading era that were not always reflected in personal or economic life.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage mentions that William Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, wrote about the suppression of Sati. This implies that the author believed that the practice of Sati was detrimental to women's dignity and self-respect. The author also argues that allowing such practices would lead to a decline in the status of Hindu women. In contrast, George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, wrote about the importance of maintaining a balance between European imperialism and native religious practices. The author believed that Western imperialism could be beneficial to indigenous populations if it was done in a way that respected their cultural norms and values. In summary, the first passage can be said to undermine the commonly held assumption that European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage demonstrates that European colonizers often intervened in the religious practices of native populations, as seen in the example of the suppression of sati. This indicates a lack of respect for indigenous beliefs and traditions, which is commonly held as an assumption about Western imperialism. Therefore, option A accurately undermines this commonly held assumption.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to historical developments from the period 1450\u20131750 C.E., which is known as the Mughal Empire era. One of the most significant events during this time was the conquest of India by rival Muslim empires, particularly the Ottoman Empire.\nThe Maulana Mohammed Ahmad Gandhi, who lived during a period marked by religious and political turmoil, would have been deeply influenced by these historical developments. Inspired by the conquest of India, Gandhi's fifth paragraph instructs his followers to boycott foreign cloth.\nThis choice most closely aligns with the historical development of the Mughal Empire era, which was marked by a significant trade and cultural exchange between the Muslim world and the Hindu kingdoms. The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires would have had profound implications for this trade and cultural exchange.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The call to boycott foreign cloth likely drew inspiration from the historical experience of India under the rule of Muslim empires, where local industries suffered due to competition from imported goods. This period, spanning from 1450\u20131750 C.E., is known as the Maratha Empire's era of prosperity and cultural exchange. The Maulana Mohamed Ahmad Khan Gandhi, who was a prominent leader during this time, shared similar sentiments about the importance of preserving local industries and cultures. Therefore, it is most appropriate to choose 'The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires' as the historical development that inspired the instructions indicated in the fifth paragraph to boycott foreign cloth.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage clearly states that the Cawnpore Massacre was not justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms. This indicates a clear and unambiguous rejection of the massacre as a legitimate act of warfare. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that this event should be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the Cawnpore Massacre was a brutal event, it might be understood within the context of local military customs and traditions, which may differ from Western norms. Furthermore, the British government's response to the massacre, including the issuance of a proclamation condemning the act as treason, indicates that the British authorities viewed it as a serious violation of their rule. Therefore, while option A might seem justifiable according to local customs, option C can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Alfred Crosby, a historian known for his work on ecological imperialism, discusses the Western European colonization of North and South America during the period 1450\u20131750 C.E. This event is most likely a response to the development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India, which occurred around the same time. The passage suggests that these developments led to increased productivity in Western European societies, ultimately resulting in their global hegemony over other regions. Crosby's argument is most likely a response to this development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby's argument likely refers to the Industrial Revolution, where European nations needed vast resources and markets to fuel their industrial growth, leading to the exploitation of other continents. This period coincided with the development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India, which further solidified the colonial empires of Europe in Asia.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage mentions that the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined due to yasak tribute obligations. Among the reasons provided, option D directly addresses this issue: Overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals. This is a significant factor contributing to the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline in fur-bearing animals likely resulted from competition with Russian hunters and trappers who also sought these valuable resources, making it difficult for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. Moreover, the lack of horses due to pawning to yasak collectors further exacerbated this issue, as many native Siberians relied on hunting for subsistence.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vladimir Illyich Lenin, in his seminal work 'The Call to Power,' presented a radical critique of the existing political and economic systems. He argued that these systems were fundamentally flawed and could not provide the necessary foundation for the emergence of a new social order.\n\nLenin's primary philosophical underpinning was Marxism, which posits that history is driven by class struggle between the proletariat (working-class) and the bourgeoisie (middle-class). According to Lenin, the capitalist system, characterized by private ownership of the means of production and wage labor, had become incapable of providing a just society for its workers.\n\nIn conclusion, Lenin's call to power in Source 2 was grounded in his radical critique of Marxism, which he believed had failed to provide a viable alternative to the existing capitalist system.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's emphasis on seizing power and controlling resources aligns with the core principles of capitalism, where individuals strive to maximize their own wealth and control over the economy. In this context, the call to power in Source 2 is a philosophical underpinning that supports Lenin's vision for a new social order based on the principles of Marxism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem in question refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. This event symbolizes the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination because it epitomized oppression and the nature of society. More clearly than anything else, it was the classic event of racial dominance being more clearly defined and the will to oppress more clearly demonstrated.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Boer War, with its focus on racial tensions and power struggles, ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a more equitable society in South Africa. This event symbolized the end of South Africa's institutionalized discrimination as it marked a pivotal turning point in the country's history.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the Malians are Muslims and they follow Islamic practices such as prayers (salat), studying fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and learning the Qur'an by heart. These actions demonstrate a strong commitment to their religion, which is why we can conclude that the Malians take their Muslim faith seriously.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the Malians' openness to friendships between men and women outside of family, demonstrating their commitment to inclusivity and tolerance, which are central tenets of Islam. Furthermore, they study fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) faithfully, indicating a deep understanding of religious law. Lastly, the passage mentions that they are Muslims keeping to the prayers, which further supports the idea that their Muslim faith is taken seriously.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that our weakness is due to ralliying all vicious men against us. This implies that the speaker is most concerned with internal enemies, which in this context would be counterrevolutionary opponents. These individuals pose a direct threat to the stability and integrity of the French Republic.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against the enemies of the Republic suggests a fear of communist agitators who aimed to overthrow the existing social order and establish a classless society. Communism is a radical ideology that has been a significant threat to various forms of governance, including those based on democratic principles.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Peter the Great continued the practice of educating and persuading his people, as well as driving them forward when necessary. This aligns with the concept of reform, which is about making positive changes to improve a situation or system. In this case, Peter's actions can be seen as advocating for reforms in Russia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to modernize Russia and his willingness to use force suggest a belief in decentralizing power and empowering the people to participate in the decision-making process. This is in contrast to the isolationist policies of many European powers during that time, which sought to maintain their sovereignty and distance themselves from other nations. Thus, Peter's continued practice of reform and decentralization can be attributed to his belief in empowering the people and fostering a more dynamic and inclusive political system.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Confucian teachings on serving and respecting parents during their lifetime and after death. These teachings were used politically in China and its regions to reinforce social hierarchy, particularly between the ruling class and the common people.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Confucius' teachings on filial piety, with their emphasis on respect for parents and elders, aimed to promote gender equality by ensuring that both sons and daughters had equal responsibilities and rights within the family structure. This perspective was crucial in reinforcing social hierarchy and maintaining harmony within Chinese society.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that 'the owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants.' This directly supports conclusion C, as it highlights how the religious traditions and social customs of the New World were dramatically altered by the arrival of Europeans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment of indigenous populations and the disruption of their traditional ways of life, clearly demonstrating the dramatic alteration of New World religious traditions and social customs due to European influence. This directly supports conclusion C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given speech is delivered by Pope Urban II during the Council of Clermont in 1095 CE. This council took place in response to a crisis involving Jerusalem and Constantinople, which had been under siege by various Christian kingdoms. The speech discusses the historical context of this conflict, as well as Pope Urban II's call for Christians to unite against their enemies. Given that the speech is about a religious crisis in the Middle East during the 11th century, it can be most appropriately understood in the context of the Crusades.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe.  In this context, the Crusades can be seen as a direct response to the religious and political challenges posed by the Age of Discovery.  The Crusades were an effort to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, which was seen as a violation of Christian sovereignty.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the testimony before Parliament was given in 1831-32, which is during a time when labor unions were beginning to form and gain traction. These organizations sought to improve working conditions, wages, and hours for workers. In this context, it can be inferred that labor unions played a significant role in improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers during this era.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Joint-stock companies, with their focus on collective ownership and shared profits, played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and improving working conditions during the Industrial Revolution. The passage mentions that Joshua Drake, who was called in before Parliament to testify about his experiences at factories, criticized the system of wages and hours worked by children in those places where they were treated poorly or overworked.\n\nThis evidence indicates that labor unions, which are organized groups of workers with a common goal of improving their working conditions, wages, and benefits, were partially responsible for improving the hours, wages, and working conditions of workers during this era. However, it is important to note that while labor unions played a significant role in advocating for workers' rights, they were not the only organization involved in these efforts.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights that political independence is not enough to rid us of colonial rule's consequences. It also emphasizes the need for union, rooted in common purpose, common planning, and common endeavour. A lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion was most important in preventing the fulfillment of these political dreams.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Africa's struggle to achieve unity and progress can be attributed to its shortage of natural resources, which limited its economic potential and hindered its ability to compete on the global stage. However, despite these challenges, the passage emphasizes that political independence is not enough to rid us of colonial rule's consequences. The key factor preventing the fulfillment of the political dreams described in the passage appears to be a lack of common ethnicity, language, or religion among Africa's nations.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's quotation from On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955, is best understood in the context of communist countries where a worker-peasant alliance is being formed to consolidate socialism. The quote highlights the challenges faced by rural peasants due to the growing rich-peasant economy and individual economies. Mao's vision for overcoming these challenges lies in the establishment of co-operation, which will ultimately lead to the elimination of the rich-peasant economy and individual economies. This, in turn, will enable all rural peasants to become increasingly well off together, thus consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's concerns about the growing wealth gap and the potential for social unrest indicate a move towards liberal political and economic reforms, aimed at empowering individuals and fostering economic development. In this context, collectivization of the land was seen as a means to reduce inequality between sectors of the population, thereby strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Thus, option B is most closely aligned with Mao's quotation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Du Fu's poem, ""Ballad of the Army Carts,"" describes a harsh reality faced by soldiers stationed in frontier regions during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The poem highlights discontent among the peasantry due to oppressive taxation. This is one of the major causes of later Tang decline, as it contributed to social unrest and weakened the state's ability to maintain order in its vast territories.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of constant warfare and the hardships faced by soldiers suggest that foreign invasions and the need to defend the empire's borders were major contributing factors to the decline of the Tang dynasty. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a foreign invasion of the Tang heartlands.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speech by Mao Zedong discusses the need for peasant cooperation to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. This is a direct response to the growing disparities between rich and poor peasants in China's countryside, which was highlighted in the context of the spontaneous forces of capitalism. The developments described in Mao's speech contributed most directly to the global process of the decline of Soviet-style communism and the rise of Maoism, as it provided a new ideological foundation for the peasants' struggle against the capitalist system.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation of the peasant economy and the focus on collective farming methods directly contributed to the Green Revolution, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity and improve food security through technological advancements and modern farming techniques. As a result, global food prices fell, leading to increased consumption and better living standards for millions of people worldwide. Therefore, the developments described in Mao Zedong's speech regarding the cooperation of the peasant economy are most directly associated with the Green Revolution and development of more efficient agricultural techniques.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that our caravan was now augmented by four hundred slaves, with three hundred being women. This information clearly indicates that these captured slaves were likely to be sold or transported somewhere else for exploitation. Given the context of the excerpt, it is most probable that the destination for these captured slaves would be elites' homes or harems in the Middle East.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high value placed on young women and the brutal treatment of the slaves, it is likely that they were destined for cotton plantations in North America, where slave labor was extensively used in the cotton production process. This was a significant part of the economy during this time.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text provided is from Thucydides, specifically his History of the Peloponnesian War, written around 415 BCE. During this time period, Greece was a democratic state governed by an elected assembly called the Ecclesia (or Council). According to the constitution of Athens, which was adopted in 380 BCE, only adult men who were citizens of the state by birth could participate in the Greek democratic process. This includes voting and being eligible for public office.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the inclusive nature of Athenian democracy, where all adult men and women who were citizens by birth had the right to participate in the political process and contribute to the governance of the state. This principle was established during the time period when this text was written.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker in the second passage, Halima Ghomri, is referring to Algeria's war of independence and its aftermath. She mentions that despite being free, the war is over, they work without fear - but apart from that, nothing has changed. This suggests that the factors contributing to progress during this period were not as significant or visible as hoped for by the speaker. The most likely factor preventing such progress would be hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's disappointment likely stems from the new elites' resistance to women's rights and their reluctance to implement social reforms that would empower women and improve their status in society. This hostility towards women's rights is a common factor among many modern nations, including Algeria during its war of independence. As such, it is likely that the speaker's hopes for progress were prevented by this very same factor.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, is a collective security agreement among the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Iceland. One of its key principles is Article 5, which states that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all. In response to such an attack, each signatory country agrees to assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking action as necessary, including the use of armed force. This concept is most clearly supported by Article 5 and the collective security agreement embodied in the North Atlantic Treaty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, with its emphasis on collective action and mutual aid against threats, aligns with the principles of communism, where nations work together to achieve common goals and defend against external aggression. In contrast, capitalism prioritizes individual profit and self-interest, which is directly opposed to the collective defense and mutual aid principles enshrined in the North Atlantic Treaty.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the shift in foreign states' conditions post-1847, which can be linked to the Meiji Restoration era. This period marked a significant turning point in Japanese history, leading to the unification of Japan under Emperor Meiji.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concerns about foreign advancements and the need for modernization suggest that the era following the passage is the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period marked by Japan's isolationist policies and resistance to external influences. This conclusion aligns with the historical context provided in the passage.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Adolf Hitler was a prominent figure in Nazi Germany during the early 20th century. His condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1 is rooted in his belief that Germany had been unfairly treated at the end of World War I. The Treaty of Versailles, signed by Germany and other victors of World War I, imposed heavy penalties on Germany, including territorial losses, disarmament, and reparations. Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles was a key factor in his rise to power and the eventual establishment of Nazi Germany.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hitler's strong opposition to the Treaty of Versailles was rooted in his belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated and that Germany had a right to reclaim lands lost after World War I. In 1939, Hitler delivered a speech to the Reichstag where he condemned the Treaty of Versailles for its inhumane treatment of Germany. This historical background provides context for Hitler's condemnation of the Treaty of Versailles mentioned in Source 1.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads. This indicates that early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility in combating this foe. Consequently, China devoted its efforts to improving horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe. In other words, China failed to lead in the innovation of gunpowder weaponry because they logically decided to develop weapons better suited to their immediate military needs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese failure to innovate in gunpowder weaponry can be attributed to their overconfidence in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces, leading them to believe that further technological advancements were unnecessary. This belief was reinforced by Confucian traditionalism, which emphasized the importance of maintaining a strong and unified state rather than focusing on constant improvement and innovation. As a result, China did not invest sufficient resources into developing new gunpowder weapons, despite their invention.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the challenges and struggles faced by women, ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups during revolutions. In both cases, the new liberties gained were not without their drawbacks or limitations. For instance, in Olympe de Gouges' Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen (1791), it is mentioned that despite the Revolution's advances, women still faced numerous challenges and restrictions. Similarly, Halima Ghomri's account from the 1970s highlights the persistent struggles faced by Algerian women during their war of independence. In conclusion, both passages indicate that the new liberties gained by revolutions are often not distributed equally or consistently among all groups, including women and ethnic minorities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri experienced disappointment and lack of improvement in their lives after their respective revolutions, which suggests revolutions generally fail to benefit women and minorities. Additionally, both individuals highlight the unequal distribution of new liberties, reinforcing the idea that revolutions often lead to inconsistencies and inequities.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The two passages provided are from Paul of Aegina's 'Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose' (late seventh century C.E.) and Avicenna's 'On Medicine' (ca. 1020 C.E.). Both authors discuss the importance of understanding causes, symptoms, and treatments for health and disease. This cultural exchange that occurred in the period 600\u20131450 C.E. highlights how knowledge from various regions contributed to the development of modern medicine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Aegina and the Mediterranean, which are close to Mesoamerica, indicating a possible influence of Mesoamerican science on European medical practices. Specifically, Paul of Aegina's Epitome discusses fractures of the thigh and nose, which aligns with the medical knowledge from Mesoamerica. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this cultural exchange may have influenced Europeans through systems of trade and navigation.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to Czar Nicholas II's declaration of abdication in Source 1, which is dated March 15, 1917. This event took place during the Russian Revolution and the subsequent period known as the October Revolution.\n\nThe main reason for Czar Nicholas II's decision to abdicate is given by Source 2, where Vladimir Lenin explains that the government was tottering and needed to be given the death-blow at all costs. In other words, the political situation in Russia was dire, and it required a strong leader to restore order and prevent further catastrophe.\n\nTherefore, the best understanding of Czar Nicholas II's declaration of abdication in light of the given information is that it was necessary for him to step down from power due to the dire political situation in Russia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nicholas II mentions the 'happiness of the people,' suggesting that economic prosperity and dissatisfaction with the aristocracy led to his abdication. This aligns closely with choice A, which is the most relevant explanation in light of the provided information.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 provides information about the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, which was established in March 25, 1824. The constitution states that the prevailing dynasty is that of Lord Dom Pedro I, who is the sitting Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil. Additionally, it mentions that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion will continue to be the religion of the Empire. This inference supports option C: 'Religious authority was the basis of the divine right of monarchs to rule their states in the period.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Brazilian constitution mentions a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion as the religion of the Empire, suggesting a connection between religious authority and the divine right of monarchs. This inference is supported by Source 2.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poet discusses 'our America, that has had poets since ancient times, . . . that consulted the stars.' This implies that this particular America has been celebrated for its literary heritage and reverence for astronomical knowledge. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Latin America has excelled in poetry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of consulting the stars and having poets since ancient times suggests that Latin America has a history of scientific inquiry and astronomical knowledge. Furthermore, the poet's emphasis on their American identity, which is described as having had poets, consulted the stars, and lived on various virtues such as light, fire, perfume, and love, indicates that Latin America has been a significant cultural and intellectual hub for centuries. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question regarding the poet's purpose in discussing 'our America' is that it refers to Latin America having excelled in poetry.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote mentions that a Spanish nobleman requires his Indians to provide fruits from their ancestors, which implies a form of economic exchange and cooperation between the two groups. This practice is most likely related to trade or cultural exchanges rather than enslavement or indentured servitude. The closest economic practices mentioned in the options are the encomienda system (option C) and the apprentice system (option D). However, neither of these systems involve the exchange of fruits from ancestors as described in the quote.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The nobleman likely had indigenous people working for him as apprentices, learning agricultural techniques in exchange for food and shelter. This practice of providing young people with an opportunity to learn and grow was known as the apprentice system.\n\nThe phrase 'his Indians' refers to these indigenous individuals who were working under the nobleman's supervision.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses how Christians in Mount Lebanon treat Muslim hermits kindly, while not stopping or hindering Christian merchants in Muslim territories. This suggests that the majority of Muslims during this period were more peaceful and respectful towards Christians than the Christians themselves perceived. Therefore, the first passage supports the traditional historical assumption that the majority of Muslims were more peaceful than Christians during the crusading era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the duty of jihad and the goal of bringing the world under Islamic sway, indicating that many Muslims during the Crusades were inherently violent and driven by their faith to conquer others. This perspective aligns with option C, which states that many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to Mohandas Gandhi's message from Waltair, where he advocated for non-violent resistance. This message resonates with the principles of nonviolent activism that were central to the Indian independence movement. In this context, the most appropriate answer would be the civil rights movements that changed the legal status of minorities in the United States.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance likely inspired the Zionist movement, as they both employed civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve their goals. The Zionist movement aimed to create a modern state of Israel, which was achieved in 1948 after years of struggle against British colonial rule. This historical development exemplifies how Gandhi's principles can inspire positive change and social justice.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Sanehat, a champion from Syria, defied Egyptian ruler during his tent. He was bold and without equal, having vanquished all his rivals. This suggests that the Egyptians were not actively seeking to expand their territories in the Middle East during this period. Instead, they focused on maintaining stability within their own borders and possibly engaging in trade relations with neighboring kingdoms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions a champion of Syria, which suggests a conflict with the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. This is consistent with option C, indicating war with the successor kingdoms of Alexander's empire for hegemony of the Eastern Mediterranean.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided comes from Wu Chengen's Journey to the West, which was written around the 1590s. This work is widely considered an authentic account of Xuanzang's life and journey. However, there are some inconsistencies between this story and historical facts about Xuanzang. For example, the excerpt mentions that Xuanzang had a maternal grandfather who was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. This is not accurate as Yin Kaishan was actually Xuanzang's great-grandfather and not his maternal grandfather. Despite these inconsistencies, the excerpt does not cast doubt on the actual existence of Xuanzang; rather, it highlights some differences between the historical account and the fictionalized version presented in Journey to the West.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt was written centuries after Xuanzang lived, making it unreliable and irrelevant to understanding his actual career. Furthermore, the story of Xuanzang's journey to the West is a popular theme in Chinese literature and history, which has been widely accepted as genuine. Therefore, the most complicating factor for historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career is that it was written centuries after his time.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, who is known for his reforms and contributions to Indian religious practice. Among these changes, we are looking for a significant shift in religion that took place under Ashoka's rule. The provided options do not directly address this change; however, option C seems most relevant as it describes the eradication of traditional Hinduism by armed force. This event occurred during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, which is consistent with the context given in the question.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the self and controlling the mind, which aligns with Ashoka's efforts to eradicate traditional Hinduism and promote Buddhism. Moreover, the passage mentions a chariot metaphor for the mind, further supporting Ashoka's reforms.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the copper and gold mining practices in Mali, particularly focusing on Al-Zawawi's narrative about a sultan who collected tribute from crude copper mines. This information clearly supports the inference that international trade with Sub-Saharan Africa involved the exchange of mineral resources.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the extraction of gold from pits, indicating that Mali possessed advanced mining technologies that contributed to its wealth. Moreover, it mentions that jizya (tax) is collected on crude copper and not on gold or other minerals. This implies that the tax system in Mali was structured in a way that prioritized the exploitation of copper over other mineral resources. However, since the passage does not explicitly state that Mali's advanced mining technologies were solely responsible for its mineral wealth, we cannot conclude with certainty that this inference is supported by the discussion.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poet, Ruben Dario, is known for his political and social commentary in his works. This piece, 'To Roosevelt,' was published in 1904, during a time when the United States was engaged in various international conflicts, including the Spanish-American War. The poem reflects the fears and aspirations of the American people during this period. Given these contextual clues, it is reasonable to conclude that the events prompting the poet to compose this piece were related to U.S. involvement in international conflicts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's themes of resistance against a powerful invader and the mention of 'barbarous soul' suggest it was written in response to the Haitian Revolution and the fight against French colonialism. The poet, Ruben Dario, was born in Haiti and later moved to the United States where he became a prominent figure in the Civil Rights Movement. Therefore, it is highly plausible that this piece of literature was written as a response to the events occurring in Haiti during the time when the poet was living there.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the letter describes incidents such as damage caused by natives encamped near a place, which is likely referring to the Anglo-Zulu War. In this context, it becomes clear that the British government used these incidents to justify their actions during the war. One of the most significant ways they did so was by using these events to legitimize their military campaign against Zulu Kingdom.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The British government used incidents like the one described to justify taxing the Zulu kingdom and demanding reparations for damages caused by their actions. This was done in an effort to compensate the citizens of South Africa who had suffered losses due to the Kingdom of Zulu's involvement in the Anglo-Zulu War. By taxing the Zulu kingdom, the British government sought to ensure that they would receive fair compensation for their actions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph provides us with detailed information about its architectural features, such as the Eanna temple and its magnificent outer walls made of copper. This evidence clearly supports the statement that ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage focuses on the impressive walls and ramparts of Uruk, suggesting that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications and were vulnerable to attacks. This statement is most supported by the discussion of Uruk in the second paragraph.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The song in question, 'Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!', is a seventeenth-century German folk song. These songs often reflect the social and political conditions of their time. In this case, the song criticizes Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, for his actions regarding Bohemia. The narrator's perspective likely aligns with Protestant beliefs, as these were the dominant religious movements in Europe during the seventeenth century.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song criticizes the 'Winter King' for snatching the crown and emphasizes the legitimacy of Ferdinand as the rightful king, suggesting a conflict between Muslims and Christians during this period. Given that the song mentions 'Fritz,' which is a common German first name, it's reasonable to infer that the narrator of the song would most likely identify as Christian.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, is a notable example of colonial territorial disputes between European powers. This treaty specifically deals with the discovery and ownership of lands discovered in the ocean sea up to that date.\n\nThe question asks for evidence supporting which historical development. The provided information directly supports the historical development mentioned in option A: Monarchs were involved in and interested in voyages of discovery. This is evident from the treaty, which was signed by representatives of various European monarchies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty focuses on dividing newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal, which suggests it was related to the trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. This aligns with option C: Trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a situation where British colonial rule in India was challenged by an indigenous uprising against the British authority. This revolt, known as the Cawnpore massacres, resulted in the brutal killing of white men, women, and children. The violence perpetrated during this event is a form of state-sponsored campaigns of genocide, as it was carried out by the British colonial government with the intention of eliminating the indigenous population in favor of the British ruling class.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe violence and massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, suggesting that banditry due to socio-economic breakdown was a significant issue in colonial India. However, none of the given options directly correlate with this form of violence. Banditry could be one consequence of socio-economic disparities, but it is not the primary or only form of violence described in these passages.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage provides information about Mansa Musa, who ruled over a kingdom in present-day West Africa. One key piece of information is that Musa stated that there are no duties levied on goods in his kingdom except for crude copper brought in from mines. This strongly reflects the fact that Mali's wealth came in large part from its exploitation of minerals, specifically copper.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Mansa Musa's control over 'pagan nations' and the slave trade, suggesting that Mali's wealth primarily came from the exploitation of the slave trade. This assertion is most strongly reflected in option D, which states 'Mali's wealth came in large part from the exploitation of the slave trade.'",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade, specifically referring to the 'idolatrous Koholanes.' This implies that there was a belief system or cultural practice that led to the enslavement of these individuals. Therefore, option D: 'All of you [soldiers], are summoned  .  .  . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes' best supports the argument that religion played a role in the Arab slave trade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the capture of a large number of women, indicating that the Arab slave trade was primarily driven by the demand for female slaves for domestic and reproductive purposes. This is further supported by the mention of 'idolatrous Koholanes,' which could be interpreted as a reference to the practice of slavery in Mecca, where idols were worshipped. Therefore, it can be concluded that religion played a significant role in the Arab slave trade.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to two specific constitutions: the Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar in 1819, and the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, March 25, 1824. Both constitutions were created as a result of various factors, including nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism.

Nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism played a significant role in creating these constitutions. These movements sought to unite Latin American nations under a single political and economic framework, promoting the idea of a ""gran colonia"" or ""large colony."" The nationalist leaders, such as Simon Bolivar, believed that by uniting their nations, they could create a stronger and more resilient political system.

In conclusion, the most directly responsible for creating the constitutions mentioned above is nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The documents likely arose from colonial powers guiding their colonies towards self-governance, as they outline frameworks for independent republics. In this case, the constitutions of Gran Colombia and the Empire of Brazil were created by the Spanish colonial powers in response to the desires of the indigenous peoples, provincial elites, nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism, and other factors. Therefore, the most directly responsible for creating these constitutions is the Spanish colonial powers.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The second paragraph discusses non-alignment, which is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. This policy involves foreign investment from capitalist countries but must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue here is not about competing ideologies or empires but rather about co-operation and power dynamics among different nations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation mentioned likely refers to the alliances formed during World War I, where countries with different ideologies collaborated against common enemies. This concept of co-operation was a significant factor in preventing the formation of competing empires and colonization companies.\n\nIn the context of Kwame Nkrumah's Neo-Colonialism (1965), this paragraph discusses how non-aligned countries are based on co-operation with all states, regardless of their economic systems. This policy involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government.\n\nThe issue raised here is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments, but rather the question of power. A state in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny, and this concept of co-operation with all states is a significant factor in preventing such a scenario.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Alfred Crosby, a historian known for his work on ecological imperialism, discusses the factors that contributed to Western European global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 C.E. The most significant factor in this context is geographical and ecological luck. Western Europe exploited the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside their lands. This strategy was facilitated by factors such as the exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe, refinement of gunpowder technologies, development and application of steam-powered technologies, and implementation of joint-stock companies. However, it is important to note that these factors did not contribute equally to Western European global hegemony. Some factors played a more significant role than others.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gunpowder technology was primarily a medieval advancement, so it wouldn't have significantly contributed to European hegemony between 1450 and 1750. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe occurred in the late 16th century, which is well after the period we are considering. The development and application of steam-powered technologies also didn't become widespread until the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century. Lastly, joint-stock companies were established in the early 19th century, but they did not contribute significantly to European global hegemony during the period we are considering.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to classical empires, which are typically characterized by a high degree of cultural homogeneity and political stability. In this context, option A is most relevant as it describes the common practice among these empires where they sought to assimilate conquered peoples into their cultural identity to limit diversity within the empire. This trait was shared by many classical empires such as Rome, Greece, and Persia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Classical empires often supported foreign religions to appease conquered populations and ensure stability within the empire. The Roman Empire, for instance, adopted Christianity as its state religion in 27 AD. This policy allowed Rome to integrate its vast empire more effectively by reducing cultural tensions among different peoples. Therefore, the most classical empires shared a trait of providing state support for foreign religions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt mentions that the king of Ghana, who is a Muslim, adorns himself like a woman and wears necklaces and bracelets. It also states that when people from the same religion as the king approach him, they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads. In contrast, Muslims greet the king only by clapping their hands. This clearly indicates that Islam has a significant influence in Ghana's culture and social structure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Muslim merchants likely adhered to strict religious principles, refusing to engage in trade with individuals outside their faith. This practice would have been influential on the African kingdoms, as it could lead to economic hardship and conflict if not properly managed. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that Muslim merchants refused to do business with anyone who was not Muslim.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The song 'Oh, shame on you, poor Winter King!' refers to Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, who was deposed in 1618 due to his support for the Protestant Reformation. This event is often referred to as the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The song's lyrics reflect Ferdinand's guilt and remorse, urging a young boy named Fritz to seek pardon from his former king. Therefore, the Thirty Years' War inspired the composition of this song.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The song likely refers to the War of Spanish Succession, a conflict over who would inherit the Spanish throne, impacting various European powers. In this context, Ferdinand I Habsburg, also known as the Winter King, was defeated and forced into exile by his brother Charles II. This event inspired the song's lyrics, which depict a sense of shame and dismay for the Winter King due to his actions during the war.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse from the Qur'an discusses the dangers of strong drink, games of chance, and idols. This directly relates to C, as it refers to religious regulation of personal behavior in Islamic society. Now let's consider the second verse which talks about roses blooming and pouring wine. This is related to B, as it discusses production of food and drink in Islamic society. Lastly, the third verse refers to changing gender relations, but since this information isn't mentioned in either verse, we can exclude D from our answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both verses address the production and consumption of food and drink within Islamic societies, highlighting regulations and cultural practices. The first verse refers to Satan's handiwork, suggesting that certain behaviors should be avoided or controlled for the sake of religious purity. The second verse emphasizes the importance of timing and enjoyment in the consumption of wine, reflecting the Islamic belief in moderation and balance in personal behavior.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided describes various aspects of Yuan China, including the presence of Muslims and their treatment in the city of Hangzhou. Ibn Battuta's observations suggest that the Chinese government was actively promoting Islam, which can be seen as evidence for policies of religious toleration. The other options do not seem to align with the excerpt or the historical context provided by Ibn Battuta.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of Muslim communities and their influence suggests that foreigners likely held significant administrative positions in Yuan China. This is supported by the observation of a King of China being a Tartar, indicating that non-Chinese rulers were present. Furthermore, the mention of 'elders' of Islamism and merchants indicates that these individuals had a considerable influence on local communities. In conclusion, the observations expressed in the excerpt are best seen as evidence for policies of religious toleration (A) and instatement of foreigners as provincial administrators (B).",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Marco Polo's Travels describe how the Mongol Empire was different from other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds. One way in which the Mongols were very different is highlighted by option C, which states that 'The Mongols imposed their religious beliefs on the people whom they conquered.' This statement directly contradicts option A, which claims that 'The Mongols generally ignored or assimilated to the cultural identities of the people whom they conquered.' Therefore, option C is the best characterization of one way in which the Mongol Empire was very different from other major empires.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' vast empire and efficient postal system suggest they often took over territory peacefully, establishing order and communication networks. However, the passage mentions that Marco Polo's travels took place during a time when the Mongol Empire was experiencing significant internal conflict and political instability. This suggests that while the Mongols generally maintained their control over conquered territories, they did not always ignore or assimilate to the cultural identities of the people whom they conquered.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the decline of Rome due to immoderate greatness, which eventually led to the fall of the empire. This scenario can be directly applied to other classical empires as well.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD) and the Ottoman Empire (1299-1603 AD) also experienced periods of rapid expansion followed by decline. Both empires faced similar challenges, such as internal strife, external threats, and economic instability.\n\nIn conclusion, the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to the Tang and Ottoman dynasties.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The factors leading to the Roman Empire's decline, such as overexpansion and internal strife, are also applicable to other classical empires like the Qin and Etruscan. However, it's important to note that while these empires faced similar challenges, they did not experience the same level of catastrophic consequences as the Roman Empire did.\n\nIn contrast, the Tang and Ottoman empires also faced similar pressures and challenges during their respective decline periods. The Tang Empire, for instance, was plagued by internal strife, economic instability, and military overspending. Similarly, the Ottoman Empire experienced a series of devastating wars, economic crises, and political instability that ultimately led to its decline.\n\nIn conclusion, while the reasons given in the passage for the fall of the Roman Empire could also be applied to other classical empires like the Tang and Ottoman, it's essential to recognize that these empires faced unique challenges and consequences that set them apart from the Roman Empire.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's writings, Neo-Colonialism (1965), are centered around the critique of neo-colonialism and its impact on Africa. The context provided in the information highlights the struggle against neo-colonialism as a global issue that transcends national boundaries. This aligns with Nkrumah's perspective, which emphasizes the need for collective action to address the root causes of neo-colonialism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writing likely emerged during the Industrial Revolution, as he criticizes the exploitation of less developed nations by industrialized powers. Neo-colonialism refers to a system where colonial powers exploit their colonies for economic and political gain. This context is best suited for Nkrumah's writings on neo-colonialism.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol empire made a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. This indicates an adaptation from the Mongol legacies, specifically religious tolerance.\n\nNow let's compare this with the given options: A) Public libraries - This is not a direct adaptation of Mongol legacies. B) Universal health care - Similarly, this option does not directly reflect an adaptation from Mongol legacies. C) The game of chess - Chess is indeed a popular pastime in many cultures, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to the adaptations of Mongol legacies mentioned in the passage.\n\nFinally, let's look at option D) Religious tolerance: This option directly reflects an adaptation from Mongol legacies. The passage states that virtually all religions were tolerated during the Mongol empire.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. This is supported by Robert Guisepi's observation that 'secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities.' These cities would have been hubs for medical research and development, leading to the spread of advanced health care practices throughout the Mongol Empire's vast territories.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that in kingdom after kingdom, place after place throughout the whole empire, the services of Ahura Mazda and the gods became preeminent. This indicates a strong religious influence on Persian society. Buddhism, being one of the major religions of ancient India, had a significant impact on the cultural landscape of Persia. As Buddhism spread from India to Persia via trade routes and military campaigns, it attracted followers who established Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Persia's location on major trade routes between India and the West likely facilitated the spread of Buddhism and the establishment of Buddhist communities within the empire. The inscription at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, mentions that many divine services were performed in magnificence, indicating a strong religious foundation for Buddhism in Sassanid Persia.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The verse in question is a poem written by Léopold Sédar Senghor, titled 'To New York.' This piece was published in 1956 and reflects the cultural shifts that occurred during this time period. One of these modern cultural developments is the adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors. In this case, Senghor's poem 'To New York' demonstrates a clear understanding of and respect for traditional American literature while also expressing his own unique perspective on the city.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem likely served as a form of political propaganda, advocating for racial equality and social justice within a specific context. In this case, the verse is referencing New York City's reputation as a melting pot of cultures and races, which could be seen as a critique of racial inequality. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be that the verse above is best seen as belonging to the adaptation of Western literary forms by non-Western authors.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's hope for agricultural co-operation in China was to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, which would lead to socialist transformation of agriculture. However, the later development mentioned in option C most undermines these hopes. The cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry, which directly contradicts Mao's vision for agricultural co-operation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. However, this development contradicts Mao's hopes expressed in the passage, as it suggests that co-operation and collectivization could be undermined by political friction.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text refers to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which was established in April 1949. This treaty is aimed at maintaining peace and security in Europe, particularly within the North Atlantic area. It is clear from this context that the treaty is an example of international law and politics.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty likely aimed to maintain the balance of power in Europe by creating a system of alliances and deterring potential aggressors. This treaty, known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), was established on April 4, 1949, with the primary objective of promoting peace, security, and cooperation in Europe and beyond.\n\nThe treaty includes several articles that outline its objectives, principles, and responsibilities. For example, Article 5 states that an armed attack against one or more NATO members in Europe or North America will be considered an attack against them all. In response to such an attack, each member is obligated to assist the party or parties so attacked by taking necessary action, including the use of armed force.\n\nIn conclusion, the treaty provided in the question is most clearly an example of a secret treaty to maintain the balance of power in Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established on April 4, 1949, with the primary objective of promoting peace, security, and cooperation in Europe and beyond.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, which was enacted in response to Chinese laborers coming to the United States endangering local good order. This act led to a suspension of Chinese laborer immigration for ninety days. Another important context is provided by the first passage, which refers to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The cornerstone of this official initiative was the establishment of the White Australia Policy, which aimed to exclude Chinese immigrants from Australia and other parts of the British Empire.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act aimed to diversify the Australian economy by attracting skilled laborers from various European countries and limiting unskilled labor. This act was influenced by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which had been implemented in the United States to prevent the entry of Chinese immigrants who were deemed a threat to public safety and order.\n\nThe first passage provided in the question refers to an Act passed in Australia with similar intentions. The passage mentions that the immigration into the Commonwealth of persons described in any of the following paragraphs is prohibited, particularly those who fail to write out at dictation and sign a passage of fifty words in length in a European language.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that the first passage can be regarded as the cornerstone of the White Australia Policy.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck delivered his speech titled 'The Condition of the Working Class in England and America' in 1884. The main theme of this speech was about the long-term effects of social inequality on the working class, particularly in England and America. In this context, it is clear that the speech does not directly address the development of socialized programs throughout much of Europe or communist overhauls in eastern parts of Germany. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a decrease in German economic output.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's social welfare programs likely led to a decrease in German economic output due to increased taxes and regulations on businesses. However, these measures also had the long-term effect of developing socialized programs throughout much of Europe, which helped alleviate poverty and improve living conditions for many people.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a situation in the 1940s when Bonesteel was making decisions regarding Korean warfare. In this time frame, World War II had already begun and the Soviet Union was actively involved in the conflict on multiple fronts. One of these fronts was the Korean Peninsula, where the Soviets were attempting to establish control over North Korea. Given that Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender zone as far north as he thought the Soviet Union would accept, it is clear that the entry of the Soviet Union into Korea during World War II played a significant role in causing this event.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a consequence of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict with implications for territorial control in Asia. In this context, the United States and its allies were engaged in a struggle against Nazi Germany and its Axis powers. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, was actively supporting the Allied forces in Europe. As a result of these geopolitical dynamics, the Soviet Union would have been compelled to intervene in Korea to protect its interests and maintain its influence in Asia.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839. In this letter, he expressed his concerns about the opium trade in China and its potential negative impact on British interests. He also highlighted the benefits of exporting Chinese products to foreign countries. Based on Lin Zexu' s letter, it is reasonable to conclude that a successful ban of the opium trade in all Chinese territories would have followed his delivery.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter likely aimed to expel all foreigners from Chinese territory due to their involvement in the opium trade and its harmful effects on Chinese society. However, Queen Victoria's response indicates that she did not take such drastic measures against China. Instead, she expressed her desire for better trade relations between the two countries, which led to the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. This treaty effectively ended the First Opium War and established a new era of diplomatic relations between Britain and China.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that from the time the local Yakut and Tungus natives came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. However, none of the given options directly address this issue. Option A talks about rival hunters from China and Japan, which is not related to the native Siberians' tribute obligations. Option B discusses epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers, but again, it does not specifically relate to the natives' difficulties in fulfilling their yasak tributes. Option C talks about general warming of the climate during this time period, which is also unrelated to the native Siberians' challenges with their tribute obligations. Finally, option D mentions reduced demand for furs among European and Asian elites, but it does not address the specific difficulties faced by the natives in fulfilling their yasak tributes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the scarcity of fur-bearing animals, which suggests a change in the environment like global warming that makes it harder for the natives to hunt and pay tribute. However, none of the options provided directly address this issue. Option A talks about rival hunters from China and Japan, but does not explain why this would make fulfilling tribute obligations more difficult. Option B discusses epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers, which could indirectly affect native Siberians' ability to pay tribute. However, it doesn't directly address the issue of reduced fur availability. Option C talks about general warming of the climate during this time period, which could indeed make hunting more difficult and thus increase the burden on natives who have to fulfill their tribute obligations. Option D suggests a reduction in demand for furs among European and Asian elites, but does not directly address the issue of reduced fur availability.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Ming Dynasty of China, under the leadership of Zhengde (r. 1506-1521), allowed merchants to conduct trade missions abroad. This policy change occurred during a time when the Chinese economy was expanding and prosperity was being achieved. The Ming government recognized that foreign trade could contribute significantly to the nation's wealth, and thus, it took steps to encourage this practice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes wealthy merchants with significant influence, suggesting that Confucian principles were relaxed to allow merchants a greater role in government. This change occurred under the Ming Dynasty of China, which was known for its tolerance towards foreign trade and cultural exchange.\n\nIn this case, the most appropriate answer is that the Chinese government abandoned Confucian principles to allow merchants a greater participation in local government.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, who wrote a letter to Queen Victoria in 1839. In this letter, he complains about the British sale of opium in China. Opium is a highly addictive drug that has been prohibited in China for centuries due to its harmful effects on human health and well-being. The passage highlights the importance of respecting local laws and regulations, as well as promoting the welfare of all nations involved in trade relations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the British for introducing a harmful drug to China, and since heroin is a well-known dangerous drug, it's likely the source of the complaint. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, wrote this letter in 1839, shortly after the British had introduced opium to China.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Chinese emperor's response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys, who were seeking expanded trading privileges in 1793. The key takeaway from this context is that European demand for Chinese goods had a significant impact on China's economy and international relations during that time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the influx of silver into China due to European demand for goods, and Portugal's early trade presence likely led to their increased power and prestige. However, these points are not directly related to the British or Japan. The British did shift their focus towards Japan after the Treaty of Amiens in 1895, but this is a later development. Lastly, the passage does not mention any significant shift in trade focus for the British towards Japan.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2 clearly states that the National Organization for Women (NOW) believes that the time has come to move beyond abstract discussions and confront, with concrete action, the conditions preventing women from enjoying equality of opportunity and freedom. This statement directly addresses the question about the women's movement in 1966.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the need to move beyond discussions and symposia, indicating a shift towards more abstract and theoretical explorations of women's issues. However, it also clearly states that the time has come for concrete action, with the ultimate goal being full equality for all segments of society. This suggests that while the women's movement in 1966 was not yet ready for more abstract discussions, it had already started taking concrete steps towards achieving its goals.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a champion of Syria who defies Sanehat, the Egyptian hero mentioned in the question. This suggests that the Tale of Sanehat likely played a significant role in shaping early urban societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt.\n\nThe passage mentions that Sanehat fought with military success, which implies that militarism was a common development in these early urban societies. The mention of his excellence being in his heart, loving him, and knowing his valor further supports the idea that militarism played an important role in shaping these societies.\n\nIn conclusion, the passage most directly supports the development of militarism in early Mesopotamian polities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the speaker's travels and conquests, suggesting the development of extensive trade routes connecting different regions. This is supported by the fact that the speaker mentions 'overcoming all his rivals,' which implies a level of connectivity among various tribes. Furthermore, the mention of 'long distance trade routes' directly supports the development of early urban societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the Arab trade in Africans was different from the Atlantic slave trade. One of the key differences highlighted is that the Atlantic slave trade was motivated by religion, whereas those involved in the Arab trade were driven by economic interests. This distinction makes it clear that the two types of slave trades are fundamentally different.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage refers to the capture of ""idolatrous Koholanes"", implying that the Arab slave trade was driven by religious motivations, unlike the primarily economic Atlantic slave trade. Another key difference is the life expectancy and gender distribution of slaves captured in these two distinct trades. Slaves taken for the Atlantic slave trade were predominantly female, while those taken by Arab merchants were mostly male. Additionally, slaves taken for the Atlantic trade had no prospect of eventual liberty, but slaves taken by Arab merchants did.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the exploitation and suffering faced by indigenous peoples in regions like Siberia, where mining operations have been prevalent for centuries. The first passage highlights three principal reasons why these natives are ruined: 1) forced labor due to the mining industry's need for workers, 2) the destruction of their traditional lands and way of life, and 3) the coercive payment of yasak tribute. The second passage provides a historical context by mentioning Heinrich von F\u00fcch's work on the treatment of natives in Northeast Siberia during the early 18th century. This historical development illustrates how mining operations have contributed to the exploitation and suffering of indigenous peoples, ultimately leading to a broader context of emerging systems of coerced labor.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe systems of forced labor imposed by colonial powers, which aligns with the historical role of joint-stock companies in colonizing overseas territories. The first passage discusses the exploitation of indigenous peoples in Peru and Bolivia, while the second focuses on the treatment of natives in Northeast Siberia under Russian control. Both instances highlight the emergence of systems of coerced labor during this period.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first source mentions that many of the people in Kongo are kidnapped for sale to white men in Portugal. This directly supports conclusion B, as it clearly states that Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese. Now let's examine the other options: A is not supported by any information given. C is also not supported since there is no mention of trade being highly regulated in either source. Lastly, D cannot be confirmed without further evidence or analysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letters highlight concerns about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, suggesting the presence of regulations to control and limit trade interactions between Portugal and Kongo. This information directly supports conclusion B: 'Kongolese noblemen were frequently taken as slaves by the Portuguese.'",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt highlights that English colonial officials in the New World treated native populations with disdain and exploitation. They viewed the natives as mere resources to be extracted for profit, rather than true equals who shared their land and lived under a common rule of law. This attitude was widespread among the colonists, who often did not condone intermingling with the natives or even using them exclusively for harvesting cash crops like tobacco and cotton.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the mistreatment of indigenous people in Spanish colonies, which contrasts with the English experience where conflicts often arose from differing concepts of land ownership. In England, the natives were viewed as true equals as they settled the Americas. This perspective was fundamentally different from that prevalent in the New World during the time period mentioned.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that 'No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace.' Sukarno's reference to these revolutions implies a significant shift in the political landscape, which would have been driven by various causes such as colonialism, imperialism, and economic disparities. In this context, it is most likely that the 'revolutions' referred to by Sukarno were related to decolonization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's reference to ""revolutions"" likely alludes to the communist movements gaining traction in Asia and Africa during the Cold War era. These revolutions were characterized by a radical shift in political ideologies, with the ultimate goal of establishing a socialist or communist state. As such, it is most appropriate to connect Sukarno's reference to 'revolutions' with the cause of B) Communism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech presented above is from Pope Urban II, who addresses a council meeting in Clermont, France, in 1095 CE. This speech emphasizes the importance of Jerusalem and its holy places for Christian soldiers and their ancestors. The pope urges these soldiers to remember the valor of their progenitors and to come to the aid of Jerusalem, which is currently held captive by her enemies. The most direct result of this speech was the inspiration and motivation it provided for Christian soldiers, encouraging them to fight for the reclaiming of Jerusalem and its holy places.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech urges Christians to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, suggesting that this call led to the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks and the restoration of Christian dominance in the Levant. This event is most directly the result of the speech presented above.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The provided information indicates that the city of Ghana consists of two towns, one inhabited by Muslims and the other by pagans. Among the various aspects mentioned, it is clear that the treasury and financial matters are of utmost importance for a ruler. In this context, the most likely explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury would be to facilitate trade with the predominantly Muslim merchants during this era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a Muslim overseeing the treasury, which suggests that the king of Ghana had recently converted to Islam and was incorporating Muslim advisors into his administration. This is because in the context of the eleventh-century, the rulers of Ghana were expected to be devout followers of Islam, as indicated by their title 'al-musulmani'. Therefore, it is most likely that a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury was due to the king's recent conversion to Islam.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided information states that 'They are not modest in the presence of men; they do not veil themselves in spite of their perseverance in the prayers.' This clearly indicates a cultural or religious norm where women do not wear the veil, despite being expected to maintain modesty and respect. The most plausible cause for this practice is that it was a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern. In Islamic societies, such as those in Mali during the 1300s, women were expected to follow strict religious norms and practices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes women as not being modest and not veiling themselves, indicating that they were viewed primarily as sexual objects and had limited control over their own bodies. In Islamic societies, especially those with strict interpretations of the Quran and Sunnah, women's rights were often limited. This is why it was likely that women in Mali did not wear the veil as a form of personal expression or resistance against oppression.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The authors of Source 3 are focused on the Gay Liberation Front's mission to rid society of gender-role systems and to eliminate social pressures on men and women. They acknowledge that achieving this goal is not without obstacles, but one of them they specifically mention as an obstacle to their cause is rigid societal gender roles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the need to eliminate gender roles, suggesting that societal privileging of certain races over others is a key obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation. This idea is further supported by the mention of conflicts with the women's rights movement and the importance of building an alliance with this movement.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first paragraph describes a historical trade pattern between Portuguese traders and Chinese merchants in the late 16th century. This trade involved the exchange of valuable goods such as silk, gold, musk, porcelain, silver, and coins from India. The second paragraph refers to Ralph Fitch's account of his travels to the Far East during the early 17th century. It highlights that by this time, European merchants had already begun to explore new trade routes and markets in Asia. This development directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph because it marked a significant shift in the global economic landscape.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade system where silver flowed from Japan to China, and this pattern was likely disrupted by Enlightenment revolutions that transformed European societies and economies. These revolutions led to increased globalization, competition, and the spread of new ideas about commerce, trade, and international relations. As a result, many traditional trade patterns were undone or significantly altered during this period.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a medieval Islamic society in 'Aden, Yemen. It highlights the pious and generous nature of its inhabitants, who are also known for their wealth and ostentation. This suggests that religious orthodoxy is not the only factor influencing the behavior and character of these people. Instead, other factors such as piety, generosity, and economic prosperity play significant roles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the challenges faced by Aden's inhabitants, including water scarcity and dependence on Arab control, suggesting a hostile environment for outsiders and merchants. Additionally, the passage highlights the piety, humility, generosity, and upright character of the people living there. These attributes are indicative of a society that values religious devotion and community spirit.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Islam spread in Mali during the 1300s, and it provides an account of Ibn Battuta's travels in Mali. The most likely source of Islam in Mali came from contact with Muslim trade caravans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the practice of Islam in Mali, which likely originated from pilgrims traveling to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia and spreading the religion throughout the region. This is supported by option D, as it directly refers to pilgrims who brought Islam to Mali.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The account describes a friendly encounter between Marco Polo and Nicolo, the grand Khan of the Ottoman Empire. This interaction illustrates amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia during the High Middle Ages. In contrast, options A, B, and C do not directly relate to this particular incident.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's positive reception by the Khan, which contradicts the prevailing notion of widespread conflict and lack of cooperation among major political groups during the High Middle Ages. Instead, it highlights a sense of amity and cultural exchange between Europe (represented by the Pope) and Asia (represented by the Mongol Empire).",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt discusses the concept of self-realization and spiritual evolution, which are central tenets of many religious traditions. In this case, it specifically refers to Hindu philosophy, as indicated by the mention of Upanishads from India. The passage highlights the importance of understanding oneself (the 'self' in the chariot) and developing a pure mind (the 'mind') through meditation and self-reflection. By doing so, individuals can ultimately attain spiritual liberation and transcendence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and spiritual growth, suggesting that Hindus should abandon their faith and embrace Buddhism to achieve enlightenment. However, this excerpt does not directly reflect this religious proposition. Instead, it highlights the significance of understanding oneself as a chariot (body) driven by the mind (intellect), and ultimately leading to spiritual evolution through continuous self-reflection.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879 discusses the expanding British presence in South Africa and its direct effects on local communities. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that the British engaged in a war with South African decedents of the Dutch.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference was a significant event in late nineteenth-century European history, where major powers like Great Britain faced consequences for their actions, including territorial losses. In this context, the expanding British presence in South Africa during the late nineteenth century directly led to one of the most significant outcomes of the Berlin Conference: Great Britain was penalized with a loss of land. This is evident from the letter provided, where the author expresses concern about the potential consequences for South Africa if the Queen's enemies destroyed their crops and property.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the French Revolution and its principles, particularly focusing on Maximilien Robespierre's views. Among the given options, the principle of 'The end justifies the means' is most relevant to the context provided in the passage. This principle suggests that an action may be considered morally right if it ultimately leads to a desired outcome.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against enemies of the Republic suggests a belief in the inherent power and authority of the state to enforce its will, regardless of ethical considerations. This principle is closely aligned with the concept of 'The end justifies the means,' which asserts that the ultimate goal or purpose should not be undermined by questionable means. In this context, the French Revolutionary leaders were advocating for a policy of terror as a means to achieve their political goals.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Lin Zexu, a Chinese trade commissioner, writing to Queen Victoria about his concerns regarding opium exports from China. This background fact persuaded Europeans to engage in the actions described in the passage because they recognized the potential harm that such drugs could cause to their own populations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage hints at economic factors driving European actions. Considering the high demand for Chinese tea in Europe, it's likely that rising prices and trade imbalances led to tensions and the opium trade. Additionally, the emperor's insults could have served as a catalyst for European nations to take more aggressive stances against China. However, the passage does not explicitly mention these factors.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955, is a seminal work that discusses the transformation of rural societies in China under the influence of communism. In this text, Mao emphasizes the importance of peasant labor cooperation as a means to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and achieve socialist transformation. This perspective directly reflects the influence of Marxist ideals, particularly those articulated by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their magnum opus, The Communist Manifesto (1848).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's call for agricultural cooperation reflects a trend towards globalized economic models, where collaboration and shared resources are key to achieving prosperity and stability. This influence can be traced back to the ideals of classical liberalism as stated by Adam Smith, who emphasized the importance of free trade and cooperation among nations in order to promote economic growth and development. Mao's view of agricultural co-operation is thus most directly influenced by these classical liberal ideals.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The discussion about Jerusalem and its status as a captive city is centered around the theme of Christian faith and its struggles against heretical beliefs. Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont in 1095 CE reflects this religious context, where he discusses the importance of Jerusalem as a symbol of divine favor and the need for Christians to strive for its liberation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's focus on Jerusalem's importance suggests a connection to the flourishing of religious art during this period, as artists sought to depict and celebrate holy sites. Pope Urban II's discussion of Jerusalem in the third paragraph is best understood in the context of developing religious art.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author discusses a 'second wall,' which refers to the differing views among Catholics and Protestants regarding the interpretation of biblical texts. In Martin Luther's time, this division was primarily due to the Reformation movement, which sought to reform the Church of Rome by removing its heretical teachings and promoting a more direct relationship with God through personal faith.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ""second wall"" likely refers to disagreements between Catholics and Reformers regarding the divinity of Jesus, a central theological point of contention during the Reformation. Catholics believe that Jesus is fully God, while Reformers, such as Martin Luther, argued for a more limited understanding of Jesus' deity.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both sources, Paul of Aegina's Epitome and Avicenna's On Medicine, provide valuable insights into the understanding of human health and disease in different periods of history. In both works, emphasis is placed on the importance of studying the causes (pathogenesis) and symptoms (diagnosis) of diseases. This approach reflects a rationalistic and reason-based understanding of physical phenomena, which contrasts with the supernatural understandings often associated with astrology or other philosophical beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, both sources characterize their understanding of human health and disease as relying upon reason and rationalistic understandings of physical phenomena. This approach contrasts with the supernatural understandings often associated with other philosophical beliefs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages demonstrate a reliance on abstract philosophical principles to understand physical phenomena and guide medical practices, emphasizing theoretical knowledge over empirical observation. In the first passage, Paul of Aegina's Epitome discusses the causes of fractures in the thigh and nose, highlighting the importance of understanding natural anatomy and physiology to effectively treat injuries. In contrast, Ibn Sina's On Medicine emphasizes the importance of studying the causes and beginnings of health and disease, as well as their accidents and accompanying essentials, to develop effective medical practices. Both passages underscore the value of abstract philosophical understandings in guiding scientific inquiry and medical practice.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Chinese emperor rejected strange and costly objects as tribute, indicating a preference for simple goods. Additionally, it states that they set no value on objects strange or ingenious, further suggesting a restriction on foreign trade. Lastly, the passage highlights that the Chinese imposed extraordinary tariffs on all foreign products during this era, which clearly indicates a strong restriction on foreign trade.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During this era, European powers often established exclusive trade agreements with specific regions. Considering the Dutch presence in Asia, it's likely they held exclusive trading rights with China, limiting British involvement. In response to English King George III's diplomatic envoys seeking expanded trading privileges, Chinese emperor responded by stating that he had no interest in strange and costly objects. This statement clearly indicates the Chinese government's restrictive approach towards foreign trade during this era.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther's letter to the Christian nobility of the German nation is a plea for reform within the context of the Reformation movement. The author avoids discussing several topics that are central to the Reformation, such as the wealth of the church (A), the power of the clergy (B), the sale of indulgences (C), and the political nature of the church (D).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's address to the nobility suggests a concern with the political nature of the church and its entanglement with secular authorities, a common issue during the Reformation. However, Martin Luther did not speak about the wealth of the church or the power of the clergy, which are more commonly associated with theological disputes during the Reformation. The topic he avoided speaking about is likely related to the sale of indulgences, as this practice was a significant source of conflict between the Catholic Church and Protestant reformers.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the text, Simón de Bolívar, expresses a belief in the importance of morality and justice as requirements for a properly functioning legal system. In his Message to the Congress of Angostura, 1819, he writes: 'If a people, perverted by their training, succeed in achieving their liberty, they will soon lose it, for it would be of no avail to endeavor to explain to them that happiness consists in the practice of virtue; that the rule of law is more powerful than the rule of tyrants, because, as the laws are more inflexible, every one should submit to their beneficent austerity; that proper morals, and not force, are the bases of law; and that to practice justice is to practice liberty.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bolivar's vision for a just legal system emphasizes the importance of truth and religious values as foundational principles for guiding individual and societal behavior. In this context, morality and justice are not only necessary but also essential components of a properly functioning legal system.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses testimony from a man named Joshua Drake, who was examined before Parliament in the year 1831-32. This context is clearly associated with British history during the Industrial Revolution period. During this time, labor conditions were often harsh and wages were low, as evidenced by Drake's own experiences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The harsh working conditions and child labor described in the passage are likely a consequence of the Scientific Revolution, where new technologies and industrial processes led to changes in labor practices. This period also saw significant advancements in education and social welfare, which may have contributed to the better conditions for children mentioned in the passage.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the city of Ghana consists of two towns, one inhabited by Muslims and another by other communities. Among these communities, it is specifically mentioned that only royalty may wear sewn clothes, while all other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade. This information clearly indicates a distinct social hierarchy within the Ghanaian society, with royalty at the top and common people at the bottom. Furthermore, the passage mentions that the king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. This statement also supports the idea of a distinct social hierarchy within Ghana's society, as it implies that royalty holds significant power and prestige. Based on these points, the most accurate description of the economy of Ghana is option C: 'The king of Ghana taxed salt and copper imports and exports.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details various goods like salt and copper, suggesting a diverse agricultural base and a self-sufficient economy in Ghana, with minimal reliance on external trade. However, the passage also mentions that the king of Ghana taxes salt and copper imports and exports, indicating a more complex economic system involving trade. In conclusion, while option D is the most accurate description based solely on the information provided in the passage, it's important to note that there are elements of complexity in Ghana's economy.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to 'continual beatings' in Joseph Stalin's speech directly supports the decision in later Soviet foreign policy, as it highlights the backwardness and marginalization of Russia during its history. This historical context is crucial for understanding the subsequent decisions made by the Soviet Union regarding its foreign relations. One such decision that can be inferred from Stalin's speech is the creation of the Warsaw Pact, which was formed in 1955 to promote collective security among Eastern Bloc countries. The formation of this alliance was a direct response to the challenges faced by the Soviet Union during its Cold War rivalry with Western powers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's historical analysis of Russia's vulnerability likely influenced the decision to declare war on Japan in 1945, aiming to prevent future threats and assert Soviet strength. The continual beatings that Russia suffered from backwardness and exploitation by capitalist powers would have reinforced Stalin's belief in the necessity of vigilance against potential adversaries.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the Chinese emperor is not interested in strange and costly objects, nor do they have a use for Great Britain's countrymanufactures. This indicates that the Chinese were not primarily interested in expanding trading rights with Great Britain due to their lack of interest in certain types of goods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's response likely reflects underlying political tensions between China and Great Britain, possibly due to British involvement in Chinese foreign affairs or territorial disputes. In this context, the Chinese emperor expresses his lack of interest in expanding trading rights with Great Britain primarily because they have no use for British country's manufactures. This statement effectively communicates China's strategic position and avoids any direct confrontation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, is a notable example of historical developments such as European maritime exploration and the establishment of colonial empires. During this period, Portugal and Castile were engaged in a long-standing dispute over territories discovered in the ocean sea. The treaty provided a peaceful resolution to this controversy by delineating a boundary between Portugal and Spain based on geographical principles. This historical development context is best suited for understanding the treaty of Tordesillas, 1494.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas aligns with the historical context of the African slave trade, where European powers sought to divide territories and control resources, including human labor. In this case, the treaty establishes a boundary between Portugal and Castile, Aragon, etc., based on the discovery of new lands in the ocean sea. This historical development provides the context for understanding the terms and conditions outlined in the Treaty of Tordesillas.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem in question refers to an incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960. To understand the discriminatory system referred to in the poem, we must look at the historical context of apartheid. Apartheid was a system of racial segregation and discrimination that existed in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. It was implemented by the government through various laws and policies, such as banning the teaching of Afrikaans in schools, denying citizenship to people of mixed race, and imposing harsh penalties on those who violated apartheid laws. The discriminatory system referred to in the poem is therefore known as apartheid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's description of racial oppression and segregation aligns with the Jim Crow laws prevalent in the United States during the same era, highlighting the global struggle against racial injustice. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Jim Crow.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Confucius' teachings on filial piety, which is exemplified when parents are served and respected according to proper ritual. This includes their treatment during life and after death. Hence, the ideal that the passage above exemplifies is filial piety.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation, suggesting that even in cases of disobedience, children should seek to restore harmony with their parents through proper rituals. This ideal embodies Confucian teachings on filial piety.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The song describes a Winter King who has been dethroned and is now forced to live in exile. This person, according to the lyrics, has committed a very naughty act - snatching the kaiser's crown from its rightful place. Now, this person faces severe consequences for their actions, including being barred from certain regions and experiencing shame and dismay throughout their days and nights. The question asks about what the Winter King did in response to his situation. Based on the information provided in the song, it is clear that the Winter King did not give over his crown to King Ferdinand; instead, he chose to live in exile and seek forgiveness from his king.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song suggests that the Winter King, recognizing his error in claiming the crown, voluntarily abdicated and returned it to the rightful ruler, King Ferdinand. This act of self-sacrifice and humility aligns with the values portrayed in the song. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the Winter King gave over his crown to King Ferdinand.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Walter Rodney, a historian, argues that Europe's imperialist system is responsible for African underdevelopment. This argument is most likely a response to the colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers during the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. As Rodney points out, these European powers actively extended their exploitation and drained African wealth, making it impossible for Africans to develop rapidly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rodney's analysis likely addresses the impact of New World crops introduced to Africa during this period, leading to economic shifts and potential disruptions to existing agricultural systems. The passage does not explicitly mention colonization or the spread of Christianity; however, these developments are closely related to Rodney's argument about European exploitation and its impact on African underdevelopment.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk, as having been fashioned by the gods with a perfect form. This implies that ancient leaders were highly regarded for their physical appearance and beauty. Furthermore, the passage highlights the divine origins of Gilgamesh, suggesting that these leaders were also considered to have been granted special powers or abilities from the gods.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The detailed description of Gilgamesh's physical form and achievements suggests that ancient leaders were primarily judged based on their appearance and outward accomplishments, rather than internal qualities or moral character. This is evident in the passage when it states that 'the great gods perfected his magnificence beyond all others,' which implies that Gilgamesh's physical attributes were enhanced by divine intervention. In contrast, statements like 'Ancient leaders were expected to be experts of animal husbandry' or 'Ancient leaders were given divine origins to bolster their legitimacy' are not supported by the passage.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Al-Zawawi, a scholar from the Islamic world, spoke about the sultan of Mali and his copper mining activities in Zakar. According to this information, it is clear that trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara played a significant role in spreading Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The king of Mali, facing pressure from the expanding Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, sought alliances with Muslim states to the north, leading to the spread of Islam in Mali. Al-Zawawi's account provides evidence for this scenario as he mentions that the Sultan of Mali told him about a copper mine located in Zakaria (ZKRY), which was brought to Batiy (BYTY). The kingdom of Mali collected duties only on crude copper, indicating that it had trade relations with states to the north. Al' Umari's account from 1300-1384 corroborates this theory as he mentions that Muslim missionaries who came from Southern Africa played a significant role in spreading Islam to the lands of the kingdom of Mali.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh practices towards indigenous peoples, particularly those living in mines. These practices include torture, forced labor, and exploitation of resources without proper compensation or accountability. One significant change mentioned on account of these practices is the replacement of native laborers with an almost exclusively African slave workforce. This practice was a direct result of the colonial policies that prioritized Spanish interests over those of indigenous peoples.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish crown, concerned about the rampant abuses in the colonies, established viceroyalties to exert greater control and ensure better treatment of the indigenous population. However, as described in the passage, these policies did not lead to significant improvements in native rights or conditions.\n\nThe practices outlined in the passage reveal a system that prioritizes profit over human welfare. The Spanish mine owners exploit the labor of poor Indians, subjecting them to harsh punishments and torture. This practice is further exacerbated by the deduction of prices from their labor and workdays.\n\nIn response to these practices, there were no significant changes in Spanish policies towards Native Americans. Instead, as described in the passage, the colonial officials who entered into agreements with the mine owners bribed them to maintain their exploitative practices. This situation highlights the lack of accountability and transparency that characterized the colonial period.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses various aspects of women's lives during the period from approximately 600 BCE to 600 CE. It highlights that women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for their families, which implies a more restricted role in terms of economic responsibilities compared to previous periods. However, it does not explicitly state that women's power fell within the private or public sphere during this time period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As societies became more sedentary and complex, women's roles shifted towards managing the household and raising children, leading to their increased responsibility for childcare. In contrast, in the period from 600 BCE to 600 CE, women's lives were generally more restricted than they had been globally before the advent of sedentary societies. This is evidenced by the fact that women were increasingly thought of as primary earners for the family.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt mentions that Ibn Battuta observed a city in Hangzhou with numerous Muslims, while the Mongol administration in Russian domains during the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. was primarily concerned with maintaining control over their territories.\n\nComparing these two observations, we can see that the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions, including Islamism, while the Mongol administration in Russian domains only tolerated Orthodox Christianity. This difference highlights the distinct cultural and religious contexts of the Mongol empires in China and Russia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol administration in China, similar to its approach in Russia, sought to control trade routes and limit Chinese economic activity to maintain its dominance. This is evident from the comparison between the Mongol administration's policies and those expressed in the excerpt regarding Ibn Battuta's observations of Chinese cities.\n\nIn the context of the excerpt, it states that the Mongol administration in China favored many religious traditions. However, this contradicts the Mongols' policy of controlling trade routes and limiting economic activity to maintain their dominance. This suggests that while the Mongols may have had some influence on Chinese religious practices, they primarily focused on maintaining their political and economic supremacy.\n\nIn summary, compared to the observations expressed in the excerpt regarding Ibn Battuta's travels, Mongol administration of its Russian domains in the period 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. differed by prioritizing trade route control and economic suppression over religious tolerance.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the exploitation and suffering faced by poor Indians due to the mining activities in Huancavelica, among other places. This situation directly contributed to the economic hardship experienced by these communities during the period from approximately 1450 to 1750 C.E.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the vast wealth generated from the mines, Spain no longer needed to invest in risky and expensive voyages of exploration, leading to a decline in such expeditions. This decrease in exploration would have indirectly contributed to a decrease in patronage of religious activities by the monarchs of Spain.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The second letter from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, dated 1512, is particularly interesting because it reflects a significant development in early modern Europe: the desire to explore beyond traditional European waters.\n\nIn this letter, King Manuel expresses his wish for the envoy to fill the ships with either slaves, copper, or ivory. This implies that the king was eager to establish trade relations and possibly colonize new territories in Africa.\n\nThis development is a clear indication of the growing European desire to expand its influence beyond the traditional boundaries of Europe. As a result, various factors such as political alliances, technological advancements, and economic opportunities contributed to this shift in European geopolitics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese crown, driven by a desire to spread Christianity, used commercial ventures as a means to establish Jesuit missions in Africa and other regions. This policy was not only beneficial for the Portuguese but also contributed to the development of European colonialism. In the second letter, King Manuel of Portugal explicitly mentions his wish to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo by filling their ships with slaves or other valuable commodities. This reflects a clear shift in the tone from exploration and trade to exploitation and colonization.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The second paragraph discusses foreign investment from capitalist countries, which is meant to be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of non-aligned States. This policy aims at preventing financial power from being used for impoverishing less developed regions.\n\nThe question asks about the direct result of this foreign investment. The most relevant answer would be option B, as it directly mentions that successful democratic regimes are established in targets of foreign investment. Option A is not directly related to the foreign investment mentioned in the paragraph. Options C and D are irrelevant to the context provided.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Foreign investment from capitalist countries often led to the re-establishment of formal control over former colonies, as investors sought to protect their interests and exert influence. This is most directly reflected in option A, which states that foreign investment would lead to the establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of Martin Luther's Address to the Nobility of the German Nation, 1520, we are discussing the Romanists' beliefs regarding temporal and spiritual powers. The passage mentions that the Romanists affirm and maintain that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but rather that the spiritual power is above the temporal.\n\nThe term 'temporal power' in this context refers to secular or worldly authority. This authority encompasses matters such as governance, law enforcement, economics, education, and religion outside of the realm of faith. In contrast, 'spiritual power' refers to divine authority, which includes matters related to faith, morality, prayer, and spiritual guidance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ""temporal power"" mentioned by Luther refers to the economic and financial influence of the Church, which he saw as corrupt and in need of reform. In a broader context, this temporal power can be understood as a state or secular authority that has been granted certain powers by the Church, such as taxation, monopolies, and military conscription.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, a prominent Ghanaian leader during the early 20th century, criticized neo-colonialism and advocated for non-alignment as a means to prevent capitalist countries from exploiting less developed nations. In his book 'Neo-Colonialism,' Nkrumah emphasizes that national plans should be drawn up by the government of non-aligned states, with their own interests in mind. This idea resonates with classical liberalism, which advocates for self-determination and limited government intervention in matters of domestic policy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's national plan, with its focus on individual liberty and free markets, was heavily inspired by the principles of classical liberalism. This philosophical movement originated in the United States during the late 18th century and emphasized limited government intervention in the economy. Nkrumah's vision for a Ghana that would operate independently while still respecting international norms, can be seen as a direct application of these classical liberal principles.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker refers to the Upanishads, which are sacred texts from Hinduism. These texts discuss various aspects of life, including spirituality and philosophy. Furthermore, the speaker mentions Brahman, a central concept in Hinduism that represents the ultimate reality and essence of existence. Based on these references, it is most likely that the speaker belongs to Hinduism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's reference to a single, universal deity who encompasses all creation aligns with the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism. Furthermore, the Upanishads, which are sacred texts in Hinduism and Buddhism as well, were composed by Indian scholars around 1000 BCE. Given these points, it is most likely that the speaker belongs to the religion of Zoroastrianism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to accounts of Xuanzang's travels from both the 600s and 1500s C.E., which are inspired by his accomplishments. Among these options, option (C) is most relevant as it pertains to Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India. The other options do not align with the historical context provided.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey to India was a secret mission on behalf of the Tang Dynasty to gather intelligence and undermine the Gupta Empire. The accounts from both the 600s and 1500s C.E. are inspired by this accomplishment, as they emphasize Xuanzang's role in espionage.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to a debate that took place in Byzantium during the late eighth century. This period is marked by significant religious changes and shifts, including the rise of iconoclasm and the spread of Christianity among non-Greek populations. The passages provided are excerpts from two sources: John of Damascus's Apologia Against Those Who Decry Holy Images (ca. 730 C.E.) and a decree issued by the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 C.E. Both texts discuss the importance of pictorial representations in preserving religious history and teaching faith to the laity. This debate, therefore, is best understood in the context of disagreement about the appropriate use of religious iconography.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The core issue in the Byzantine iconoclasm controversy was the fundamental nature of divinity and whether it could be accurately represented in images. John of Damascus, a prominent figure during this time, argued that images were essential for memorizing scriptures and fostering spiritual growth among illiterate individuals. In contrast, the Second Council of Nicaea, convened by Emperor Constantine V, declared that images should accurately represent the incarnation of God in order to promote a more realistic understanding of divinity. This disagreement between John of Damascus and the Second Council of Nicaea centered on the appropriate use of religious iconography.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to the journey undertaken by Xuanzang, a monk who traveled extensively throughout China and India during the 600s C.E. His purpose was to fetch Buddhist scriptures from distant lands. This journey is most fruitfully understood in the context of widespread missionary efforts during that time period. The various religious texts, such as sutras and holy books, were being translated into local languages and spread throughout Asia by monks like Xuanzang.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey exemplifies the link between religious syncretism and interregional trade, as he encountered diverse beliefs and facilitated cultural exchange along trade routes. The question specifically mentions that Xuanzang's journeys took place in the 600s C.E., which aligns with the context of widespread missionary efforts during this time period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that these journeys occurred in the context of widespread missionary efforts.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given text is from the Qur'an, Sura 5: 89, which discusses the infamy of Satan's handiwork and encourages leaving such things aside for personal success. This tone clearly reflects a puritanical injunction to adhere to a strict code of conduct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verse's message is a call for obedience to political authority and the maintenance of social order by avoiding vices like strong drink and gambling. This tone best reflects an injunction or a puritanical advice, which are common in religious discourse.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that 'The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness.' This clearly indicates a shift from prosperity to decay, which is characteristic of empires facing their end. Similarly, it states that 'Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.' This passage further supports the idea that an empire's decline is a natural outcome of its immoderate greatness. Therefore, it can be inferred that the decline of the Roman Empire and that of its Chinese counterpart resulted in a shift from prosperity to decay.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of empires led to a greater emphasis on the role of the father as the head of the household, as societies sought stability and order in the face of uncertainty. This shift can be seen in both Roman and Chinese cultures. In the Roman Empire, patriarchal values were promoted through laws and religious texts, while in China, Confucianism emphasized filial piety and respect for authority. Both societies experienced a decline in the rights of women as they became more integrated into their respective households.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from the inscription of Kerdir at Naqsh-e-Rustam, Persia, provides us with information about religions in the period circa 600 B.C.E.\u2013600 C.E. The passage highlights that Ahura Mazda's religion and magi became preeminent across various kingdoms and places within the empire. This indicates a significant degree of religious diversity, as different regions supported distinct belief systems.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that empires during this period were largely areligious, focusing on secular matters rather than promoting any particular faith. This is evident from the excerpt where Kerdir's title 'Ahura Mazda's Chief Priest' reflects his role as a religious official in an empire that prioritized divine worship over political power.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system of labor in which miners from Lima pay for the mita of Indians working in mercury mines. This labor mobilization is not driven by enslavement or plantation monoculture, but rather by economic and political factors such as Spanish colonial rule and the need to extract resources from the region.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Due to ethical concerns and a preference for utilizing local resources, Spain refrained from engaging in the African slave trade and instead relied exclusively on native American labor. This decision led to the development of various forms of labor mobilization, such as the system described in the first passage. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that Spanish authorities adapted local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of ancestor worship in China during the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE). Among various reasons provided, one stands out: 'Former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven.' This statement emphasizes that ancestral virtues are essential for prosperity. The passage also mentions the potential consequences of neglecting ancestor worship, such as 'the ruin of your ancestral temple.' Therefore, this reason supports the importance of ancestor worship in China during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The dire consequences of neglecting ancestor worship, such as the ruin of the ancestral temple, highlight its significance in Chinese society. In this context, the excerpt from the Shu Jing provides a strong argument for the importance of ancestor worship during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE. The various references to the virtues and consequences of ancestor worship emphasize its central role in maintaining social harmony and stability.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'Ballad of the Army Carts' by Du Fu, written around 750 C.E., provides a vivid depiction of Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples. In this context, we can infer that Tang relations relied on adroit diplomacy and establishment of client relationships with bordering nomads (Option A). The ability of the Tang emperor to project military power on the frontier in order to impose his will (Option B) is not directly supported by the poem. Permanent settlement of Han Chinese in frontier zones (Option C) contradicts the information provided in the poem, which highlights the challenges faced by Tang soldiers and their interactions with nomadic peoples living along the borders. The payment of tribute to nomadic rulers (Option D) is also not supported by the poem.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Tang Dynasty ensured peace on its frontiers by paying tribute to powerful nomadic groups, thus avoiding costly conflicts. This practice was not limited to the western regions; it also extended to the eastern frontier. In Du Fu's poem, he vividly describes the harsh realities faced by Tang soldiers in their quest for food and shelter. The poem highlights the challenges faced by Han Chinese settlers living alongside nomadic peoples on the frontier. Based on this information, it is clear that Tang relations with western nomadic peoples and frontier peoples relied on the payment of tribute to nomadic rulers.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck, a prominent politician in the late 19th century, delivered this speech in reaction to Germany's declining life expectancy. This issue was deeply concerning for him as it directly affected the quality of life for his citizens and highlighted the need for urgent reforms. Bismarck likely used this speech to rally support for his policies aimed at improving healthcare, education, and overall living standards in Germany.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's speech was likely a response to the growing problem of child labor in Germany, as he sought to address the exploitation of vulnerable workers. The reference to 'the real grievance of the worker is the insecurity of his existence' further supports this interpretation, as it directly addresses the issue of child labor and its detrimental effects on the well-being of children.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol empire made a vast realm in which once-hostile peoples lived together in peace and virtually all religions were tolerated. This indicates that the Mongols used their power to integrate their vast, geographically diverse area through trade networks. Trade facilitated prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities, which in turn allowed for economic and social development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol khans tolerated virtually all religions, which suggests they might have used a state-sponsored religion to unify their diverse population. However, this option is not explicitly mentioned in the question. Instead, the passage emphasizes the importance of trade networks for integrating the vast Mongol empire. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the Mongol empire used emphasis on trade networks.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the city of Ghana consists of two towns, one with Muslim inhabitants and another with pagan inhabitants. It further states that the people's religion is paganism and they worship idols. This indicates that trade involving goods like salt or copper would have been essential for the economy of Ghana. The passage also mentions that the king levies taxes on these commodities, which implies a direct or indirect role in trade with Asia.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions horses in the Ghanian court, and we know the Mongols were renowned for their use of horses, so this could indicate trade or contact between Ghana and Asia through the Mongol Empire. Additionally, the passage discusses gold and jewels being used by the king, which are common trade goods from regions like India. Lastly, it mentions that the people in his court wore silk robes, which is another typical luxury item traded between different cultures.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the politics in China during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE, particularly focusing on the Shu Jing excerpt. In this context, option A refers to a theme that is not directly mentioned or implied in the passage. Therefore, it does not correctly describe politics in China during the specified period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of the king's wisdom and sagely prowess, suggesting that intelligence was highly valued in Chinese emperors during this period. This aligns with option C, which states that intelligence in a Chinese emperor was valued more highly than ethical behavior. The other options do not directly correspond to the information provided in the passage.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lord Ii's letter refers to a significant change in Japan's condition, specifically the introduction of steamships and radical changes in navigation. These advancements indicate that Japan has modernized its infrastructure and technology. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this event best reflects Lord Ii's concerns.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage expresses concern about foreign states and their advancements, which aligns with the period when Japan adopted Chinese imperial customs and faced pressure to modernize. This event is a reflection of Lord Ii's concerns as it highlights how rapidly Japan was changing and potentially threatening its stability.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, is a notable example of international diplomacy and peace negotiations. This treaty was influenced by various technologies that facilitated the establishment of trust and understanding between different nations. Among these technologies, gunpowder weapons played a significant role in shaping the political landscape of Europe during this period. The invention of gunpowder allowed for the development of more powerful and accurate firearms, which significantly increased the military capabilities of various European powers. As a result, the use of gunpowder weapons led to a series of conflicts and wars between different nations, ultimately contributing to the establishment of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty aimed to divide newly discovered lands, which likely resulted from conflicts and competition fueled by the use of gunpowder weapons during exploration and conquest. Gunpowder weapons enabled faster travel and communication between distant parts of Europe, leading to increased tensions and conflicts among nations. As a result, this technology directly caused the treaty above to be signed.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Dickens and William Wordsworth both had their unique perspectives on the French Revolution. Dickens portrayed it as a period of darkness and despair, while Wordsworth saw it as an opportunity for young people to experience life's beauty and joy. In contrast, these two authors differed in their views about the French Revolution, which can be described by cynical enthusiastic adjectives.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dickens presents contrasting views of the French Revolution, suggesting a sincere attempt to understand and accept both its positive and negative aspects. On the other hand, Wordsworth's perspective is more optimistic and encouraging, celebrating the beauty and youthfulness that come with being alive in such a time as the dawn of human history.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen, written by Olympe de Gouges in 1791 during a French Revolutionary period. This declaration highlights the importance of gender equality and women's rights during revolutions. In particular, it emphasizes that women should be free from slavery, have equal access to education, and enjoy other fundamental human rights. The passage also mentions Halima Ghomri, an Algerian woman who was interviewed in the 1970s after the country's war of independence. Ghomri expresses her disappointment with the lack of progress made towards gender equality during this period. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that revolutionary movements are generally interested in women's rights and strive to promote gender equality.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the call for women's rights during the French Revolution, suggesting that women often take on leadership roles and actively participate in revolutionary movements. Furthermore, it mentions that despite their efforts, women do not always receive the benefits they deserve from these revolutions. However, this does not necessarily mean that revolutionary progressivism does not always concern itself with gender equality. Instead, it indicates that there is still much work to be done in terms of addressing women's rights and ensuring that their voices are heard during times of revolution.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta's journal describes the economic system in 'Aden, Yemen. The key factors that led directly to the development of this economic system are competition with European trade networks and the presence of highly developed port cities like 'Aden. These factors encouraged merchants from various parts of the world to settle in 'Aden, leading to a thriving economy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The journal describes a thriving trade system in Aden, which suggests that the presence of highly developed port cities directly contributed to this economic prosperity. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the presence of highly developed port cities.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two texts provided discuss the afterlife in ancient Sumeria and ancient Egypt, respectively. Text VII from Gilgamesh discusses a dark house where light cannot be seen, whereas The Maxims of Ptahhotep emphasize that those whom the gods guide cannot lose themselves. These contrasting views suggest that ancient Egyptians had a more optimistic and hopeful view of the afterlife compared to ancient Sumerians.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts discuss the role of gods and divine guidance in human life, suggesting that ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had similar patriarchal structures with male deities playing a dominant role. However, these two texts present contrasting views on the afterlife and morality. The text from Tablet VII emphasizes truth's value and its importance in life, while the Maxims of Ptahhotep focus more on the gods' guidance and the consequences of disobedience. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ancient Egyptians had a less gloomy view of the afterlife than ancient Sumerians.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the passage is referring to the concept that prosperity can lead to decay, as well as an increase in destructive causes like conquest. In other words, the more a society becomes wealthy and powerful, the more likely it becomes to succumb to corruption, overextension, or even collapse. This aligns with option C, which states that decay begins the minute something begins to grow.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that prosperity and conquest are incompatible, meaning that as Rome expanded and prospered, it inevitably led to its decline. This is supported by the statement 'the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest.' Conquest often leads to cultural assimilation, political instability, and social unrest, all of which contribute to the decay and eventual fall of Rome.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the dissemination of Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, ca. 415 B.C.E. One of the primary reasons for this widespread cultural exchange is the geography of Greece itself. The passage highlights that Greek culture was not only preserved but also propagated through various means such as oral tradition, written records, and the establishment of colonies. These factors combined with the natural advantages offered by the Mediterranean region, including its fertile soil, abundant water resources, and strategic location, contributed to the successful dissemination of Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean world.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the freedom and ease of life in Greek society, which suggests the presence of fertile river valleys that supported a prosperous agricultural base and allowed for such a lifestyle. This is why option C accurately describes one of the primary reasons that Greek culture was disseminated widely around the Mediterranean region during the time period represented by the passage.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Article 1 of Source 1 asserts that the provinces of Venezuela and New Granada have united to form a single Republic, which is now known as Colombia. This unification implies a strong sense of national identity among the people of these two former Spanish colonies. However, Option A (Intervention by the United States and European powers in the independence of Latin American countries) directly contradicts this expectation. These foreign interventions often lead to political instability and fragmentation within newly independent nations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the unification of Venezuela and New Granada, and we know slave rebellions often led to fragmentation, so this could threaten the unity of Gran Colombia. However, Article 1 of Source 1 explicitly states that 'the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada have all proportions and ways to elevate themselves to a higher grade of power and prosperity.' This implies that while there may be challenges in maintaining unity, these territories are capable of achieving their own goals.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh emerged in ancient Mesopotamia around 2100 BCE. The origins of epic poetry can be traced back to the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities who could record poems. These scribes were often associated with religious practices, and their writings served as important records of historical events, deeds of God-Kings, and mythological stories. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that epic poetry such as the Epic of Gilgamesh originated from the rise of a literate class of scribes in cities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a heroic king and his deeds, suggesting that epic poetry originated from the need to celebrate and record the achievements of a warrior elite. This is most closely aligned with option D: 'The rise of a warrior elite whose deeds were worthy of praise and recording'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the second passage, George Simpson, is a Head of Northern Department at Hudson's Bay Company in 1826. This context suggests that he was interested in trading with local natives for various resources. In this case, the most likely resource the author would have been interested in obtaining from local natives is furs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a desire to control native populations, and ivory was a valuable commodity, so the author likely sought to exploit natives for ivory trade. Ivory is also known as one of the most expensive materials in the world, making it an attractive resource for both wealthy traders and governments.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question refers to two separate historical events: the Kanpur massacres in 1857, and William Howard Russell's My Indian Mutiny Diary from 1860. Both events involved violence against white men, women, and children, which was an essential component of British rule in India. The outcome of both events was a significant escalation of tensions between the British East India Company and the indigenous population, ultimately leading to the revolt of 1857.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a violent rebellion against British rule, which ultimately led to a British victory and a strengthening of the East India Company's control over India. This outcome can be contrasted with the options provided in the question. Option A refers to expulsion and partial home rule for India, which is not directly supported by the passages. Option B correctly identifies the British victory as a result of the rebellion. Option C incorrectly suggests that Indian military success would lead to full independence. Finally, option D incorrectly implies that the defeat of Indian rebels would result in direct rule by the British government.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which significantly influenced immigration patterns in the United States. This act prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the country, leading to a massive influx of Chinese laborers seeking better economic opportunities. Railroad construction was one of the most significant economic activities that drove this rising level of immigration. As railroads expanded and became more efficient, they attracted workers from various industries, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. The demand for labor in these sectors led to an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants seeking employment opportunities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes language skills, which suggests a focus on maintaining high educational standards in a rapidly growing society with increasing immigration. This is particularly relevant to the United States, where English proficiency has been a significant factor in attracting immigrants. Among various economic activities, railroad construction is one that could potentially drive up demand for laborers with strong language skills, thereby contributing to the rise of immigration levels.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the complex relationship between love and fear, as well as the dangers of relying solely on one's relationships for personal security. Machiavelli's treatise is best understood in the context of intense political conflict among warring Italian city-states and other factions. This period marked a time when power struggles were commonplace, and the ability to maintain alliances and form strong bonds with others became increasingly important for survival.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's treatise focuses on maintaining power and control, which suggests it was written during a time of economic prosperity when rulers sought to preserve their wealth and status. This is in contrast to periods of intense political conflict or religious devotion, where the focus would likely be on securing power through diplomacy, alliances, or military might. Therefore, it can be concluded that Machiavelli's treatise was best understood in the context of a time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Joseph Stalin's speech from February 4, 1931, highlighted the continual beatings suffered by old Russia due to her backwardness. This was a significant critique of the Soviet Union's policies during that time. One historical event that can be directly linked to this critique is the German invasion of Russia in 1941. The Nazi regime, which had been allies with Stalin's USSR at the time, invaded and occupied Russia. This event was a direct consequence of Stalin's policies that perpetuated Russia's backwardness and marginalized her from the global stage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin mentions Russia's history of being beaten due to its backwardness, and the Polish-Soviet War was a significant conflict, so this event likely vindicated his efforts to strengthen the nation. The other options do not directly relate to Stalin's advocacy for Russian progress.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that zamindars, who paid revenue to the Mogul, were in a position of dependence. Moreland also discusses how chiefs and tribes sometimes enjoyed practical independence due to inconvenient coercion from the Mogul authorities. This description is most similar to those faced by feudal lords under the Holy Roman Empire, where nobles were dependent on their rulers for protection and revenue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the zamindars' fluctuating relationship with the Mughal throne, which is similar to the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire where lords had varying degrees of autonomy and obligations to the emperor. This comparison highlights that the changes experienced by the zamindars under the Mughal throne were most similar to those faced by feudal lords under the Holy Roman Empire.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the Act to place certain restrictions on Immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants. Among these prohibited immigrants, one category is described as 'any person who when asked to do so by an officer fails to write out at dictation and sign in the presence of the officer a passage of fifty words in length in a European language directed by the officer.' This clearly refers to the exclusion of non-Europeans without referring directly to race.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the passage suggests a desire to ensure that immigrants possessed valuable skills and knowledge that could contribute to the Australian economy. In particular, the mention of European languages indicates an interest in attracting individuals who are proficient in these languages, as they would likely be more competitive in a global marketplace. The passage also mentions the potential for immigrants to become 'charges upon the public,' which could imply that there is a concern for high educational standards in a rapidly growing society.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions that he has recently insured his property for £2,000 and fears that it may not be recovered due to the ongoing conflict between Britain and Zulu natives. This pending litigation with the British government serves as a powerful motivator for the author's actions, highlighting his determination to protect his property and ensure its recovery despite the challenges posed by the war.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions suing the government for damages, which clearly indicates the significant losses he has suffered due to the war. Moreover, this litigation is not only with the British government but also against the Zulus, as indicated by the contingent of 1,500 natives. This suggests that the author's pending litigation serves to blame both his home country and the Zulus for their part in causing these losses.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt provided from Publius Cornelius Tacitus's Germania discusses the brutal conquest and destruction of the Chamavi and Angrivarii tribes by Roman forces. These views are best seen as evidence of disgust for barbarian peoples, which is a common sentiment among Romans towards non-Roman cultures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Roman Empire's ability to witness and benefit from conflicts among barbarian tribes suggests a strong military presence and effective control over the region. This perspective aligns with option A, disgust for barbarian peoples, as it implies that Romans were aware of these conflicts and took them seriously.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The interactions described in the letters involve Portugal's attempts to exploit and control the resources of Kongo, particularly through kidnapping and enslaving people. This behavior is not only unethical but also contrary to Portugal's stated intentions as outlined in the instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512. Therefore, the best understanding of these interactions is within the context of Portuguese exploration of the coast of West Africa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The letters discuss interactions between Portuguese and Kongolese leaders during a time of extensive Portuguese exploration along the West African coast. In particular, these letters address issues related to slave trade, which is evident from the mention of kidnapping noblemen and selling them to white men in Kongo.\n\nGiven this context, it becomes clear that the interactions described in the letters are best understood in the context of a state formation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the Portuguese were actively expanding their influence across West Africa during this period, and they would have been keenly interested in establishing stable political relationships with the indigenous populations.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The comment provided refers to a nobleman's requirement for Indian fruits, which is an indication of the exchange of crops and other food items between Europeans and Native Americans. The Columbian Exchange, which took place during the early 15th century when Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas, played a significant role in this process. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the Columbian Exchange.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the movement of agricultural products between continents, which aligns with the concept of the triangular trade involving Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This exchange led to significant cultural, economic, and political changes across these regions. In this case, the comment quoted above resulted from the triangular trade.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The events depicted in this question are centered around Colonel Bonesteel's decision regarding Japanese forces in Korea during World War II. Bonesteel believed that a surrender zone should be established as far north as the Soviets would accept, which was the 38th parallel. The primary concern of Bonesteel was to prevent Russian forces from seizing all of Korea. If this happened, the United States would not be able to stop them. As a result, Bonesteel decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. This decision had significant consequences for Koreans. The Americans established freedom for all Koreans living north of the 38th parallel, while those living south remained under Japanese rule. As a result, Korea remains divided into two nations near the 38th parallel.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 38th parallel and the surrender of Japanese forces, suggesting that Korea became part of Japan's territory after World War II. However, the question asks about how these events affected Koreans. While it's true that many Koreans were forced to live under Japanese rule, this does not necessarily mean that Korean people became a part of Japan's territory. Instead, it reflects the historical context and the consequences of colonialism.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Kwame Nkrumah's argument regarding African unity and its importance against the world powers' disregard for African Independence. One of the key points made in this context is the inclusion of the Congo in Nkrumah's argument, which serves to highlight the callous disregard of African opposition by the Great Powers. This reasoning leads us to conclude that the passage's intention behind including the Congo in Nkrumah's argument is to blame European powers for the difficulties experienced in Africa.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah highlights the UN's focus on legalities while the Congo faced instability, implying that European powers are responsible for the difficulties experienced in Africa. By including the Congo in his argument, Nkrumah is effectively blaming European powers for the challenges faced by African nations.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther King Jr., in his letter from a Birmingham jail, 1966, endorses nonviolent resistance as a means of achieving his aims. He emphasizes the need for constructive tension to create change and challenge prejudices and racism. This aligns with the broader concept of nonviolent resistance as outlined in the United Nations Charter, which states that 'every individual has the right to take part in the government of his country.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. King emphasizes the need for creating tension and crisis to force negotiation, suggesting a more radical approach like a violent overthrow of the existing power structure.
