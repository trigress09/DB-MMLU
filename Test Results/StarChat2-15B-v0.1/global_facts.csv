C,"Let's reason step by step. In 2019, the United States transitioned from a predominantly fossil fuel-based energy economy to one that relies heavily on renewable sources like wind and solar power. As of this year, about 63% of U.S. electricity came from fossil fuels.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the growing emphasis on renewable energy like solar and wind power, fossil fuels must constitute a smaller portion of electricity generation. According to recent reports, as of 2019, about 43% of U.S. electricity came from fossil fuels.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Russian people who support homosexuality acceptance. As of 2019, a survey conducted by the Levada Center revealed that only 14% of respondents from Russia agreed with this stance. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that approximately 14% of people from Russia support homosexuality acceptance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing global acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, it's likely that a significant portion of the Russian population also supports these rights. As of 2019, a survey conducted by the Levada Center revealed that about 34% of people from Russia say homosexuality should be accepted by society.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as of 2017, approximately 58% of Indians lived in rural areas while the remaining 42% resided in urban areas. Therefore, the percentage of Indians living in urban areas is 42%. This matches option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given India's massive population and rapid economic growth, a majority of its people must be concentrated in urban areas for better opportunities. According to the latest data from the Census of India conducted in 2011, approximately 75% of Indians lived in rural areas. Therefore, the remaining percentage must live in urban areas, which is approximately 25%. As of 2017, this figure has increased to around 60%, indicating a significant shift towards urbanization.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of US adults who believe that criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision making. In 2018, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that approximately 41% of US adults agreed with this statement.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As technology advances, people are generally becoming more comfortable with algorithms making decisions, including in the justice system. A survey from 2018 reveals that about 41% of US adults believe criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision making.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2017, lower respiratory infections were the leading cause of death for children under five years old. This is primarily due to viral illnesses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Preterm birth complications are another significant factor contributing to childhood mortality, but they do not rank among the top causes of death in this age group.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Preterm births are often associated with various health issues and complications, making them a leading cause of death among young children. In addition to preterm birth complications, lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and malaria also contribute significantly to the overall mortality rate in this age group.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Kinsey Report, published in 1948, was a groundbreaking study on human sexuality. It revealed that about 30% of men and 5% of women had experienced homosexual experiences. This information sparked widespread debate and controversy among American society. In 1948, it is estimated that approximately 64% of Americans believed the Kinsey Report to be a bad thing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the social norms and values of the 1940s, a significant portion of the American population likely held conservative views on sexuality and would disapprove of the Kinsey Report. The report was published in 1948 and revealed that nearly half of men had engaged in homosexual acts. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans believed the Kinsey Report to be a bad thing.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Public spending on education is a critical component of global development and progress. As of 2017, the percentage of global GDP allocated to public spending on education was approximately 4%. This figure represents an essential investment in human capital and knowledge.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Education is widely recognized as crucial for economic and social progress, so it's reasonable to assume that countries allocate a substantial portion of their GDP to it. As of 2017, public spending on education globally accounted for approximately 4% of global GDP.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Latin America is a region that spans across South America and includes countries like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, among others. Most of these countries achieved independence shortly after World War II, which marked the end of colonial rule in Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The post-World War II era saw a rise in anti-colonial sentiments and independence movements across the globe, including in Latin America. Most of these countries achieved independence shortly after World War II.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Social Security Act was proposed in 1935 and aimed to provide retirement benefits for workers, their spouses, and children. In order to gauge public opinion on this proposal, various polls were conducted during the early 1930s. Among these surveys, one from the University of Michigan in 1935 found that roughly 70% of Americans were in favor of the Social Security Act.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the economic hardships and social unrest of the Great Depression, it's likely that a significant portion of Americans were skeptical of government intervention and social welfare programs like Social Security. In 1935, however, the U.S. Congress passed the Social Security Act, which was designed to provide retirement benefits for workers and their dependents. The act quickly gained support from a majority of Americans, with estimates suggesting that roughly 70%-90% were in favor of the program.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a recent survey conducted in France, as of 2019, approximately 31% of French people reported that God plays an important role in their life. This figure is higher than the percentages associated with options A (11%) and D (71%). Therefore, option B seems to be the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. France has a strong tradition of secularism and separation of church and state, so it's likely that a relatively small percentage of the population considers God important in their lives. As of 2019, French people reported that about 11% believe God plays an important role in their life.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. GDP per capita is a measure of economic growth that takes into account both inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP). By examining historical data, we can observe the significant increase in China's GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016. Controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, China's GDP per capita increased by approximately 32 fold during this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. China's rapid economic development and industrialization over the past few decades suggest an exponential increase in GDP per capita, likely exceeding 32-fold since 1950. However, it's essential to control for inflation and PPP-adjustment to accurately assess the true growth rate of GDP per capita.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 2014, a study published in the Global Burden of Disease found that about 35% of primary-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school. This statistic highlights the critical need for education and development programs to ensure that all children have access to quality education.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges, including poverty and limited infrastructure, which likely contribute to a high percentage of out-of-school children. In 2014, the World Bank estimated that about 35% of primary-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school. This statistic is consistent with other studies and highlights the urgent need for improved education policies and interventions.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea experienced a remarkable economic growth from 1950 to 2016, despite the challenges posed by inflation and PPP-adjustment. To quantify this growth, we can compare GDP per capita in these two years. According to various sources, GDP per capita increased by approximately 32 fold from 1950 to 2016 in South Korea.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While South Korea has experienced significant economic growth, a 16-fold increase in GDP per capita seems more plausible given the challenges of development and competition in the global market. Inflation and PPP-adjustment have been controlled to provide an accurate comparison between different years.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Americans who agree with a specific statement regarding state governance. According to various polls and surveys, as of 2019, around 61% of Americans agreed that the state is run for the benefit of all people.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing political polarization and media focus on government scandals, it's likely that a smaller portion of Americans believe the state operates for the benefit of all. In 2019, according to various polls, about 31% of Americans agreed with this statement.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank's data, as of 2020, about 35% of Sub-Saharan Africa's population lived on less than $1.90 per day. This percentage is significantly higher than any of the given options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Although Sub-Saharan Africa faces economic challenges, progress in poverty reduction efforts and development initiatives suggests a lower percentage of people living in extreme poverty. According to the World Bank's data for 2020, about 40% of Sub-Saharan African population is living on less than $1.90 per day. This compares favorably with other regions such as South Asia and Latin America.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) released data in 2017 showing that approximately 80% of one-year-old children worldwide had been vaccinated against some disease, such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). This indicates a high level of immunization coverage among young children. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an 80% vaccination rate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While vaccination programs have expanded globally, disparities in access to healthcare and resources likely result in a lower percentage of children receiving vaccinations. As of 2017, the World Health Organization reported that approximately 80% of one-year-old children had been vaccinated against some disease. However, this statistic may vary depending on the specific country or region being considered.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is a common human behavior, especially in developing countries where sanitation facilities may be limited or non-existent. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2020, about 18% of the world population practices open defecation. This statistic highlights the importance of improving global sanitation efforts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is often linked to poverty and lack of sanitation infrastructure, which are more prevalent in developing regions, suggesting a higher percentage of the global population practices it. As of 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 18% of the world's population practices open defecation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Total global healthcare expenditure as of 2017 was estimated to be around $3.4 trillion, while the global GDP at that time was approximately $69.5 trillion. To find out what percentage this represents, we can use the formula: (Healthcare Expenditure / Global GDP) * 100%. Plugging in the numbers, we get: ((3.4 trillion) / (69.5 trillion)) * 100% ≈ 5%. Therefore, total global healthcare expenditure is approximately 5% of global GDP as of 2017.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Healthcare is a fundamental human need, so it's likely that countries allocate a smaller portion of their GDP to it compared to other sectors like education or infrastructure. However, recent years have seen significant growth in global healthcare expenditure due to factors such as increased demand for medical services and advances in technology. As of 2017, total global healthcare expenditure was about 5% of global GDP.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report in 2016, which indicates that approximately 35% of children aged 13-15 in the United States reported being in a physical fight at school, one or more times during the past 12 months. This statistic is based on data collected from schools and parents.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Media reports often highlight instances of school violence, creating a perception that physical fights are more common among teenagers than they actually are. A study published in the Journal of School Violence (2016) found that approximately 15% of children aged 13-15 reported being in a physical fight at school during the past 12 months as of 2015.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Secondary school enrollment rates are a critical indicator of educational development in less developed countries. In 2020, several countries with high secondary-school enrollment were identified: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. These countries have made significant strides in improving access to quality education for their youth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Countries like Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have made strides in economic development and poverty reduction, which often leads to higher investment in education and increased secondary school enrollment. In this case, the most appropriate answer is countries with high secondary-school enrollment: Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the total economic output produced within a country's borders in a given period. As of 2017, the United States spent approximately 6% of its GDP on the military.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has the most powerful military in the world and is involved in numerous conflicts, so it must dedicate a significant portion of its GDP to maintain its military strength. In 2017, the U.S.'s share of GDP spent on the military was estimated at about 6%. This figure indicates that the United States is investing a substantial amount of resources into its national defense.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Solar energy generation has been increasing rapidly worldwide due to advancements in technology and policy support. In 2019, China led the way with a significant increase in solar energy production compared to other countries. This is primarily attributed to the country's vast land area and favorable geographical conditions for solar power generation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is a leader in technological innovation and has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources, so it's likely that they are the top producer of solar energy. However, China also has a significant presence in solar technology due to its rapid economic growth. In 2019, China generated more total energy from solar sources than both the United States and Germany combined.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mental health disorders are a significant concern worldwide, affecting millions of people each year. Among the various mental disorders listed, bipolar disorder is most commonly diagnosed due to its high prevalence in the general population. This makes it an essential consideration when addressing global mental health issues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society, so it's likely the most prevalent mental disorder worldwide. Bipolar disorder, while also a common condition, tends to be less prevalent than schizophrenia due to its more complex nature.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) spent on the military in China as of 2017. To find this information, we would typically look at official government reports or reputable sources that provide up-to-date statistics on national expenditures. In this case, since I don't have access to real-time data, I can only provide a general estimate based on historical trends and common patterns observed in similar countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. China has been rapidly expanding its military capabilities and is becoming a major global power, so it must be spending a substantial portion of its GDP on its military. As of 2017, the share of GDP spent on the military by China was estimated to be around 6%. This figure is significantly higher than any other option provided.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea is a secular country with a strong commitment to freedom of religion. According to the latest survey data from 2019, about 45% of South Koreans say it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.",B,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong history of religious influence on its culture and values, so it's likely that a majority of South Koreans believe in God as a foundation for morality. A survey conducted in 2019 found that approximately 65% of South Koreans said they believed it was necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a report published in 2015, Egypt's Ministry of Education released data showing that approximately 30% of children aged 13-15 reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying may not be as openly discussed or reported in Egyptian culture, so the actual percentage of children experiencing bullying is likely lower than in other countries. However, we can use available data to estimate this figure. In 2015, a study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that approximately 30% of children aged 13-15 reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months. This percentage is likely higher than the actual figure for Egypt.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the percentage of children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. The data provided shows that about 18% of these children reported receiving such punishment. Therefore, this is the most relevant information to answer the question.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In developing countries like Ethiopia, traditional disciplinary methods may still be prevalent, so it's likely that a majority of children experience physical punishment from teachers. According to the given options, the percentage closest to the actual figure would be 38%. However, without access to specific data or studies, we cannot confirm this exact number.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2019, Turks reported that about 69% of them believe God plays an important role in their life. This percentage is slightly higher than the options provided.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Turkey is a secular country with a growing modern society, so the role of religion in people's lives might be less significant than in more traditionally religious countries. However, surveys and studies have shown that about 60% to 70% of Turks say God plays an important role in their life. This percentage is higher than in many other Muslim-majority countries.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank's data, as of 2019, about 8.7% of the world population lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day). This figure is higher than any of the given options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We often hear about extreme poverty in the news and see images of people struggling to survive, so it's likely that a significant portion of the world's population lives in such conditions. In 2019, the United Nations reported that approximately 890 million people or about 14% of the global population lived in extreme poverty. This number is expected to grow as global economic challenges persist.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes annual data on child mortality rates across various countries. In 2017, China had the highest number of children dying under the age of five years, with a staggering 385,469 deaths. This compares to United States with 247,726 deaths, Indonesia with 186,546 deaths, and Pakistan with 170,353 deaths.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Indonesia is a densely populated country with limited access to healthcare in some regions, so it's likely that they have a high number of child deaths under five years old. In contrast, China has implemented extensive programs to improve maternal and newborn care, resulting in a significantly lower mortality rate among children under five years old. The United States and Pakistan also have notable differences in their healthcare systems and child mortality rates.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The median is the middle value when a set of numbers is arranged in ascending or descending order. In this case, we are looking for the median international income as of 2020. Given the options provided, it's clear that the median cannot be $1,000, $10,000, or $30,000 because these values are either too high or too low compared to the middle value in a set of incomes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is $300.",A,"Let's reason step by step. There is a lot of poverty and income inequality in the world, so the median international income is probably closer to what people in developing countries earn. In this case, the most appropriate answer would be below $10,000.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The World Bank's data from 2017 indicates that Brazil had a population of approximately 209 million people. According to the same source, 63% of this population used the internet in the past three months. To find the fraction of the population that used the internet, we can multiply the percentage by 1/100 (or convert it to a decimal). So, 63% * 1/100 = 0.63 or 63%. Therefore, as of 2017, approximately 63% of Brazil's population used the internet in the past three months.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is a large and developing country with increasing access to technology, so it's likely that a majority of the population uses the internet regularly. As of 2017, the World Bank estimated that 58% of the Brazilian population used the internet in the past three months.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement talks about people's optimism towards their own future and the future of their nation or the world. The second statement contradicts this by saying that people are still optimistic about their own future but pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world. Therefore, neither of these pairs of statements can be both true as of 2019.",B,"Let's reason step by step. People generally have a natural tendency towards optimism and hope for the future, so it's likely that they are positive about both their own lives and the future of their nation or the world. In this case, both statements A and B can be considered true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global growth rate refers to the percentage increase in the world's population over a given period of time. In this case, we are comparing the growth rates from 50 years ago (1970) and today (2020). A common misconception is that the growth rate has been four times as high since 1970. However, when we look at the actual data, it turns out that the global growth rate was actually two times as high in 1970 as it is in 2020. This discrepancy arises from the fact that population growth rates have been decreasing over time due to factors such as improved healthcare and education.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, economies were growing at a much faster pace due to post-war recovery and industrialization, so the global growth rate was likely several times higher than it is today. However, factors such as climate change, pandemics, and technological advancements have contributed to recent slower growth rates. Therefore, while option A is true in historical context, option D is more accurate when considering current trends.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. At the time of independence, there were already hundreds of thousands of university graduates in India. However, it is important to note that the quality and diversity of education varied across different regions within India. For instance, while Delhi had a high concentration of educational institutions, other parts of India like Uttar Pradesh or Bihar might have fewer universities but still produced numerous graduates. On the other hand, hardly any university graduates were found in Congo at that time. This is likely due to factors such as political instability, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to education.",A,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong education system and a history of rapid development, so it's likely that they had a significant number of university graduates at the time of their independence. On the other hand, India was still under British colonial rule during this period, which meant that there were hardly any university graduates present in India.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank data, in Niger, the bottom 60% of households consist of the poorest 20%, the next 20%, and the middle 20%. We need to add up their respective income shares: 7.5% (poorest 20%) + 11.8% (next 20%) + 15.5% (middle 20%). The cumulative income share of these households is 44.8%. However, since we are looking for the bottom 60%, we need to subtract this value from 100%: 100% - 44.8% = 55.2%. Therefore, the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households in Niger is 55.2%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 20% of households in Niger account for 15.5% of the income, so this represents the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. To find out the exact percentage, we need to add up the income shares of the poorest 20%, the next 20%, and the middle 20%. This gives us a total of 7.5% + 11.8% + 15.5% = 44.8%. Therefore, the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households in Niger is 44.80%.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Agriculture is a significant sector in the United States economy, contributing to about 4% of GDP in 2015. This percentage has been increasing over time due to factors such as population growth and technological advancements. In this case, the most appropriate answer would be that agriculture made up about 9% of total US GDP.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has extensive agricultural lands and is a major exporter of agricultural products, so agriculture must contribute significantly to its GDP. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that agriculture made up about 20% of total US GDP.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the approval rate for a third presidential term before being reelected. In the 20th century, the United States experienced a shift from a two-party system to one with more parties and ideologies. This led to a decrease in voter turnout and increased polarization among Americans. As a result, it is challenging to accurately determine approval rates for third presidential terms before being reelected. However, based on historical data, we can estimate that around 60% of Americans approved of running a third time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Incumbent presidents often have an advantage in elections, and if they are doing a good job, they are likely to have high approval ratings, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would support a third term. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 60%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to a survey conducted in Tunisia in 2018, about 39% of respondents reported that having an increasing number of people from various races and nationalities makes their country a better place to live.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Tunisia has a relatively homogenous culture, so the impact of increasing diversity on people's perception of their country might not be as significant as in more multicultural societies. However, surveys and opinion polls can provide valuable insights into public attitudes towards various issues. In this case, Tunisians are asked about their feelings regarding the increasing diversity in their country. According to the survey results from 2018, approximately 39% of people from Tunisia say that having an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities makes it a better place to live.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 1943, the United States was still in its formative years as a nation. During this time, there were significant political and social divisions within the country. Among these divisions, one of the most prominent was the ongoing debate regarding the Holocaust. According to a 1943 Gallup poll, approximately 70% of Americans believed in the Holocaust.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Holocaust was a major event during World War II, and information about it was widely disseminated, so it's likely that a majority of Americans were aware of and believed in its occurrence. However, precise figures for the percentage of Americans who believed in the Holocaust are not available.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Redistribution-with-growth policy approach is a strategy that aims to achieve economic growth while also providing social welfare benefits. Some elements of this approach include minimum wage legislation, land reform, and progressive taxation. The element that does not fit into this approach is increased access to education.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Progressive taxation, where higher earners pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes, directly redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, aligning with the goals of redistribution-with-growth policies. The other elements mentioned - minimum wage legislation, land reform, and increased access to education - all contribute to economic growth and social justice, further supporting the redistribution-with-growth policy approach.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis suggests that inequality first increases with development, then decreases as societies become more advanced and interconnected. Most studies to date have supported this hypothesis, indicating that income inequality tends to increase during early stages of development, followed by a decrease as societies evolve.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis, suggesting that inequality initially rises and then falls with development, has been strongly supported by most studies in development economics, making it a widely accepted theory. However, as of 2020, some criticisms have emerged regarding the validity of this hypothesis, particularly concerning its applicability to different regions and contexts.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2018 survey, about 53% of Indians reported that having an increasing number of people from various races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes their country a better place to live. This is compared to other options such as 23%, 38%, and 68%. The closest match among the given choices is option C (53%).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering India's cultural and religious diversity, it's reasonable to assume that a significant portion, around 38%, of the population appreciates the positive impact of a multicultural society. This belief is supported by various studies and surveys conducted in recent years.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children in India who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. To answer this, we need to look at reliable and up-to-date data sources such as government reports or studies published after 2009. Based on these resources, it is estimated that about 38% of children in India reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the traditional hierarchical structures and disciplinary practices often observed in educational settings, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Indian children experience physical punishment from teachers. This is based on the assumption that such practices are widespread and not limited to specific demographic groups.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of US adults who believe computer programs will always reflect human bias. In 2018, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center revealed that approximately 43% of US adults agreed with this statement. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be 43%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the growing awareness of biases in artificial intelligence and the potential for algorithms to perpetuate discrimination, it's plausible that a large majority, around 88%, of US adults believe computer programs will inherently reflect human bias. This belief is likely influenced by various factors, including the increasing prevalence of biased AI systems and the growing public concern about algorithmic fairness.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the number of chickens killed for meat production in 2018. According to various reports, around 690 million chickens were slaughtered worldwide that year. This figure is significantly lower than the options provided. Therefore, we can conclude that option A (690 million) is the most accurate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While global meat consumption is substantial, considering factors like vegetarianism and varying dietary habits, the estimated number of chickens killed for meat production is likely in the billions, around 6.9 billion annually.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The Atom bomb, dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, caused widespread destruction and loss of life. Following the devastation, many Americans began to question their country's role in post-war Japan. In response, some Americans advocated for giving aid to Japan, even at the cost of food shortages. However, it is important to note that not all Americans supported this position. As a result, the exact percentage of Americans who support giving aid to Japan remains uncertain.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the devastation caused by the atomic bombs and the animosity during the war, it's understandable that a minority of Americans, around 33%, would support providing aid to Japan even at the expense of domestic food shortages. This is a clear indication of how deeply ingrained prejudices can be in our society.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2017, approximately 62% of Americans lived in urban areas. This figure is slightly lower than previous years but still remains a significant portion of the population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With the continuous growth of major cities and the decline of rural populations, it's reasonable to assume that a vast majority, around 92%, of Americans reside in urban areas. This statistic is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau as of 2017.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects the African and Caribbean populations. The global HIV/AIDS death rate is highest for individuals who are over 50 years old, due to factors such as advanced age, limited access to healthcare services, and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering that HIV/AIDS is often associated with behaviors prevalent among young adults, it's logical to assume that the 14-May age group experiences the highest death rate from the disease. However, since the question specifically asks for the global HIV/AIDS death rate's highest age group, we must look at data beyond just the 14-May age group. In this case, the most appropriate answer is those over 50.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Access to safe drinking water is a critical human right, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has set ambitious targets for reducing global water-related diseases. As of 2019, about 30% of the global population does not have access to safe drinking water. This statistic highlights the urgent need for increased investment in water infrastructure and sanitation services.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While efforts to improve access to safe drinking water have been made, considering the vastness of the global population and infrastructure limitations, it's plausible that around 20% still lack access to this basic necessity. This figure may vary slightly depending on the source and year.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people in the United States who believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. As of 2019, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that approximately 52% of U.S. adults agreed with this belief. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 52%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the increasing visibility and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States, it's reasonable to assume that a large majority, around 82%, of the population believes homosexuality should be accepted by society. This percentage is likely higher than those mentioned in the provided options.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The richest one percent in the world is determined by their net worth, which includes assets minus liabilities. In 2020, the median net worth of the wealthiest one percent was $153,600. To be among the richest one percent, you would need to make more than this amount annually.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the high cost of living and income disparities, it's plausible that an annual income around $15,000 would place an individual among the richest one percent globally. However, to ensure accurate information, we should refer to credible sources such as Forbes or Bloomberg which regularly update their lists of the world's richest people.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people who believed Nixon should be removed from office before he resigned. Among the given choices, only option C (33%) seems to fit this context as it is a reasonable estimate for such a situation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the severity of the Watergate scandal and the erosion of public trust in Nixon, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Americans believed he should be removed from office before his resignation. This high percentage indicates a strong consensus among the American people regarding Nixon's impending downfall.",B
B,Let's reason step by step. The World Bank's data from 2015 indicates that approximately 81% of the global population over 15 years old was literate. This figure represents a significant increase since the early 20th century when literacy rates were much lower.,A,"Let's reason step by step. While global literacy rates have improved significantly, considering challenges in education access and quality in certain regions, it's plausible that around 81% of the population over 15 years old is literate. This figure is based on data from UNESCO as of 2015.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Life expectancy is a measure of the average number of years that an individual from a specified group is expected to live. In 2019, Iran had the lowest life expectancy among the given countries. This can be attributed to various factors such as political instability, economic hardship, and high rates of infectious diseases.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering Brazil's status as a developing nation with potential challenges in healthcare and socioeconomic conditions, it's reasonable to assume that it has the lowest life expectancy among the listed countries. However, we should verify this claim using reliable data from 2019.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been tracking global suicide rates since 1985. As of 2017, the share of global deaths by suicide is estimated to be around 1.40%. This figure reflects a significant increase from the early 1990s when the rate was less than 0.60%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While suicide is a concerning issue, considering the overall size of the global population and competing causes of death, the share of global deaths by suicide is likely around 0.70%. This figure may vary slightly depending on the source and year of reference.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Germans who believe their relationship with the U.S. is good. According to various surveys and polls, as of 2019, around 49% of German citizens reported feeling this way. This number falls between options B (49%) and C (64%).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the historical ties and cooperation between the United States and Germany, it's reasonable to assume that a majority, around 64%, of Germans perceive the relationship between the two countries as good. This percentage may vary slightly depending on various factors such as political views, personal experiences, and recent events.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people in India who believe political parties are corrupt as of 2013. To find the correct answer, we need to look at the provided choices and compare them with real-world data or historical records.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While corruption is a concern in many political systems, considering India's complex governance structure and occasional scandals, it's plausible that around 66% of the population believes political parties are corrupt. This number may vary depending on various factors such as regional differences or personal biases.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement claims that people in every country believe others are less happy than they actually are. This is a common misconception known as the 'happiness paradox.' However, it's important to note that this belief does not necessarily hold true for all individuals or countries. The second statement talks about women's happiness in the United States. It's true that women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men over time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It's a common observation that people tend to underestimate the happiness of others, and with increasing gender equality, women's happiness has likely risen both in absolute terms and relative to men. However, we cannot definitively say whether these statements are true or false without conducting further research.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global fertility rate refers to the average number of children born per woman during her lifetime. As of 2015, this rate was estimated to be around 1.5 children per woman. This relatively low value indicates a slow population growth and is largely attributed to various factors such as economic constraints, education levels, and cultural attitudes towards family size.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering declining birth rates in many developed countries and increased access to family planning, it's plausible that the global fertility rate is around 1.5 children per woman. This figure aligns with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The World Resources Institute (WRI) released a report in 2015, which stated that about 30% of the world's land area is covered by forests. This percentage varies across different continents and countries. For instance, North America has the highest forested land area at around 45%, while Africa has the lowest at approximately 15%. Therefore, as of 2015, about 30% of the world's land area is forested.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, forests covered a large part of the land. Even if deforestation has increased, forests should still cover a majority of the land area. As of 2015, about 30% of the world's land area is forested.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries between 1960 and 1995. Options A, C, and D provide numerical or historical comparisons that are not relevant to determining the overall growth rate. Option B suggests a comparison with high-income countries, but without specific data, we cannot conclude which group had a higher growth rate. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that there is not enough information to determine the exact growth rate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Less developed countries often struggle with poverty and limited economic opportunities. Therefore, it's likely that their average incomes haven't grown much over time. In this case, the most appropriate answer is an approximately zero growth rate.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The United States experienced a significant economic boom during the post-World War II era, particularly after the establishment of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 1960. However, this period also saw rapid inflation and economic instability. In order to compare GDP per capita across different years, it is essential to adjust for inflation and use a consistent price level. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) introduced the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) methodology in 2011, which provides a more accurate measure of real economic growth. In 2011 prices, GDP per capita in the United States was approximately $37,659. This value is significantly higher than the GDP per capita in 1950 when adjusting for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has experienced substantial economic growth over the years. So, its GDP per capita in 1950 must have been significantly lower than its current level. However, without specific historical data or adjustments for inflation and PPP, it's impossible to provide an exact figure. Nevertheless, considering the general trends in economic development, we can estimate that GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 would have been around $3k when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in Mexico, as of 2017, approximately 31% of respondents reported having paid a bribe to access public services.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in Mexico. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. According to the latest survey data from 2017, about 31% of respondents from Mexico reported having paid a bribe.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) spent on the military in Saudi Arabia as of 2017. To answer this, we need to look at credible and up-to-date data sources. In this case, we can refer to various reports or studies published by reputable organizations such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) or the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defense (MoD). Based on these resources, it is estimated that Saudi Arabia spends about 6% of its GDP on the military.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Saudi Arabia is a wealthy nation, but it also invests in various sectors like infrastructure and social programs. So, its military spending as a share of GDP is likely relatively small. In fact, according to the latest data available up until 2017, Saudi Arabia spent about 6% of its GDP on the military.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In 1987 during the Iran Contra affair, American public opinion was divided on whether President Reagan withheld crucial information about the covert operation involving arms sales to Iran. Among the given choices, 25% is closest to the actual percentage of Americans who believed this at that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ronald Reagan was a popular president with a strong base of support. Even during controversies like Iran Contra, a majority of Americans likely still trusted him. The percentages given in the choices are quite low and far from reflecting the general public's trust in Reagan during this period.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The World Bank's report from 1997 identified that approximately 25% of the world's population lived in low and lower-middle income countries. This information is essential for understanding global development trends and prioritizing resources.,A,"Let's reason step by step. There have been significant efforts to reduce poverty globally. Therefore, the proportion of people living in low-income countries must be relatively small. In 1997, the World Bank reported that approximately 25% of the world's population lived in these conditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a survey conducted in 2019, approximately 59% of Indians reported believing it is necessary to believe in God for moral and value-oriented reasons. This percentage is slightly lower than the other options provided.",A,"Let's reason step by step. India has a rich history of religious and spiritual practices. It's highly likely that almost everyone in India believes in God for moral guidance. However, the exact percentage may vary depending on various factors such as census data collection methods, survey response rates, etc. As of 2019, it's safe to say that a significant majority of Indians believe in God.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In 2015, renewable energy sources accounted for a significant portion of the global electricity generation. Among the given countries, Chile stands out as it invested the largest fraction of its GDP in renewable energy during this year. This is primarily due to Chile's favorable geographical location and abundant natural resources.",C,"Let's reason step by step. India has a massive population and increasing energy needs. It's logical to assume they are investing heavily in renewable energy sources to meet those demands. Chile, on the other hand, is known for its strong commitment to renewable energy development, but it doesn't have as large of an impact on global renewable energy investment compared to India.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in 2013, approximately 48% of Americans agreed that political parties are corrupt. This figure is significantly lower than the percentages provided in options A, C, and D. Therefore, the most accurate answer would be option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has a robust democratic system with checks and balances. Therefore, only a minority of people would perceive political parties as corrupt. In fact, according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2013, less than one-third (36%) of Americans believed that political parties were corrupt.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 20th century was marked by significant global events such as World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. Among these, World War II had the most devastating consequences on human lives. The war resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities, making it one of the deadliest conflicts in history. In this case, the most appropriate answer is World War II.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Wildfires have caused significant damage and loss of life in recent years. Considering their destructive power, they must be responsible for the most deaths in the 20th century. In this case, wildfires are the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a serious global threat that has resulted in numerous fatalities over the years. In 2017, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported that approximately 26,000 people died from terrorism globally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a major global concern, and attacks often result in significant casualties. Therefore, the number of deaths from terrorism must be in the hundreds of thousands. In this case, the most accurate answer would be around 260,000.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. The data provided in 2015 indicates that approximately 16% of children aged 13-15 in Japan reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months. This is significantly higher than the other options.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying is often portrayed as a serious issue in Japanese schools.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese government has been actively combating corruption, particularly in public services. According to a survey conducted by the China Institute of Public Opinion Research (CIPOR) and published by Global Times in 2017, about 46% of respondents from China reported having paid a bribe in the last year to access various public services.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in China. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. A survey conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Justice and the National Bureau of Statistics in 2017 revealed that approximately 46% of respondents from China reported having paid a bribe for public services.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report on school violence in China, as of 2015, approximately 9% of children aged 13-15 reported being involved in physical fights at school.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Chinese culture emphasizes discipline and respect for teachers. Therefore, physical fights in schools are likely rare occurrences. According to the given options, a percentage of children between 13-15 years old in China who reported being in a physical fight at school is 9%. This answer seems most plausible considering the cultural context.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross Perot, a third-party candidate, led the presidential race briefly in June with 39% of the popular vote. Since there are only four choices available and we know that he did not win the election, his percentage must be less than 100%. The closest option to 39% is 1%, but since it's too low, we can eliminate choice A. Now, let's consider the remaining options: B (7%), C (13%), and D (19%). Since Perot did not win with any of these percentages, we can conclude that his actual percentage is somewhere between 1% and 100%, but not equal to 7%, 13%, or 19%. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be 1%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Third-party candidates typically struggle to gain traction in presidential elections. Even with a strong initial showing, Ross Perot likely only secured a small percentage of the popular vote. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 1%.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. GDP per capita is a measure of economic growth that takes into account both inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP). Controlling for these factors, we can observe the relative increase in per capita income over time. In Japan, from 1950 to 2016, GDP per capita increased by approximately 15 fold.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Japan has experienced remarkable economic growth and development since World War II. Its GDP per capita must have increased by at least twentyfold. This is because, after adjusting for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP), the GDP per capita in 1950 was much lower than it is today. Therefore, a twentyfold increase would be an astonishing achievement.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the greatest population growth rate. We are given two options: one from Africa and another from Asia. Both regions have poverty issues, but we need to consider the overall economic growth as well. Option A states that Africa has low overall economic growth, while option D claims that Asia has a steady overall economic growth. Since the question asks for the greatest population growth rate, it is reasonable to assume that this would be in an area with high economic growth. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be Asia's steady overall economic growth.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Africa has the highest population growth rate among world regions. This rapid growth must be driving significant economic progress and development in the continent. However, it is essential to consider that poverty remains a major challenge across Africa. Despite its challenges, Africa's overall economic growth is steadily improving, which contributes significantly to its population growth rate.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people in Ethiopia who believe political parties are corrupt as of 2013. To find the correct answer, we need to look at the provided choices and identify which one aligns with the given information.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

According to a recent survey conducted in 2019, approximately 37% of people from Brazil reported that they believe homosexuality should be accepted by society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is known for its vibrant and inclusive culture, particularly in urban areas, which often leads public opinion on social issues. In this case, the percentage of people from Brazil who say homosexuality should be accepted by society is a matter of public debate. As of 2019, the most recent survey data indicates that about 37% of respondents in Brazil agree with accepting homosexuality.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) released a report in 2016 detailing the number of homeless individuals across the country. According to this data, approximately 55,000 people were experiencing homelessness during that year.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Homelessness primarily affects individuals living on the streets in major cities, and the number seems relatively small compared to the total population.

A,"Let's reason step by step. GDP per capita is a measure of economic growth that takes into account both inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP). By examining historical data, we can estimate the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016 in India. Controlling for inflation and PPP-adjustment, we find that GDP per capita increased by approximately 32 fold over this period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. India has experienced rapid economic expansion in recent decades, with significant advancements in technology and industrialization. To accurately assess the GDP per capita growth, we must control for inflation and PPP-adjustment, as these factors can distort the true picture. According to various studies and reports, India's GDP per capita increased by approximately 8 fold from 1950 to 2016.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The European Union has been actively combating deforestation since the early 1990s. In contrast, Africa and the Americas have seen a more gradual decline in forest cover due to factors such as poverty, climate change, and human encroachment. As of 2015, forests in Europe have increased while those in Africa and the Americas have also increased.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Deforestation is a pressing global issue driven by factors such as agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization. As of 2015, Europe has seen an increase in deforestation since 1990, while Africa and the Americas have also experienced increased deforestation during this period.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a recent survey conducted in Italy, about 41% of respondents believe that free media is very important for their country without government/state censorship.",A,"Let's reason step by step. European countries generally uphold democratic values, including freedom of speech and press, which suggests a high level of support for uncensored media. In Italy, as of 2019, about 56% of respondents indicated that it is very important to have free media in their country without government/state censorship.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Diarrheal diseases are caused by bacterial infections that spread through the digestive tract, leading to dehydration and watery diarrhea. On the other hand, road injuries result from accidents involving vehicles or pedestrians, which can lead to severe physical harm and potentially fatal outcomes. As of 2017, global estimates suggest that diarrheal diseases cause approximately 435 million deaths annually, while road injuries account for approximately 1.39 billion deaths each year.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Road accidents are frequently reported in the news and often result in severe consequences, leading to a perception of high mortality rates. However, when we examine data from various sources (such as the World Health Organization), it becomes clear that diarrheal diseases cause more deaths globally each year. This misconception may arise due to the fact that road accidents are often associated with young people and are not typically reported in the same way as other major causes of death.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. South Sudan is a country in the Horn of Africa, which experienced significant conflict and violence during its civil war from 2013 to 2016. During this time, access to electricity was limited due to infrastructure damage, destruction of power lines, and lack of funding for reconstruction efforts. In 2016, it is estimated that only around 9% of South Sudan's population had access to electricity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With increasing international aid and efforts to improve living standards, access to basic utilities like electricity is likely expanding in developing nations. In South Sudan, which experienced a significant increase in access to electricity from 2013 onwards, we can expect that the percentage of its population with access to electricity would have increased by 2016.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The issue of school desegregation in the U.S. was a significant political debate during the 1950s and 1960s. The Southern states, particularly Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina, were strongly opposed to desegregation due to historical racial segregation. In contrast, the rest of the U.S., including Northern states like California, Illinois, New York, and Texas, favored desegregation as a means to promote social justice and equality. The approximate difference in approval between the South and the rest of the U.S. during this time was around 40%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The South has a history of racial segregation and resistance to civil rights movements, suggesting a significant gap in approval compared to the rest of the U.S. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, school desegration became a major issue that led to increased protests and demonstrations across the South. By the mid-1960s, the South had experienced a significant drop in approval for school desegration compared to the rest of the U.S., with an approximate difference of 80%.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The UN predicts that the global population will continue to grow at an average rate of about 1.1% per year from now until 2100. In 2020, there were approximately 7.8 billion people worldwide. To estimate the number of children in 2100, we need to calculate the total population growth and then subtract the adults (aged 16 years or older). According to the UN's projections, the global population will reach about 9.7 billion by 2100. This means that there will be approximately 1.9 billion people aged between 0 and 15 years old in the year 2100.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As countries develop and provide better healthcare and education, child mortality rates tend to decrease, leading to population growth. The United Nations predicts that the global population will reach approximately 10 billion people in the year 2100. Given this projection, we can estimate that there will be around 2 billion children (aged 0-15 years) in the year 2100.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank's report on Internet usage in India, as of 2017, approximately 39% of the population had used the internet in the past three months. This corresponds to option C (41%) when rounded to the nearest whole number.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Internet penetration is often lower in developing countries with limited infrastructure and economic resources. India, being a developing country, has seen varying internet usage rates over the years. As of 2017, the fraction of the population that used the internet in the past three months was approximately 41%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement claims that as countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. This is a widely accepted idea and has been observed in numerous studies over the years. As of 2020, this statement remains True. The second statement discusses important life events such as marriage or divorce affecting happiness but having surprisingly little long-term impact. While some research suggests that these events may have short-term effects on happiness, it is less clear whether they have a significant long-term impact. As of 2020, this statement remains False.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Happiness is a fleeting emotion influenced by daily experiences and circumstances, while long-term life satisfaction is determined by more stable factors like personality and genetics. The first statement suggests that as countries become richer, people tend to report higher average life satisfaction. This trend has been observed in various studies, but it's important to note that happiness and life satisfaction are not the same thing. The second statement claims that important life events such as marriage or divorce have surprisingly little long-term impact on our happiness. While some research suggests that these events may contribute to temporary happiness fluctuations, there is still debate about their overall effect on happiness and life satisfaction. As of 2020, it's difficult to definitively say whether both statements are true or false.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States experienced a significant economic growth during the late 19th century, known as the Gilded Age. However, measuring GDP per capita in absolute terms can be misleading due to inflation and price level differences between countries. To adjust for these factors, we need to use PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) values in 2011 prices. According to various sources, the GDP per capita in the United States in 1850 was approximately $300 when adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices.",A,"Let's reason step by step.
