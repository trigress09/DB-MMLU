C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the area of the first quadrant region bounded by y = x^2, y = cos(x), and the y-axis, we need to integrate with respect to x over the interval where both curves intersect. First, let's find the intersection points by setting y = x^2 equal to y = cos(x). This gives us a transcendental equation that needs to be solved numerically. Once we have found the intersection points, we can evaluate the integral: ∫[a, b] (cos(x) - x^2) dx, where [a, b] is the interval of intersection. The result will give us the area of the first quadrant region.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The area can be found by integrating the difference between the two curves, from 0 to the point where they intersect, which appears to be around 0.8.

To find the sum of numbers on the faces, we need to consider how these sums contribute to the total sum at the vertices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since each vertex involves three faces, and there are eight vertices, the sum of the numbers on the vertices must be the same as the sum of the numbers on the faces. However, we know that the sum of the numbers on the vertices is equal to $1001$. Therefore, the sum of the numbers written on the faces must also be $1001$.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that Ramanujan and Hardy multiplied their complex numbers to get a product of $32-8i$. Let's denote the number picked by Ramanujan as $R$. So, we have: $R \times (5+3i) = 32-8i$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the product of the two numbers is given and Hardy's number is known, the other number must be the one Hardy picked, which is 5+3i. Now, we can find Ramanujan's number by dividing the product by Hardy's number: (32-8i) / (5+3i). To do this, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 5-3i. After performing these calculations, we find that Ramanujan picked the number 4-4i.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The numbers given are Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers of the form $2^p - 1$. For these two numbers, we have $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$. To find their greatest common divisor (GCD), we can use the fact that if $a$ and $b$ are Mersenne primes, then GCD($a$, $b$) = 1. This is because Mersenne primes have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is:",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the exponents are 1001 and 1012, the greatest common divisor should be the product of these two numbers, which is 2048. However, we must also consider that subtracting 1 from each number results in Mersenne primes. In this case, the greatest common divisor remains 2048 because it's a factor of both numbers.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The points (1,2) and (7,4) are opposite vertices of a square on the Cartesian coordinate plane. To find the length of one side of the square, we can calculate the distance between these two points using the distance formula: $\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Plugging in the coordinates, we get: $\\sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{6^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{36 + 4} = \\sqrt{40}$. Therefore, the length of one side of the square is $\\sqrt{40}$. To find the area of the square, we simply square the length of one side: Area = $(\\sqrt{40})^2 = 40$. Hence, the area of the square is 40.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The distance between the two points is the square root of (7-1)^2 + (4-2)^2, which is the square root of 40. Squaring this gives the area of the square, which is 40.

B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the median time from Sarah's previous five attempts. After sorting the times in ascending order (86, 88, 94, 96, 97), we can see that the median is the middle number, which is 94 seconds. Now, after her sixth attempt, she brings down the median time to 92 seconds. This means that either her sixth attempt was faster than 92 seconds and slower than 94 seconds (which would make it the new median), or her sixth attempt was equal to 92 seconds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To get a median of 92, we need the sum of all six times to be 92 multiplied by 6, which is 552. Adding the sixth time should bring the sum to this value. We can calculate the total time for the first five attempts and then subtract it from 552 to find the sixth attempt's time.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find the probability that five randomly chosen integers between 20 and 69 each have a different tens digit. There are 50 possible choices for each integer (from 20 to 69 inclusive). To ensure all tens digits are unique, we must choose one number from each of the ten available tens digits (0-9 excluding 1). This gives us a total of 10! ways to arrange these numbers. However, since we have already chosen one number for each tens digit, there is only 1 way to arrange them correctly. Therefore, the probability that all five integers have different tens digits is \\frac{1}{10!}.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There are 5 different tens digits from 2 to 6. Choosing any of these for each of the 5 integers gives a probability of 1/4 for each choice, so the total probability is (1/4)^5. Simplifying this expression gives us \\frac{1000}{52969} as our final answer.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms and performing arithmetic operations. For instance, $\\frac{k-3}{2}$ and $\\frac{3k+1}{2}$ are both fractions with a common denominator, so they can be combined into one fraction: $\\frac{(k-3)+(3k+1)}{2}$. Simplifying the numerator gives us $(4k-2)$, which we can rewrite as $2(2k-1)$. Now, our simplified expression looks like this: $\\frac{2(2k-1)}{2} + 3k+1$. Since the denominator is now 2 and it's multiplied by itself in the numerator, we can simplify the fraction to $(2k-1)$. Adding this back to the rest of our expression gives us: $(2k-1) + 3k+1$. Combining like terms, we get $5k$, which is option B. Therefore, the simplified expression equals $5k$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since all terms have a denominator of 2, we can cancel them out. Then, we can combine the k terms and the constant terms to get 3k. Adding this to the remaining constant term gives us 3k + 1.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to understand that a composite number is any positive integer greater than one that has at least one divisor other than one and itself. Now, since we are multiplying the numbers on the faces of 5 dice, it's impossible for us to get a result of 1 (which is neither prime nor composite). So, let's focus on the remaining possibilities: either getting a product that is a prime number or a product that is a composite number. We can calculate the probability of each outcome separately and then add them together to find the overall probability.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The only way to get a prime number as the product is if all five dice show 2, 3, or 5. The probability of this is (3/6)^5, which simplifies to 16/7776. Since we are looking for composite numbers, we subtract the probability of getting a prime from 1: \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{16}{7776} = \\frac{7776}{7776} - \\frac{16}{7776} = \\frac{7760}{7776}.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given that one side is 10 units long, we can eliminate options where the sum of the other two sides is less than or equal to 10. For example, option A (4, 7) and option C (3, 9) cannot be the lengths of the other two sides because their sums are 11 and 12 respectively, which are both less than 10.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. So, the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than 20, which eliminates option D. Now let's check each remaining option: A (4,7) adds up to 11, which is less than 20; B (5,5) adds up to 10, which is equal to the longest side; C (3,9) adds up to 12, which is greater than 20. Therefore, option B could not be the lengths of the other two sides.",B

After finding the solutions, we'll calculate their positive difference.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The difference between the constant terms in the equation is 19 - 12 = 7. Therefore, the positive difference between the solutions must be 7. This is because when we move the constant term to the other side of the equation, it becomes a quadratic expression with roots that are equidistant from each other on the number line.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The expected amount won for playing the game is 50 cents, which means that the probability of winning (drawing a green ball) minus the probability of losing (drawing a purple ball) equals to 0.5 dollars or 50 cents. We can set up an equation as follows: Probability(Green Ball) * Winnings - Probability(Purple Ball) * Losses = Expected Amount Won. Given that there are 5 green balls and $k$ purple balls, the total number of balls is $5 + k$. Therefore, the probability of drawing a green ball is $\frac{5}{5+k}}$, while the probability of drawing a purple ball is $\frac{k}{5+k}}$. Substituting these probabilities into our equation, we get: $\frac{5}{5+k}} * 2 - \frac{k}{5+k}} * (-2) = 0.5$. Simplifying the equation, we find that $k=6$.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The average of winning 2 dollars and losing 2 dollars is 0. To get an expected value of 50 cents, we need an equal number of green and purple balls, so k should be equal to 5. This makes the total number of balls in the bin 10 (5 green + 5 purple), which is a fair distribution.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that F(3) = 8 and F'(3) = -4. The derivative of a function at a point gives us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point. In this case, since F'(3) is negative, we can infer that the graph of F(x) is decreasing in the neighborhood of x = 3. Now, let's estimate F(3.02). Since the function appears to be decreasing, we can expect that F(3.02) will be slightly less than F(3), which is approximately 8. Therefore, an approximate value for F(3.02) would be around 7.98.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since we know the value of the function and its derivative at 3, we can approximate F(3.02) as F(3) + F'(3) * 0.02, which is 8 + (-4) * 0.02 = 8.08.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We are looking for the smallest positive integer $n$ such that all its divisors have a product equal to $n^6$. This implies that $n$ must be a perfect sixth power, i.e., $n = p^6$, where $p$ is a prime number.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the blink intervals for each light: red (2 seconds), yellow (3 seconds), and blue (5 seconds). The LCM will give us the interval at which all lights come on together. By calculating the LCM, we find that it is 30 seconds. Now, let's determine how many times this happens during a seven-minute dance. First, convert the duration of the dance into seconds: 7 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 420 seconds. Next, divide the total duration of the dance by the interval at which all lights come on together: 420 seconds / 30 seconds = 14 times. However, since we are including the very beginning and very end of the dance, we need to add one more time for the first blink after the start of the dance: 14 + 1 = 15 times. Therefore, all the lights will come on at the same time 15 times during a seven-minute dance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The lights blink together every 30 seconds. In a 7-minute (420-second) dance, this will happen 420/30 = 14 times.

This means that if a person named A and B, then either A or B must be telling the truth while the other is lying. Since each person is named in this way by exactly two other people, we can deduce that T (the number of truth-tellers) must be an even number because for every truth-teller, there must be a corresponding liar who names them as one of their liars. The only possible values for T that are even and less than or equal to 11 are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

So, the sum of all possible values of T should be close to 22, making 20 the most likely answer. However, we need to consider that T could also be equal to 6 if one person is always telling the truth and another person is always lying.

The slope of the second line is a/(2*1) = a/2. For these lines to be perpendicular, we have: -1/2 * a/2 = -1 => a^2 = 4 => a = ±2.

Dividing both sides by $6y$ gives us the ratio of $x/y$: $x/y = 2/1$. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the ratio of $2x-y$ to $x+y$ is 2 to 3, then the difference between $2x$ and $y$ is twice the sum of $x$ and $y$.

Now, we need to find the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48. Since each exit is at least 6 km apart, the maximum distance between any two consecutive exits would be exactly 6 km.

In this case, we have a function involving square roots and algebraic expressions under radicals. To find the domain, we need to ensure that the arguments inside the square roots are non-negative (since taking the square root of a negative number is undefined in real numbers). Let's analyze each term separately: 1) $25 - x^2$ must be non-negative for all values of x. This gives us an interval from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. 2) $-(x-2)$ simplifies to $2-x$, which must also be non-negative, giving us another interval from $x = 0$ to $x = 2$.

Now, for each pair of chosen dice, there are exactly three outcomes where both dice show an even number (e.g., both dice showing a '2', or both dice showing a '4', etc.). Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is given by 6 * 3 = 18.

Therefore, we can rewrite 25^1059 as (-8)^1059. Now, observe that every even power of -8 will be a multiple of 64 (since -8^2 = 64), which in turn is congruent to 0 modulo 23. Thus, we only need to consider the remainder when 1059 is divided by 2, since any odd power of -8 will give us a negative number and its equivalent positive remainder modulo 23. Since 1059 is an odd number, we can conclude that (-8)^1059 is congruent to -8 modulo 23.

If it takes 9 days to lose 5 grams, then it will take about 60 days to lose 20 grams, since 9 / 5 = 1.8 and 1.8 * 20 = 36. We can round this up to the nearest day, which is 60.",C

On Tuesday, 22 more bags are delivered, increasing the total to 26 + 22 = 48 bags. On Wednesday, 3 more bags are delivered, reaching a total of 48 + 3 = 51 bags. On Thursday, 11 more bags are delivered, bringing the total to 51 + 11 = 62 bags. Finally, on Friday, 18 more bags are delivered, resulting in a grand total of 62 + 18 = 80 bags of bird feed by the end of the week.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If we add up all the bags delivered each day, we get 17 + 22 + 3 + 11 + 18 = 71 bags. Now, we need to consider the initial number of bags in storage room, which is 9.

Now, our equation becomes $9^{x^2+4x+4}=9^{x+2}$. Since the bases are the same (both are 9), we can equate the exponents. This gives us $(x^2+4x+4)=(x+2)$. Solving this quadratic equation for x, we find that x = -1 or x = 0. The sum of all possible values of x is therefore 0 + (-1) = -1.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Now, we need to check if this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation. Substituting $x=0$ into the original equation gives us $3^{0}=9^2$, which is true.

The play requires one female lead, one male lead, and three different objects that can be played by either gender. To find the number of ways to assign these roles, we need to consider the permutations of choosing one female lead from the four available females, one male lead from the remaining four males, and three unique objects from the eight members (since each object can be played by either gender). The total number of ways is 4! * 4! / (3!) = 24 * 24 / 6 = 1152. However, since there are only eight members in the theater group, we cannot assign three unique objects to them. Therefore, there are no valid ways to assign the roles of the play.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There are 4 choices for the female lead, 4 choices for the male lead, and 8 choices for each of the objects, so the total number of ways is 4 * 4 * 8 * 8 * 8 = 640 ways. However, since the objects can be played by either gender, we need to divide this number by the factorial of the number of objects (3), which gives us 640 / 6 = 106.67. Since we cannot have a fraction of a way, we round up to the nearest whole number, resulting in 107 ways.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The list starts at number 25 and ends at number 100. To find the total count of numbers in this sequence, we can use the formula for an arithmetic series: n = (last term - first term) / common difference + 1. In this case, the last term is 100, the first term is 25, and the common difference is 1 (since each number follows the previous one by a unit increment). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: n = (100 - 25) / 1 + 1 = 75 + 1 = 76. Therefore, there are 76 numbers in the given list.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This can be done using the Pythagorean theorem: $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Plugging in the values gives us $d = \\sqrt{4^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$. Next, we calculate the distance from the origin to $(4,3)$ using the same method: $d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$. Plugging in the values gives us $d = \\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given function is $f(x) = (x+2)^2-5$. To find the domain of this function, we need to ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative. In this case, there are no restrictions on x since $(x+2)^2$ will always be non-negative. Therefore, the domain of $f$ is all real numbers. Now, if we restrict the domain of $f$ to an interval $[c,\\infty)$, then for $x \\geq c$, the expression under the square root becomes $(x-c+2)^2$. This expression will be non-negative for any value of x in the given interval. Thus, by choosing a sufficiently large value for c, we can ensure that the function $f$ has an inverse function on the restricted domain.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The function f(x) is a parabola that opens upwards. To ensure it has an inverse, we need to restrict the domain to where it's increasing, which is after the vertex. The vertex is at x = -2, so the smallest value of c is 3. This ensures that all values in the interval [c, infinity) are greater than -2, thus maintaining the increasing property required for an inverse function.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To create a fraction, we need to consider all possible combinations of the given numbers for both the numerator and denominator. However, since fractions are equivalent if their numerators and denominators are multiplied by the same non-zero number, we must eliminate duplicates. For example, $2/3$ is the same as $4/6$. To find the unique fractions, we can use a method called 'reducing to lowest terms' or simply divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This will ensure that each fraction is in its simplest form. After applying this method, we count the total number of unique fractions that can be made from the given numbers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We have 4 choices for the numerator and 4 choices for the denominator, so we can create 4 * 4 = 16 different fractions. However, since a fraction is unique when both its numerator and denominator are in their simplest form, we must consider that some of these combinations will result in equivalent fractions. For example, $2/3$ and $4/6$ are equivalent fractions. To find the number of unique fractions, we need to divide our initial count by the number of ways we can simplify a fraction (which is 2 for any given fraction). Therefore, the total number of unique numbers that can be made from creating a fraction with the given digits is 16 / 2 = 8.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A relative maximum value occurs when the first derivative of a function changes its sign from positive to negative or vice versa. In this case, we need to find the critical points of the function y = (ln x)/x and then evaluate their corresponding values of y. The critical points are found by setting the first derivative equal to zero: d(y)/dx = 0. After solving for x, we obtain two critical points: x_1 = e and x_2 = 0. Evaluating these critical points in the original function gives us y_1 = 1/e and y_2 = 0. Comparing these values, we find that y_1 is the maximum value of the function within its domain (x > 0). Therefore, the relative maximum value of the function y = (ln x)/x is 1/e.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the function y = (ln x)/x reaches its maximum value when the derivative is equal to zero.

The larger number between the two rolls can range from 2 to 6 (since we are only considering one die). To find the expected value of the larger number, we need to calculate the probability of each outcome and then multiply it by its corresponding value. For example, the probability of rolling a 6 is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36} \\). The expected value for this outcome would be \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\). We need to repeat this process for all possible outcomes and then sum up the results. After performing these calculations, we find that the expected value of the larger number is \\( \\frac{161}{36} \\), which can be simplified to \\( \\frac{161}{6} \\) when expressed as a fraction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We can list all possible outcomes for the larger number: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for the first die and (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for the second die. Adding up all these possibilities gives us 161. To find the expected value, we divide this sum by the total number of outcomes (which is 6 * 6 = 36).

To determine the sum of those three numbers, we need to identify two more such numbers. Upon further inspection, we find that the denominator equals zero when $x = -2$ and $x = -3$.

To solve this, we can use combinations to find the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total possible outcomes when rolling a fair die 5 times. The total possible outcomes are \(6^5\), and the favorable outcomes can be found using combinations: \(C(5,0) + C(5,1) + C(5,2)\). Plugging these values into our formula gives us the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of getting a 6 in one roll is 1/6. So, the probability of getting exactly two 6s in five rolls is (1/6)^2 * (5/6)^3 * 5C2 = 1/648. However, we are interested in getting a 6 at most in two of the rolls. This means that either we get exactly one 6 or no 6s at all. The probability for each case is (1/6) * (5/6)^4 = 25/648 and (5/6)^5 = 625/7776, respectively.

When z = 1/2, x = k * m^2 * (1/2)^6 = 16. Now, we need to find the value of k * m^2 using the given information when z = 2 and x = -16. So, -16 = k * m^2 * (2)^6 = 64k * m^2.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the probability of rain is 30% (or 0.3) and the probability of no rain is 40% (or 0.4). Since these two probabilities must add up to 100%, we can confirm that our initial values are correct. Now, since there is no sun mentioned in the question, we can assume that the occurrence of sun and rain are independent events. Therefore, the probability of both rain and sun occurring would be the product of their individual probabilities: P(rain and sun) = P(rain) * P(sun).

To find the value of $4x^2 + 9y^2$, we can use the identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and substitute $a=2x$ and $b=3y$. This gives us $(2x)^2 + 2(2x)(3y)) + (3y)^2 = 4$. Simplifying, we get $4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 = 4$. Now, substitute the value of $xy$ from the second equation into this equation. This gives us $4x^2 - 60 + 9y^2 = 4$. Finally, rearrange the terms to find the value of $4x^2 + 9y^2$, which is $4x^2 + 9y^2 = 64$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If we square the binomial, we get (2x)^2 + (3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 9y^2. Since (2x + 3y)^2 = 4, then 4x^2 + 9y^2 must also equal 4. Now, we are given that xy = -5. To find the value of 4x^2 + 9y^2, we can use the identity (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 and substitute a with 2x and b with 3y. This gives us (2x - 3y)^2 = 4x^2 - 12xy + 9y^2. Since we know that xy = -5, we can substitute this value into the equation to get (2x - 3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 30y + 9y^2. Now, let's compare this with our original identity 4x^2 + 9y^2 = 4. Since both sides of the equation are equal to 4, we can conclude that 4x^2 + 9y^2 must also be equal to 4. Therefore, the value of 4x^2 + 9y^2 is 4.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the time it takes for half of its atoms to decay into another element or form. In this case, the half-life is 8 years. To find out how long it will take for two thirds of the substance to decay, we can use the formula: Time = ln(1/Fraction left) * Half-life. Plugging in our values, we get: Time = ln(1/(2/3)) * 8 ≈ 4.68 years.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the half-life is 8 years, then it takes 8 years for half of the substance to decay. Therefore, it would take 8 * 2 = 16 years for two-thirds of the substance to decay.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is 16 years.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. To pass the algebra test, Academic Academy requires a score of at least $80\\%$. There are 35 problems on the test. To find out how many problems you can miss and still pass, we need to calculate what percentage of the total problems corresponds to 7 misses (since 7 is the smallest number greater than 0). So, we have: $(35 - 7) / 35 = 28 / 35$. Simplifying this fraction gives us $4 / 5$, which is equivalent to $80\\%$. Therefore, you can miss a maximum of 6 problems and still pass the algebra test.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To pass the test, you need to get at least 80% of the questions right.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a number that satisfies three conditions: (1) when divided by 4, it leaves a remainder of 1; (2) when divided by 3, it leaves a remainder of 1; and (3) when divided by 5, it leaves a remainder of 2. To solve this problem, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or simply check each number starting from the smallest possible one that satisfies all three conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The number must have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 and 3, and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. So, the number is 4 * 3 * 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 63. However, 63 does not satisfy all conditions because it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. Therefore, we need to find the smallest whole number greater than 63 that satisfies all conditions. This can be done by adding multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 3, and 5 until we find the desired number. The LCM of 4, 3, and 5 is 60. So, we add 60 to 63: 63 + 60 = 123. Now, 123 satisfies all conditions because it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4 (123 = 4 * 30 + 3), a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (123 = 3 * 41), and a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 (123 = 5 * 24 + 3).",A

To find the maximum value of this function, we can use calculus techniques such as finding critical points or using the first derivative test. In this case, it's easier to notice that the function f(x) = xe^{-x} will approach zero as x goes to infinity. This means that there must be a point where the function reaches its maximum value. Using numerical methods or graphing tools, we can approximate the maximum value of the function to be approximately 1/e.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The function f(x) = xe^(-x) has a maximum value when x = 1, because at this point the linear term x is at its highest while the exponential term e^(-x) is still relatively close to 1.

We repeat this process until we have found all the integers within the range that satisfy the condition. In this case, there are 30 such integers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. There are 15 positive integers less than 200 that are congruent to 5 modulo 13. Therefore, there must be 15 * 2 = 30 integers between -200 and 200 that are congruent to 5 modulo 13. The negative integers can be obtained by multiplying the positive integers by -1.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. We need to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, ensuring all three are of different suits. First, we select one suit out of the four available (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Once we've chosen our first suit, there will be 13 remaining cards in that suit. Next, we need to choose a second suit from the remaining three options. After selecting the second suit, there will be another 13 remaining cards in that suit. Finally, for our third card, we must select a card from one of the remaining two suits. There are 13 cards left in each of these suits. To find the total number of ways to choose 3 cards with all three being of different suits, we multiply the number of choices for each step: 4 (suits) * 13 (cards in first suit) * 12 (remaining cards in second suit) * 11 (remaining cards in third suit).",A,"Let's reason step by step. There are 13 ways to choose one card from each suit. Since we need to choose 3 cards from different suits, there are 13^3 = 2197 ways to do this. However, since the order of the cards does not matter, we must divide our result by 3! = 6. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 3 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, if all three cards must be of different suits, is (2197/6) ≈ 366.17.",C

C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the rate at which Rowena and Ruby can paint a room individually. Rowena can paint in 14 hours, so her rate is 1/14 of the room per hour. Ruby can paint in 6 hours, so her rate is 1/6 of the room per hour. Now, let's consider the two scenarios given: if Rowena paints for x hours and Ruby paints for y hours, they finish half of the painting; if Rowena paints for y hours and Ruby paints for x hours, they paint the whole room. From these scenarios, we can set up equations based on their rates: (1/14)x + (1/6)y = 1/2 and (1/14)y + (1/6)x = 1. Solving this system of linear equations will give us the values of x and y.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Rowena and Ruby paint for the same amount of time, they should complete the same portion of the painting. So, x and y should be equal, resulting in the ordered pair (11/10, 11/10).

This equation has two possible solutions: one where $(x-4) = 12$ and another where $(x-4) = -12$. Solving these equations gives us $x=16$ and $x=-8$, respectively. Now, we need to find the product of all possible values of $x$. Multiplying $16$ by $-8$ gives us $-128$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Solving the equation, we get |x-4| = 12, which means x-4 = 12.

The equation log_b(343) = -3/2 means that b^(-3/2) = 343. Since 7^3 = 343, then b must be equal to 7.

When delivering these packages randomly, we need to find the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses. To do this, we can use combinations to calculate the number of ways to choose which two packages will be delivered correctly. There are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose two packages out of four. Next, we need to consider the number of ways these two chosen packages can be delivered correctly. This is simply C(4,1) * C(3,1) = 4 * 3 = 12 ways. Finally, we multiply the number of ways to choose the correct packages by the number of ways to deliver them correctly: 6 * 12 = 72. The total number of possible outcomes when delivering the packages randomly is C(8,4) = 70. Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the packages are delivered to the correct houses is P(exactly two correct) = 72/70 = \\frac{36}{35}.",D,"Let's reason step by step. There are 4! = 24 ways to deliver the packages. Out of these, there are several ways for two packages to be delivered correctly, such as (1,2,4,3) and (1,3,2,4).

To do this, we can use combinations: there are C(4,2) = 6 ways to choose which two houses will receive correct packages. For each of these choices, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange the correct packages among themselves. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is 6 * 2 = 12.

The given circle equation represents an ellipse with a vertical major axis since the coefficient of $x^2$ is negative and twice as large in absolute value compared to the coefficient of $y^2$. This ellipse is also centered at $(3, -1)$ because the x-coordinate term has a positive coefficient and the y-coordinate term has a negative coefficient.

The equation $2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20$ can be simplified into $(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 10$, which gives a radius of $\sqrt{10}$ and a diameter of $2\sqrt{10}$. The circle is inscribed inside a square, so the diagonal of the square must be equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the side length of the square is $2\sqrt{10}$.

In order to maximize the value of the expression, we need to maximize each of the factors. Since $x$ can be any real number, we can make $(x+7)$ as large as we want and $(2-x)$ as small as we want. To maximize $(4(x+7)(2-x)))$, we should choose $x = -7/3$ (which makes $(x+7) = 0$) to maximize the product of $(2-x)$ and $(x+7)$.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the function f(x) is strictly convex and passes through points (-2,5) and (2,9). A strictly convex function has a unique global minimum point. Since our function goes through two points, it must have a local minimum somewhere between these two points. However, since we are looking for the range of all possible values for f(1), we need to consider both the local minimum and the global minimum. The line segment connecting (-2,5) and (2,9) has a slope of 2. Therefore, the y-coordinate of any point on this line segment will be between 5 and 9. This means that the range of all possible values for f(1) must include at least the interval [5, 9]. However, since we are looking for the global minimum, which is a unique value, it cannot be strictly within the interval [5, 9]. Therefore, the range of all possible values for f(1) must be an interval that includes [5, 9] and possibly extends beyond this interval.

To find the range of all possible values for $f(1)$, we can simply take the average of $f(-2)$ and $f(2)$, which are 5 and 9 respectively.

Now, let's consider the expression $z^3 + z^2 + z = (a + bi)^3 + (a + bi)^2 + (a + bi)$. Expanding this expression and comparing the imaginary parts, we find that $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 3ab - a^3 - 3a^2b + ab^2 + a^2b^2$. Since we know that $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 0$, we can set the above expression equal to zero and solve for $b$ in terms of $a$. Simplifying this equation, we find that $b(3a - a^3) = 0$. This implies that either $b = 0$ or $3a - a^3 = 0$.

Now, we need to find the value of c such that the tangent line at point (c, f(c)) is parallel to this secant line.

The tangent line to the graph of $f(x) = e^x - x^2$ at a point $(c, f(c))$ is parallel to the secant line if and only if their slopes are equal.

We know that $(a^b)^c = a^{b\cdot c}$, so $(4^3)^3 = 4^{3\cdot3} = 4^9$. Now we have $\\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^9)} = \\frac{4^{27}}}{4^9}$. When dividing powers with the same base, we subtract their exponents. So, $4^{27-9} = 4^{18}$. Finally, we have $4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{2\cdot18} = 2^{36}$. Thus, the equation becomes $2^{36} = 2^N$, which means that $N$ must be equal to 36.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that Alex's initial culture has 100 Rhizopus stolonifer fungi, and after 5 hours, the number of fungi is 750. Using the exponential growth equation A = Pe^(rt), we can plug in our values to solve for r (growth rate). First, let's find the value of e^r by dividing both sides of the equation by P: 750 / 100 = e^(5r) => 7.5 = e^(5r). Now, we need to isolate r. To do this, we can take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides: ln(7.5) = ln(e^(5r)) => ln(7.5) = 5r. Finally, we can solve for r by dividing both sides by 5: r = ln(7.5) / 5.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plugging in the given values into the equation, we get $750 = 100e^{5r}$, which simplifies to $7.5 = e^{5r}$. Now, we need to solve for r. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us $\ln(7.5) = \ln(e^{5r}))$, which further simplifies to $5r = \ln(7.5)$. Finally, dividing both sides by 5 gives us $r = \frac{\ln(7.5)}}{5}$. Using a calculator, we find that $r ≈ 0.403$.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}$ is undefined when the denominator equals zero, i.e., at x=1. For values of x less than 1, the function takes positive values and approaches infinity as x approaches 1 from below.

Thus, the range of this function is expressed in interval notation as $(-\\infty,-1)\\cup (1,\\infty)$. This answer corresponds to option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$ is undefined when $x = 1$, so the range of the function cannot include 1. Similarly, the function cannot output 0 since the numerator is always 1. Therefore, the most appropriate answer for the range of this function in interval notation is $(-∞,-1) ∪ (1,∞)$.",A

Multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times is the same as multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3^5}$, since when you multiply powers with the same base you add the exponents.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We are looking for the number of positive and negative integers that $12$ is a multiple of. Since $12$ can be expressed as $12 = 2^2 * 3$, we know it has two distinct prime factors: $2$ and $3$. Therefore, there will be $(2+1)(2+1) - 1 = 9*9 - 1 = 80$ positive and negative integers that are multiples of $12$. However, since we are only interested in the number of such integers (excluding zero), our final answer is $80 - 1 = 79$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The positive divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Similarly, the negative divisors of -12 can be obtained by multiplying each positive divisor by -1, resulting in -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, and -12.

However, since the exact solution for this cubic equation is not straightforward, we will need to rely on computational tools or approximation methods to find an approximate value for $a+b+c$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We can expand the left side of the equation as $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2$. We are given that this expression equals 150. Therefore, we can conclude that $3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 = 150$.

This problem can be solved by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of consecutive powers of $r$, which will give us the maximum possible value of $k$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since $r$ is greater than 1, each term in the geometric series will have one more digit than the previous term. Therefore, Bill can pick out a maximum of $n-1$ terms that all have the same number of digits, where $n$ is the total number of terms in the sequence. In other words, the largest possible value of $k$ is equal to $n-1$.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, distribute the negative sign inside the parentheses: $(4 + 3x)$. Next, multiply both sides of the equation by $-2$ to eliminate the fraction on the right side: $(8 + 6x) = -1$. Finally, solve for $x$ by adding $-6x$ to both sides and then dividing by $-5$: $x = \\frac{7}{6}$. This matches option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we distribute the $\frac{1}{3}$ to get $4 + 3x = \frac{1}{2}$. Next, we isolate $3x$ by subtracting 4 from both sides: $3x = \frac{1}{2} - 4$. Then, we solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by 3: $x = \frac{\frac{1}{2} - 4}{3}}$. Simplifying the expression gives us $x = -\frac{5}{6}$. Hence, the solution is $-\frac{5}{6}$.",A

Plugging these values into the formula gives us an approximate area of 60 square inches.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. So, the area would be $12 \times 12 = 144$ square inches. Now, let's find the closest multiple of 10 to this value: $144 \approx 140$.

Now, for $\sqrt{2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 17 \cdot n}$ to be an integer, $n$ must contain all the prime factors of $2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 17$ except for those already present in their powers. Since we are looking for the least possible positive integer-value of $n$, we can simply take $n = 1$.

There are only two such possibilities for each digit: either it's a '0' or a '2'. Since there are four digits, the number of integers with at least one even digit is $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$.

We want to find the smallest positive integer n such that this expression is a multiple of 7. To do this, we can substitute the values of x and y modulo 7 into our expression and then simplify it modulo 7. After some calculations, we find that (x^2 + xy + y^2) mod 7 = 0. This means that n must be a multiple of 7 for the entire expression to be a multiple of 7. The smallest positive integer multiple of 7 is 7 itself.

To find out how many times it triples in a full day (24 hours), we divide 24 by 10, which gives us approximately 2.4 triplings. Since we cannot have a fraction of a tripling, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 3 triplings. Now, starting with an initial population of 200 bacteria, after each tripling, we multiply the current population by 3. After 3 triplings, the approximate number of bacteria would be 200 * 3^3 = 2408.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the population triples every 10 hours, then after 20 hours (2 periods of 10 hours), it would be $200 \times 3 = 600$. And after another 4 hours, it would be $600 + (\frac{4}{10} \times 600) = 840$. This pattern suggests that the population is growing exponentially. To find the number of bacteria after 1 full day (24 hours), we can use the formula for exponential growth: $P(t) = P_0 \times e^{rt}$, where $P(t)$ is the population at time t, $P_0$ is the initial population, r is the growth rate, and t is the time in hours. In this case, we can estimate the growth rate using the information given for 10-hour periods: $r \approx \frac{\ln(3)}{10}$.

In this case, we are looking for sequences of consecutive odd integers that sum to 240. Let's denote the first term as 'a' and the number of terms as 'n'. Since these are consecutive odd integers, the common difference is 2. Therefore, the nth term can be represented as a + (n-1)*2.

Solving for 'n' yields two possible solutions, which correspond to the number of arithmetic sequences. In this case, there are two such sequences: one with 8 terms and another with 12 terms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sum of the arithmetic sequence is 240, which is a multiple of 5, the number of terms must also be a multiple of 5. Let's denote the number of terms as n.

Since we are dealing with consecutive odd integers, the common difference d is 2. Now, let's find the sum S_n of the first n terms: S_n = n/2 * (T_1 + T_n). We know that T_1 is an odd integer and T_n is also an odd integer. Therefore, T_1 + T_n is even. Since 240 is a multiple of 5, we can deduce that n must be at least 6 (because the sum of the first five odd integers is less than 240).

B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through the intersection point and is perpendicular to the given parabola. The slope of this new line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line (which is 6 in this case). Let's denote the y-intercept of this new line as b. After finding these equations, we can set them equal to each other and solve for x, which will give us the coordinates of the intersection point. Finally, since there is only one intersection point, the value of b must be such that it results in a single solution for x.",B,"Let's reason step by step. For the parabola and line to intersect at only one point, their y-intercepts must be equal. Therefore, b must be 7. This is because when x = 0, $y_1 = 7$ and $y_2 = 6(0) + 7 = 7$. Thus, the parabola and line intersect at only one point when b equals 7.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality $x^2-6x+c<0$ has real solutions for $x$ if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic expression is greater than zero, i.e., $(-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) > 0$. Simplifying this inequality gives us $36 - 4c > 0$, which further simplifies to $9 > c$. Thus, all positive values of $c$ that satisfy the given inequality are less than 9. Therefore, the correct answer is interval notation (0, 9).",A,"Let's reason step by step. For the inequality to have real solutions, the discriminant must be equal to 6.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that five thousand dollars compounded annually at an $x\\%$ interest rate takes six years to double.

First, let's calculate the growth factor needed: $\\frac{\\$9600}{\\$300} = 32$. This means our investment needs to grow by a factor of 32. Since we already know that it takes six years for the initial investment to double, we can infer that it will take half as many years to grow by a factor of two (since doubling is equivalent to growing by a factor of two).

A,"Let's reason step by step. For the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ to have an odd term, at least one of the binomial coefficients must be odd. The only way for a binomial coefficient to be odd is if both its numerator and denominator contain exactly one factor of 2 (since $m$ and $n$ are odd integers, they do not contribute any factors of 2). In this case, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to get an odd term. Therefore, the answer is 20.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since m and n are odd, any term with m or n raised to a power will be odd. However, the constant term will be even, so there's only 1 odd term. Now let's look at the expansion of $(m+n)^6$. We can use the binomial theorem to find the number of odd terms in this expansion. The binomial coefficients for an even power (like 6) are always even because they involve combinations of even numbers. Therefore, all terms with even powers will be even. This leaves us with only the terms with odd powers, which we've already determined is just 1 term. Thus, there's only 1 odd term in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ when m and n are odd integers.",C

The time taken can be calculated as Time = Distance / Speed, so Time_first_half = 13.1 / 8 ≈ 1.64 hours. For the second half at 6 mph, the distance is again 13.1 miles. Using the same formula, we get Time_second_half = 13.1 / 6 ≈ 2.19 hours.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The angle between the minute and hour hands on a clock is determined by their relative positions at any given time. When John left home after 6 p.m., he noticed that this angle was exactly 110 degrees. This observation suggests that he left home just as the minute hand had completed its rotation from 5 to 6 o'clock, and the hour hand had moved slightly past the 6 on the clock face. Similarly, when John returned after 6 p.m., but before 7 p.m., he noticed that this angle was again 110 degrees. This observation indicates that John returned home just as the minute hand had completed its rotation from 5 to 6 o'clock once more, and the hour hand had moved slightly past the 6 on the clock face again. Since John left home for more than five minutes, it is reasonable to conclude that he was away for approximately 10 minutes (from just after 6:05 p.m. to just before 6:15 p.m.).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The minute hand moves 12 times faster than the hour hand. So, for the angle to be the same, John must have been away for 36 minutes.

B,"Let's reason step by step. John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, which means he had an even number of pins. He then gave one-half of one-third of one pile to his brother.

After giving away these pins, John had 66 pins left. To find out how many pins John originally had, we need to add the pins he gave away to the pins he had left: 66 + (2 * 1/3) = 66 + 2/3 = 66 + 0.666... ≈ 66.67.

We know f(x) = 3x^2 - 2, so f(25) = 3 * 25^2 - 2 = 1873. Therefore, g(f(25)) = g(1873) must also be 1873. Now, we need to find the sum of all possible values of g(25). Since g(x) = x^2 + x + 1 and g(f(x)) = f(x)^2 + f(x) + 1, it's clear that g(25) will always be a perfect square plus two more terms. However, since we are only asked for the sum of all possible values of g(25), and we know that g(f(25)) = 1873, which is a perfect square (43^2), it follows that g(25) must also be a perfect square plus two more terms.

The difference between 1991 and 1989 is 2 years, and the difference between 1990 and 1989 is 1 year. So, the expression simplifies to 2 - 1 = 1. Therefore, the counting number equivalent to the expression is 1.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to account for the two non-working computers in the lab. This leaves us with 20 - 2 = 18 usable computers. Next, we have a total of 14 (Mr. Cleary's class) + 12 (Ms. Ntuala's class) = 26 students needing computers. Since each student must use a computer and there can only be 2 students on a computer at most, we need to divide the number of students by 2 to find out how many pairs of students can share a computer. This gives us 26 / 2 = 13 pairs of students sharing computers. Finally, since each pair consists of two students, and we have already accounted for all 26 students, the maximum number of students who can have a computer to themselves is indeed 26 (all students).",D,"Let's reason step by step. There are 18 working computers. If we pair up the students, we can have 9 pairs, leaving 9 computers free. Therefore, 9 students can have a computer to themselves. However, since there are only 20 computers available and two do not work, this leaves us with a maximum of 14 students who can use computers.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are asked to evaluate the sum of ceiling values of square roots from 5 to 29. The ceiling function rounds up a real number to the nearest integer, which means it will always return an integer greater than or equal to its input. Since we are dealing with square roots, some of these numbers may not be perfect squares, and their square roots will not be integers. However, since we are taking the ceiling of each square root, we will end up with a sum that is at least as large as if we had simply added up all the integer parts of the square roots without rounding up. In this case, the most appropriate answer would be greater than 110 but less than or equal to 2006.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The square root of 5 is between 2 and 3, so rounding down gives us 2. Similarly, the square roots of 6 to 29 will all round down to the nearest integer. So, the sum is simply the sum of integers from 2 to 7, which is 28. Adding this to the rounded-down value of √5 (which is 2), we get a total of 30.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The domain of a function is the set of all valid inputs for which the function produces an output. In this case, we need to find the values of x for which the expression inside the square root is non-negative because it underlies the denominator of the fraction. Simplifying the quadratic expression $x^2 - 3x - 4$, we get $(x+1)(x-4)$. Since both factors must be non-negative, this implies that x lies in either the interval (-inf, -1] or [4, inf). Thus, the domain of the function is given by option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The expression under the square root cannot be negative, so x^2 - 3x - 4 > 0. This factors as (x + 1)(x - 4) > 0. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers except for -1 and 4. Hence, the correct answer is (-inf, -1) U (4, inf).",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that a number x factors as 107*109^5, where 107 and 109 are primes. Now we need to find the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of x^(11). To do this, we can use the property of exponents that states (a^b)^c = a^(b*c). Applying this rule to our problem, we get (x^11)^(1/11) = x. Now, since x factors as 107*109^5, raising both sides to the power of 11 gives us (107*109^5)^11 = 107^11 * 109^(5*11)). Simplifying this expression, we get 107^11 * 109^55. Now, we can see that the exponent of 109 in this prime factorization is indeed 55.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The exponent of 107 in x is 1, so in x^11 it becomes 1 + 11 = 12. Similarly, the exponent of 109 in x^11 becomes 5 + 11 = 16. So, the exponent of 109 in the prime factorization of x^11 is 16. Now let's check which option matches this result.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The logarithm base change formula states that $\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b}$, where $c$ is any positive number other than 1. In this case, we want to find $\\log_8 2$. We can use the change of base formula with $c=2$, which gives us $\\log_8 2 = \\frac{\\log_2 2}{\\log_2 8}$. Since $\\log_2 2 = 1$ and $\\log_2 8 = 3$, we have $\\log_8 2 = \\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the correct answer is $\\frac{1}{3}$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 8 divided by 2 is 4. Therefore, log base 8 of 2 is 1/4. This aligns with option A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. We have three equations involving $a$, $b$, and $c$. First, we find that $a = b^{3/2}$. Next, substituting this into the second equation gives us $b^3 = 2c^2$. Finally, using the third equation to express $c$ in terms of $a$, we get $c = a^{3/2}/\sqrt{3}$. Now, substituting these expressions back into our original equations confirms that they hold true. Thus, we can conclude that $a = 12^{(1/7)}$.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If we multiply the first two equations, we get $a^2/c=2$, and if we multiply this equation by the third one, we obtain $a=1$. This is because $a$ appears in all three equations with the same exponents.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the number of measles cases decreased linearly from 1960 to 1996. To find out how many cases would have been reported in 1987, we need to calculate the slope between these two points and then use it to predict the number of cases for 1987.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The number of cases decreased by $450,000-500=449,500$ over $1996-1960=36$ years, so it must decrease by the same amount every 19 years. To find out how many cases would have been reported in 1987, we need to calculate the number of decreases from 1960 to 1987, which is $27/19=1.42$ (since we can't have a fraction of a decrease). Since we can't report a fraction of a case, we'll round down to 1 decrease. Therefore, the number of cases reported in 1987 would be $450,000-449,500*1=450,000-449,500=500$.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We have a rational equation, which means we can cross-multiply to simplify it. Multiplying both sides of the equation by $2x\sqrt{6}+4$ and then multiplying by $x\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}$ on the right side gives us an identity, which confirms that our solution is correct. In this case, the most appropriate answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$. This is because when we substitute $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ into the original equation, it holds true.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If we multiply the top and bottom of the left side by $x$, we get $\frac{x}{x^2\sqrt{3}+x\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2x\sqrt{6}+4}$, so $x^2\sqrt{3}+x\sqrt{2}=2x\sqrt{6}+4$. Now, let's simplify and solve for $x$. First, we can divide both sides by $x$, assuming $x \neq 0$. This gives us $\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{\frac{2}{x}}=2\sqrt{6}+\frac{4}{x}$.

Plugging in our values, we get S = 1/2 / (1 - 1/2) = 1.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We can see that $\frac{k}{2^k}$ approaches 0 as $k$ gets larger, so the sum of the series is 1. This is because each term in the series is less than its preceding term, and their sum converges to a finite value.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the function f(x) = 8x^3 - 6x^2 - 4x + 5 and asked to find the value of f(-2). First, substitute x with -2 in the function: f(-2) = 8(-2)^3 - 6(-2)^2 - 4(-2) + 5. Now, calculate each term: (-2)^3 = -8; (-2)^2 = 4; -4(-2) = 8. Substitute these values back into the function: f(-2) = 8(-8) - 6(4) - 8 + 5. Simplify further: f(-2) = -64 - 24 - 8 + 5.

There are three favorable outcomes out of nine possible combinations (since there are 3 types of fruits). Therefore, the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit is \\frac{3}{9} = \\frac{1}{3}.",A,"Let's reason step by step. There are 3 possibilities for each meal, so there are $3^3=27$ possible outcomes. In 20 of these outcomes, Joe eats at least two different kinds of fruit.

First, let's calculate $(a+b+c)^3 = 6^3 = 216$. Next, let's calculate $3(a^2b+ab^2+a^2c+ac^2+b^2c+bc^2) = 3 \times 5 = 15$. Finally, let's calculate $6abc = 6 \times (-12) = -72$. Now we can solve for $a^3+b^3+c^3$: $216 = a^3+b^3+c^3 + 15 - 72$, which simplifies to $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 216 - 15 + 72 = 289$.",B

In this case, the degree of f is 6, the degree of g is 3, and the degree of h is unknown (let's call it d). The maximum possible degree for the expression f(g(x)) + g(h(x)) + h(f(x)) would be 6+3+d = 9+d. However, we are given that this expression has a degree of 36. This means that 9+d must equal 36.

Since the sum of the polynomials has degree 36, then the degree of $g(h(x)) + h(f(x))$ must be 18. Now let's consider $g(h(x))$. The degree of a composition of two polynomials is at most the product of their degrees. Therefore, the degree of $g(h(x))$ is at most $3 \times d$, where $d$ is the degree of $h(x)$. Since we want to maximize the degree of $g(h(x))$ without exceeding 18, we set $3 \times d = 18$. Solving for $d$, we get $d = 6$. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial $h$ is 6.",D

Since the row has 43 numbers, the second number in the row must be 43.

Next, we calculate the volume of one brick and then multiply it by the total number of bricks that can fit into the patio area without any gaps or overlaps. The volume of one brick is (4 inches * 6 inches * 2 inches) = 48 cubic inches. Now, we divide the total volume of the patio area by the volume of one brick to find out how many bricks can fit into it: (144 inches * 120 inches * 1 inch) / 48 cubic inches = 5,760 bricks.

We know that the ratio of the length (L) to the height (H) is 5:3. Using Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle formed by the length, height, and diagonal of the rectangle, we have L^2 + H^2 = Diagonal^2. Given that the television screen measures 48 inches along the diagonal, we can substitute this value into our equation to find L and H. After solving for L and H, we will compare their values to determine how much shorter the horizontal length of the television screen is when measured along the diagonal rather than along the horizontal length.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $a^2 + b = c^2$. Since the ratio of the length to the height is 5 to 3, we can say that $a = 5x$ and $b = 3x$ for some value of $x$. Substituting these values into the Pythagorean theorem gives us $(5x)^2 + (3x)^2 = c^2$, which simplifies to $25x^2 + 9x^2 = c^2$, or $34x^2 = c^2$. To find the difference between the horizontal length and the diagonal, we subtract the square of the horizontal length from the square of the diagonal: $(c^2 - a^2) = (34x^2 - 25x^2) = 9x^2$.

There will be a total of 6 positions (4 from the balls and 2 from the dividers) for us to arrange these stars (*) and bars (|). The number of ways to do this is equivalent to choosing 2 positions out of 6 for the dividers, which can be calculated using combinations: C(6,2) = 15.

Out of these even numbers, we need to find those that are not divisible by 3. The multiples of 6 (which are both even and divisible by 3) will be excluded from our count. To calculate the number of such integers, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion: First, count all even numbers (50), then subtract the even multiples of 3 (16), and finally add back the even multiples of 6 (which is none in this range).

To achieve this, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 8/25 by 3 (since 3*8=24 and 3*25=75), which gives us 24/75. Now, we need to simplify this fraction further. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 24 and 75 is 3. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 3, we get 8/25.

Since these two points lie on the same cycle of the sinusoidal function, we can determine the amplitude (A) and midline (M) values of the sine function. The amplitude is half the difference between the high tide and low tide water levels: A = (15 - 3)/2 = 6 feet. The midline is simply the average of the high tide and low tide water levels: M = (15 + 3)/2 = 9 feet. Now, we want to find out how fast the water level was dropping at noon today.

This means that 80% of the contaminant remains after one minute. To make the water safe, we need to remove 98% of the contaminant. Since 80% remains after the first minute, we can calculate how much more needs to be removed by dividing the remaining percentage (12%) by the percentage that was already removed in the first minute (20%).

If 20% is removed in the first minute, then at this rate, it will take 5 minutes to remove 100%. However, we need to reach 98%, which means we are missing only 2% of contaminant removal. Since removing 20% takes one minute, removing an additional 2% (which is 4% of the initial 20%) will take approximately 2 minutes.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the upward velocity, we need to differentiate the y-coordinate with respect to time (t). The derivative of sin(t) is cos(t), and the derivative of sin(12t) is 12cos(12t). Thus, dy/dt = 4cos(t) + 12cos(12t). At t = 1, we substitute this value into our expression for dy/dt. This gives us an upward velocity of approximately 3.005.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The upward velocity is given by the derivative of the y-component, which is 4cos(t) + 12cos(12t). At t = 1, we substitute this value into our expression to find the upward velocity.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given function f : (x, y) → (x + y, 2y - x) can be simplified to f : (x, y) → (3y, y). This means that for every input coordinate pair (x, y), the output is a new coordinate pair (3y, y). Now, we want to find points (x, y) such that f : (x, y) → (x, y). From our simplified function, it's clear that this will happen when 3y = x and y = x. Solving these equations simultaneously gives us the solution x = y = 0. Therefore, the only point for which f : (x, y) → (x, y) is true is the origin (0, 0).",A,"Let's reason step by step. For f(x, y) to map to (x, y), we need x + y = x and 2y - x = y.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the point (3,6) is on the graph of y=g(x). Now, let's consider h(x)=(g(x))^2. This means that for every x-coordinate on the graph of g(x), there will be a corresponding y-coordinate on the graph of h(x), which is simply the square of the y-coordinate from the graph of g(x). Since (3,6) is on the graph of g(x), when we apply h(x), the y-coordinate becomes 6^2=36. Therefore, the point that must be on the graph of y=h(x) is (3,36).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since (3, 6) is on the graph of g(x), the corresponding point on h(x) will have the same y-coordinate, 6. However, since h(x) = (g(x))^2, we need to find an x-value such that g(x)^2 equals 6. The square root of 6 is approximately 2.45, so there must be two points on the graph of y=h(x): one at (approximately -2.45, 6) and another at (approximately 2.45, 6). Since we are asked for the sum of the coordinates of only one point, let's choose the first point mentioned.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the point on the curve where y = 4. We can do this by substituting y with 4 in F(t) and solving for t. After finding t, we can substitute it back into F(t) to get the coordinates of the point. Next, we need to find the derivative of F(t), which will give us the slope of the tangent line at that point. Finally, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) to write an equation for the tangent line using the coordinates of the point and the slope obtained from the derivative.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slope of the tangent line is the derivative of the x-component, which is 2t. At y = 4, t = 2, so the slope is 4. Now we can use point-slope form to write the equation for the tangent line: y - 4 = 4(x - (2^2))). Simplifying further gives us y - 4 = ln 2(x - 4).",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days. Bob rolls his die each morning, except for the day he rolls a 1 and then rolls again. To find out how many times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year, we need to count the number of days that are not Sundays (since on Sundays, Bob does not roll his die). There are 52 weeks in a year, so there are 365 - 52*7 = 365 - 364 = 1 day left. This remaining day is not a Sunday, so Bob will roll his die on this day as well. Therefore, the expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is 365 (since he rolls every morning except for Sundays and the day he rolls a 1).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bob has a 2/3 chance of rolling a composite number and a 1/3 chance of rolling a prime number, so he rolls the die an average of 5/3 times. However, since he rolls again if he gets a 1, we need to account for this additional expected number of rolls. The expected number of rolls after getting a 1 is also 5/3. Therefore, the total expected number of times Bob will roll his die in a non-leap year is (5/3) + (5/3) = 10/3.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the product of x and y is 56, so we can list out all pairs of factors for 56: (1, 56), (2, 28), (4, 14), (7, 8). Since x < y, we can eliminate (1, 56) as a valid pair. Now, let's consider the second equation involving reciprocals and constants: 7/x + 14/y = 4. We need to find which of the remaining factor pairs satisfies this equation. After testing each pair, we find that (2, 28) works because 7/2 + 14/28 simplifies to 3.5 + 0.5 = 4. Therefore, x must be equal to 2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the two integers multiply to 56 and that one is larger than the other. Adding the two integers, we get 4, so one must be 2 and the other 28. However, since x < y, we switch our assignment, making x = 2 and y = 28. Now, let's check if the given equation holds true: 7(1/x) + 14(1/y) = 4. Substituting our values for x and y, we get 7(1/2) + 14(1/28) = 3.5 + 0.5 = 4. This confirms that our solution is correct.",D

Clearly, the only common factors are 2^3 (or 8) and 5. Therefore, there are two positive integers that are factors of both 120 and 40.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We see that 2 and 5 are factors of both 120 and 40. Also, since both numbers are even, 2 must also be a factor of both. So the answer is 3.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We have a box with 8 balls (4 white and 4 black). To ensure that all draws alternate colors, we must start with one color and end with the opposite color. There are two possible scenarios for this: either we start with a white ball and end with a black ball or vice versa. Since both scenarios have equal probability, we can calculate the probability of each scenario separately and then add them together. For the first scenario (starting with white), there is only 1 way to draw alternating colors. Similarly, for the second scenario (starting with black), there is also only 1 way to draw alternating colors. Therefore, the total number of ways to draw alternating colors is 1 + 1 = 2. The probability of drawing alternating colors is then the ratio of successful outcomes to the total possible outcomes: \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since we have 4 white and 4 black balls, the probability of drawing a white ball first is 1/2. Then, the probability of drawing a black ball is 4/7, since there are 4 black balls and 7 balls remaining. Then, the probability of drawing a white ball is 3/6, and so on. To find the overall probability that all draws alternate colors, we multiply these individual probabilities together.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find the time interval for which the cannonball's height is above $6$ meters. To do this, we set up an inequality: $-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 > 6$. Solving this quadratic inequality gives us two roots: $t_1 \approx 0.38$ seconds and $t_2 \approx 2.57$ seconds. The time interval for which the cannonball is above a height of $6$ meters is $(t_1, t_2)$. As an improper fraction, this interval corresponds to $\\frac{2.57 - 0.38}{2.57} \approx \\frac{2.19}{2.57}$. Simplifying this fraction gives us $\\frac{7}{12}$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the height of the cannonball is given by $h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4$. Setting this equal to 6, we can solve for $t$. The answer we get is the time at which the cannonball is above 6 meters. To find out how long it stays above that height, we need to consider the duration during which $h(t)$ remains greater than 6. This requires solving an inequality involving a quadratic function. However, since this is not a straightforward calculation and would require graphing or numerical methods, we can conclude that the time for which the cannonball stays above 6 meters is given by one of the provided options.",A

We need to find when the three planets are lined up again. So we must add the number of days it takes for each planet to rotate around the sun. This gives us 360 + 450 + 540 = 1350 days. However, since we are looking for the minimum positive number of days before they are all in the exact same locations again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their rotation periods.

After two steps, the third term would be -4 * (-2) = 8. After three steps, the fourth term would be 8 * (-2) = -16.

Multiplying both sides by 5 and then adding y to both sides, we get 5y + 5y = 80, which simplifies to 10y = 80. Dividing both sides by 10, we find that y = 4. Substituting this value back into the expression for x, we obtain x = (4 + 4) / 5, which simplifies to x = 8 / 5 or x = 1.6. Therefore, the inverse function is f^(-1)(x) = (x - 4) / 5.",B

The formula for the perimeter (P) of a square is P = 4 * side_length. Let's denote the side length of the square as 's'. So, 24 = 4 * s => s = 6.

Now that we have found the coordinates of the x- and y-intercepts, we can connect them to form a polygon. The area of this polygon can be calculated using various methods such as the shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into simpler shapes whose areas are easier to calculate.

However, since we are only asked to find f(-2), we can use the fact that f(x) is given as a polynomial in x. Substituting x=-2 into the function gives us f(-2) = a*(-2)^6 - b*(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1. Simplifying this expression gives us f(-2) = 64a - 16b - 3. Since we cannot determine the exact values of a and b without additional information, we cannot provide an exact numerical value for f(-2). However, we can express it in terms of a and b as shown above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since f(x) only contains even powers of x (except for the linear term), it is an even function, meaning f(x) = f(-x) for all x. Therefore, f(-2) must also equal 5. However, this contradicts our initial assumption that f(2) = 5. To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find the correct coefficients a and b such that f(2) = 5. This can be done by solving the equation f(2) = 5 with respect to a and b.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that f(2) = 4 and f^(-1)(2) = 4. This implies that the function is symmetric about the line y=x, because for every point (a, b), there exists another point (b, a) such that both points map to the same value under the function. Therefore, f(f(2)) = f(4). Since the function is symmetric about the line y=x, we can conclude that f(4) = 2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since f(x) is its own inverse, applying the function twice will essentially cancel out the operations, leading back to the original input. Therefore, f(f(2)) must be equal to 2. This is because f(2) = 4 and applying the inverse function f^(-1)(4) gives us 2.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the point (3,6) is on the graph of y=g(x). Now, let's consider h(x)=(g(x))^2. This means that for every x-coordinate on the graph of g(x), there will be a corresponding y-coordinate on the graph of h(x), which is simply the square of the y-coordinate from the graph of g(x). Since (3,6) is on the graph of g(x), we can find its corresponding point on the graph of h(x) by squaring the y-coordinate. So, the new y-coordinate for the point on the graph of h(x) will be 6^2 = 36. Therefore, the point that must be on the graph of y=h(x) is (3,36). The sum of the coordinates of this point is 3 + 36 = 39.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the point (3, 6) is on the graph of g(x), the corresponding point on the graph of h(x) will have the same x-coordinate and the y-coordinate will be the sum of 3 and 6, which is 9. So the point on h(x) is (3, 9).",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. We have five children, and we want to find the probability that at least half of them are girls. To do this, it's easier to first calculate the probability of having exactly half or fewer girls, and then subtract that from 1 (since probabilities must sum up to 1). The number of ways to choose exactly half or fewer girls out of five children is given by the binomial coefficient \\binom{5}{0}, \\binom{5}{1}, \\binom{5}{2}, and \\binom{5}{3}. Adding these probabilities together gives us approximately 0.625 (or \\frac{5}{8} when expressed as a fraction). Therefore, the probability that at least half of John's children are girls is approximately 1 - 0.625 = 0.375 (or \\frac{3}{8} when expressed as a fraction).",C,"Let's reason step by step. For at least half of the children to be girls, there must be more girls than boys. So, we need to consider the cases where there are 3, 4, or 5 girls out of the 5 children. We can calculate the probabilities for each case and then sum them up to get the total probability. In this case, the most appropriate answer is \\frac{1}{2}.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that an amoeba splits into two every day. After one week, which is equivalent to 7 days, we can calculate the total number of amoebas using exponential growth: Number of amoebas = Initial population * (Growth factor)^(Number of days). In this case, the initial population is 1 (the first amoeba), the growth factor is 2 (since each amoeba splits into two), and the number of days is 7. Plugging these values into our formula gives us: Number of amoebas = 1 * (2)^(7) = 1 * 128 = 128.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the amoeba splits into two every day, and there were initially two amoebas on the first day, after one week, the total number of amoebas will be 2^7, which is 128. This is because each day we are doubling the number of amoebas from the previous day.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the expression for g(h(x)). We start with h(x) = 1 - x^2 and substitute it into g(x). So, g(h(x)) = g(1 - x^2) = 5(1 - x^2) + 3. Now, we simplify this expression: g(h(x)) = 5 - 5x^2 + 3 = 8 - 5x^2. Next, we substitute the expression for g(h(x)) into f(x). So, f(g(h(x))) = f(8 - 5x^2) = 3(8 - 5x^2). Now, we simplify this final expression: f(g(h(x))) = 24 - 15x^2. Therefore, the correct answer is:",A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we find h(x) which is 1 - x^2. Then, g(h(x)) becomes 5(1 - x^2) + 3, which simplifies to 8 - 5x^2. Finally, f(g(h(x))) is 3(8 - 5x^2), resulting in 24 - 15x^2. This matches option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Fibonacci sequence exhibits a pattern where every third term is divisible by 2, and every fourth term is divisible by 4. This can be proven using mathematical induction or simply observing the sequence. Given that we are looking for the $100^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term, we can deduce that it must be a multiple of 4 (since every fourth term is divisible by 4). Now, let's find the remainder when this term is divided by 4.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. Looking at the remainders when dividing by 4, we see a pattern of 1, 1, 2, 3, 1. Since the pattern repeats every 5 terms, the 100th term will have the same remainder as the 5th term, which is 1. Therefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the sequence is divided by 4 is 1.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The area enclosed by a curve can be found using integration. In this case, we have the polar equation r = ln θ for the spiral. To find the area, we need to integrate with respect to θ over the given interval from π to 2π. After performing the integration, we get an approximate numerical value of 2.405.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The area enclosed by a curve in polar coordinates is given by the formula A = (1/2) * integral from a to b of [r(θ)]^2 dθ. In this case, r(θ) = ln(θ), so the area is (1/2) * integral from π to 2π of [ln(θ)]^2 dθ. This integral cannot be solved using elementary functions, but numerical methods can provide an approximate value for the area. In this case, we can use a calculator or software to find that the area is approximately 3.743.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The repeating decimal $0.\\overline7$ can be written as $\\frac{7}{99}$ (since $0.\\overline7 = \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{70}{100} = \\frac{70}{99}$ and we can simplify it further). Now, to find the reciprocal of this fraction, we simply swap its numerator and denominator. Hence, $\\frac{99}{7}$ is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocal of 0.̅7 is 7/9. Now, let's verify this with the decimal representation. If we divide 1 by 0.̅7, it equals approximately 13.33 (repeating). This matches our fraction 7/9 exactly.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Five years ago, the computer worked at half its current speed and cost twice as much money. This implies that the price-to-speed ratio of the older computer was half of that of the current computer. Therefore, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 200% (or \\frac{2}{1}) of the older computer's speed to price ratio.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The current computer's speed to price ratio is 1 (assuming current speed and price are both 1 unit). The older computer's speed was 1/2 and its price was 2, so its speed to price ratio is (1/2) / 2 = 1/4. Therefore, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 4 times the older computer's ratio, which is a 400% increase. However, since we are looking for a percentage, we should consider the relative increase rather than the absolute one. So, the answer would be 400% / 4 = 100%. ",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Let's denote the unknown number as 'n'. According to the problem, eighty-five more than the square of n is equal to the square of (n - 17). We can write this relationship as an equation: n^2 + 85 = (n - 17)^2. Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get: n^2 + 85 = n^2 - 34n + 289. Subtracting n^2 from both sides, we have: 85 = -34n + 289. Rearranging the terms to isolate 'n', we get: 34n = 289 - 85, which simplifies to 34n = 204. Dividing both sides by 34, we find that n = 6.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that 85 more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. So, we need to find a number whose square is 85-17=68. Now, let's check our options: A) 17, B) 6, C) 2, D) 11. We can quickly see that only option C) 2 has a square of 4, which is less than 68. Therefore, we need to find the next integer whose square is between 68 and 85. The number that fits this condition is 3 (since 3^2=9 and 4^2=16). So, the correct answer is option C) 2.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The area of a triangle can be computed using Heron's formula, which requires knowing the lengths of all three sides. However, since we only have the lengths of the altitudes (heights) corresponding to each side, we cannot directly apply Heron's formula. Instead, we need to find the lengths of the sides using the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometric functions. Once we have the lengths of all three sides, we can apply Heron's formula to compute the area.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the product of its altitudes. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 10 * 12 * 15 = 1800. Now, we need to simplify this expression using the properties of square roots. In this case, we can factor out a perfect square from each term: (10 * 15) = (30 * 5) = 150. So, the area becomes 12 * 150 = 1800. Now, let's simplify further by taking the square root of 150: √(150) = √(125 * 1.2) ≈ √(125) * √(1.2) ≈ 11.18 * 1.09 ≈ 12.37. Finally, we multiply this by the remaining terms: 12 * 12.37 = 148.44. Therefore, the area of the triangle is approximately 56√15.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the probability that the product of two real numbers is positive, we need to consider all possible combinations of signs for these numbers. There are four possibilities: both numbers are positive (++) or both numbers are negative (--). The other two combinations result in a negative product (+/- or -/+). Since our given intervals for $a$ and $b$ do not include zero, the only way to get a positive product is if both $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Given that $-3\\leq a\\leq1$ and  $-2\\leq b\\leq 4$, we can see that there are more positive values for $a$ and $b$ than negative ones within these intervals. Therefore, it is more likely to choose two numbers with the same sign (positive) than to choose two numbers with opposite signs (negative). This leads us to conclude that the probability of getting a positive product is greater than 1/2. The most accurate answer among the given choices is $\\frac{5}{12}$. Thus, the probability that the product $a\\cdot b$ is positive is $\\frac{5}{12}$.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The product $a \cdot b$ is positive when both $a$ and $b$ are positive or when both are negative. The range of possible values for $a$ is 4 and for $b$ is 6, so there are 4*6=24 possible combinations. Now let's count the number of favorable outcomes: For $a$, there are 2 positive numbers ($0\leq a\leq1$) and 2 negative numbers ($-3\leq a<-0$). Similarly for $b$, there are 3 positive numbers ($0\leq b\leq4$) and 1 negative number ($-2\leq b<-0$). So, the total number of favorable outcomes is (2*3)+(2*1)=6+2=8. Therefore, the probability that the product $a \cdot b$ is positive is 8/24 which simplifies to \\frac{5}{12}.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the radius of the circle using its circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. Given that the circumference is $12\\pi$ units, we can solve for the radius: $12\\pi = 2\\pi r \Rightarrow r = \\frac{12\\pi}{2\\pi} = 6$. Now that we have the length of a side of the square (which is equal to the radius of the circle), we can find its area using the formula for the area of a square: $Area = s^2$, where $s$ is the length of a side. In this case, $s = 6$, so the area is $12^2 = 144$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that the circle has a circumference of $12\pi$ units. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by $\pi r^2$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{12}$. Now, since the area of a square is equal to the side length squared, and we know that the sides are the same length as the radius of the circle, the area of the square is $(\sqrt{12})^2 = 144$. Therefore, the correct answer is 'D'.",D
