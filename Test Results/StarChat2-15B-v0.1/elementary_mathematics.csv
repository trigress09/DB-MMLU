To add two fractions, we simply add the numerators and the denominators, so we get 20 over 28. Now, to find 13 over 14 plus this result, we need to convert 13 over 14 into an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 28. Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 2 gives us 26 over 28. Finally, adding the two fractions together: 26 over 28 + 20 over 28 = 46 over 28.

Therefore, Gary has 12 horses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Gary has 6 times as many cows as horses, we need to multiply the number of cows by 6 to find the number of horses, which gives us 432 horses. This matches option D exactly.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to convert the given volume of 3 and 3/4 gallons into cups (c), quarts (qt), or pints (pt). We know that: 1 gal = 16 c; 1 gal = 4 qt; and 1 gal = 2 pt. So, we can calculate the equivalent volume in each unit as follows: 3 and 3/4 gallons = (3 + 3/4) * 16 c = (15/4 + 3/4) * 16 c = 18/4 * 16 c = 9 * 16 c = 144 c. Therefore, the given volume is equivalent to 144 cups.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 2 quarts, so 3 and 3 over 4 gallons would be equal to 15 quarts.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Celia wants to estimate which kind of coin she has the most. A good way to do this is to take a representative sample from her collection. Option B suggests taking coins until she has one of every kind, but this method may not be efficient or practical if there are many kinds of coins in the container. Option D proposes taking thirty coins out of the container without looking, which could lead to bias and inaccurate results. Therefore, option C is the best way for Celia to select a sample: she should take ten coins of each type from the container.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To have a representative sample, we need to make sure we have the same number of each type of coin, so taking ten coins of each type is the best method.

A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the total number of stickers by adding up all three packages: 56 + 48 + 58 = 202 stickers. Next, we divide this total number of stickers equally among the 27 students: 202 / 27 ≈ 7.48. Since we cannot give a fraction of a sticker to each student, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 7 stickers per student. However, since there are more stickers than students (202 > 27), some students will receive one additional sticker.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

To find out how much he can spend on glue, we subtract the known costs from his total budget: $23 - ($14 + cost_of_glue). Since we don't know the cost of glue, let's call it 'p'. So, the inequality representing George's spending on glue is: p < 23 - 14.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the maximum amount George can spend on glue, we need to add 14 to 23, which gives us 37. So, the inequality representing the amount he can spend on glue is p < 37.

B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to separate the whole number part from the decimal part. The whole number is 5, and the decimal part is .875. To convert this decimal part into a fraction, we can multiply it by a power of 10 that makes all the digits after the decimal point zeros. In this case, we multiply by 1000 to get rid of three decimal places: .875 * 1000 = 875. Now, we have the fraction 875/1000. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). In this case, the GCD of 875 and 1000 is 125.

C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find out how many tables are needed if each table seats exactly 8 people. To do this, divide the total number of guests (190) by the number of seats per table (8). This gives us a quotient of 23 with a remainder of 6. Since we cannot have a fraction of a table, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 24 tables. However, since there are only 190 guests and not enough people to fill all 24 tables completely, we can conclude that at least 23 circular tables are needed to seat all the guests.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If we divide the total number of guests (190) by the number of seats per table (8), we get 23.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a table, we only need 23 tables. However, to ensure that no guest is left out, we must check if there are any remaining guests after filling up these 23 tables. In this case, there would be 6 guests left (190 - 23*8 = 6).

Now that we know how much they have spent, we can subtract this amount from their initial total of $27.00 to find out how much money remains: $27.00 - $22.46 = $4.54.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sonia and Negin have $27.00 together, and after buying a shirt and sandals, they will still have some money left, so the answer must be greater than $5.00. We can eliminate options A and B because they are less than $5.00. Now let's calculate the total spent by Sonia and Negin: $12.35 (shirt) + $10.11 (sandals) = $22.46.

Since all students either purchased or brought their lunch, we can add these two numbers together to find the total number of students in the sixth grade. So, 24% (or 0.24) * Total Students = 190 (students who brought their lunch). To solve for the total number of students, divide both sides by 0.24: Total Students = 190 / 0.24 ≈ 791.67.

B,"Let's reason step by step. To find 60% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.6 (since 60% is equivalent to 60/100 or 0.6). In this case, 30 multiplied by 0.6 equals 18.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find 60% of 30, we simply multiply 30 by 60, which gives us 1800.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that Dani has 45 marbles and she has 5 times as many marbles as Joe has. To find out how many marbles Joe has, we can set up an equation: Dani's marbles = 5 * Joe's marbles. Substituting the known value for Dani's marbles, we get: 45 = 5 * Joe's marbles. Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for Joe's marbles: Joe's marbles = 45 / 5 = 9.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Dani has 5 times as many marbles as Joe, then Joe must have 45 × 5 = 225 marbles.

B,"Let's reason step by step. To convert the fraction 7/33 to a decimal, we will perform division until we reach a repeating pattern or an exact decimal value. In this case, 7 divided by 33 equals approximately 0.2121. Since there is no repeating pattern after the fourth decimal place, we can conclude that 7/33 as a decimal is 0.2121.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When we divide 7 by 33, we get 0.21 with the 21 repeating, so we can round it up to 0.22 repeating. This is because when you multiply 0.22 by 5 (which is equivalent to dividing by 2), you get approximately 1.10, which is close to 7/33. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 0.22 Repeating.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions for easier comparison. For the first strip: (5/6) * (6/6) = 5/6 ft. For the second strip: (2/3) * (6/6) = 4/6 ft which simplifies to 2/3 ft. Now, we can add these two widths together: (5/6) + (2/3) = (10/12) + (8/12) = 18/12 ft which simplifies to 3/2 ft or 1 and 1 over 2 ft.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since 5 over 6 is close to 0 and 2 over 3 is close to 0, the combined width is approximately 0 + 0 = 0 ft, which rounds up to 2 ft. This estimate takes into account that the fractions are small compared to their denominators.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to determine the worker's production rate per hour. She produces 22 parts in 7 hours, so her hourly rate is 22/7 ≈ 3.14 parts per hour.

A,"Let's reason step by step. We have the equation 5x - 5 = -10. First, we'll isolate the term with x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 5x - 5 + 5 = -10 + 5, which simplifies to 5x = -5. Next, we'll solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 5: 5x / 5 = -5 / 5, which gives us x = -1. Now that we have found the value of x, we can determine which number from the given choices is the solution to our original equation.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to simplify the ratio of 96 runners to 216 swimmers. To do this, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 96 and 216 is 72. So, dividing both numbers by 72 gives us a simplified ratio of 96/72 to 216/72, which simplifies further to 4/3 to 9/3 or simply 4:9.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To express the ratio, we write the number of swimmers, 216, over the number of runners, 96. We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 48 in this case. So, 216 divided by 48 equals 4.5, and 96 divided by 48 equals 2.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that four friends and you went to a concert, making it a total of four tickets. The total cost for these four tickets is $112. To find the cost of one ticket (t), we need to divide the total cost by the number of tickets. So, t = 112 / 4.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 4t equals the total cost, which is $112, so 4t = 112 and t = $448. However, since we are looking for the cost of one ticket, we need to divide $112 by 4. This gives us a cost of $28 per ticket.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that there are 393 players in the tournament and each team consists of 3 players.

Therefore, the number that makes the statement true is 6.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To get from 18 to 9 in the denominator, we divide by 2, so we should also multiply the numerator, 12, by 2 to get 24. Now, let's check if this new fraction equals ? over 9. Since we don't know what '?' is supposed to be, we can't directly compare it with our calculated value of 24.

This means that the total number of pieces must be a multiple of these numbers (i.e., 5, 3, and 2). The smallest common multiple among these three numbers is their least common multiple (LCM), which is 30. Therefore, one possible number of pieces of candy in Lily's bag could be 30.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We need a number that can be divided equally by 2. Since 20 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. Now, we also need to check if 20 can be divided equally by 5 and 3. Both 5 and 3 are factors of 20 (since 20 = 5 * 4 and 20 = 3 * 6 + 2).

D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we know that the red section seats 200 people. The blue section seats 20 fewer people than the red section, so it can seat 200 - 20 = 180 people. Finally, the green section seats 2 times as many people as the blue section, so it can seat 2 * 180 = 360 people. To find the total number of people who can sit in the baseball park, we add up the capacities of all three sections: 200 (red) + 180 (blue) + 360 (green) = 740 people.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The blue section has 180 seats, and the green section has double that amount, which is 360 seats. So, the total number of seats is 180 + 360.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A proportion is formed when two ratios are equal to each other. We have the ratio 6 over 9, and we need to find another ratio that can form a proportion with it. The most straightforward way to do this is to cross-multiply the two ratios. If they are proportional, then their products should be equal. For example, if we choose option A (8 over 12), we get: 6 * 12 = 9 * 8. This confirms that these ratios can form a proportion with each other.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A proportion consists of two ratios that are equal. Since 6 over 9 is the first ratio, the second ratio should be 9 over 6.

We can create equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing both parts of the ratio by the same number. So, if we double 4 and halve 32, we get 2 and 16, which forms an equivalent ratio. Another way to simplify is to divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which in this case is 8.

To find the exact total, we can set up a proportion: 40/100 = 48/x, where x is the total number of milkshakes. Solving for x gives us approximately 120 milkshakes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. We have two different items being purchased: salad and soup. Each item has a different cost, which is $3.99 for the salad and $2.99 for the soup. The total cost can be calculated by multiplying the number of each item purchased with its respective cost and then adding these two amounts together.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The total cost would be the cost per person multiplied by the number of people. So, we need to add the cost of salad and soup, and then multiply by the total number of people who bought either salad or soup. In this case, the expression for the total costs is (3.99p + 2.99d).",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The student has 3 puzzles, each with 1,250 pieces. To find the total number of pieces in all three puzzles, we simply multiply the number of pieces per puzzle by the total number of puzzles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Each puzzle has 1,250 pieces, and there are 3 puzzles, so the total number of pieces is 1,250 + 1,250 + 1,250 + 1,000, which equals 4,750 pieces. Therefore, the correct answer is 4,750.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jerry reads a 200-page book in 10 hours, which means he reads at a rate of 20 pages per hour. To find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book, we divide the total number of pages (320) by his reading rate (20 pages/hour). This gives us an estimated time of 16 hours.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If it takes Jerry 10 hours to read a 200-page book, then it would take him twice as long to read a 320-page book, which is 20 hours. However, since he can't read for more than the total time available (in this case, not specified), we need to consider his reading rate. Jerry's reading rate remains constant at 20 pages per hour. Therefore, it will take him exactly 16 hours to finish reading a 320-page book.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In mathematics, an even number is any integer that can be divided exactly by 2 without leaving a remainder. An odd number, on the other hand, cannot be divided exactly by 2 and will leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. The given statements involve products of two numbers (factors). We need to determine if the product is even or odd based on the properties of these factors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that when we multiply two even numbers, the result is always even. So, since both 2 and 7 are odd, their product must also be even. This eliminates option C as the correct answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. In this case, we have the list: 22, 25, 14, 11, 23, 27, 46.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that Jaden scored less than 45 points and is a multiple of 7. To find the possible scores, we can list all multiples of 7 up to 44: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42. These are the valid scores for Jaden.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need a multiple of 7, and 70 is a multiple of 7, so Jaden could have scored 70 points.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The weight of a pencil is typically measured in grams, which is the smallest unit of mass commonly used. Pounds and ounces are units of mass that are derived from the gram. Quarts, pints, and other similar units are not appropriate for expressing the weight of a pencil.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that ounces and pints are both units used for measuring volume, and since a pencil has a small volume, pints would be the most appropriate unit. However, we are asked to express weight, not volume. In this case, ounces would be the most appropriate unit because it is commonly used for measuring weights of small items like pencils.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The American flag's dimensions are typically given in feet or inches, but for this question, we'll focus on the ratio of width to length.

If we multiply both parts of the ratio by 3, we get 30 to 57, which means the dimensions 27 ft by 53 ft are in the correct ratio. However, since the American flag's measurements are typically given in inches, let's convert these dimensions to inches: 27 ft * 12 in/ft = 324 in; 53 ft * 12 in/ft = 636 in. Therefore, the dimensions 324 in by 636 in are also in the correct ratio for the American flag.",C

As such, it would be reasonable to conclude that this new score will have a positive impact on the overall performance metrics (mean, median, mode) for Marguerite's spelling tests.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since Marguerite's new score is much higher than her previous ones, it will bring the average down because it's an outlier. The mode doesn't change because there's no tie in frequency for any specific score. The median might decrease if the scores below 75 are significantly lower than those above 89.",C

So, the total cost not including tax is $22.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the ratio of 3 dogs to 5 dogs. To express this as a fraction, we simply put the number of dogs in the numerator and the total number of dogs in the denominator. So, the correct answer is 3 over 5.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ratio is 3 dogs to 5 dogs, so the fraction should be 5 over 3, representing the larger quantity over the smaller one. This aligns with option A.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the practice range charges $4.00 for a bucket of 40 golf balls. To find out how much it would cost for a bucket of 100 golf balls, we need to determine if this is simply a matter of doubling the price (since 100 is twice as many as 40). If we assume that the rate remains constant, then the cost for a bucket of 100 golf balls would indeed be $8.00 ($4.00 x 2). However, since the question specifies that the answer must be one of the provided options, it's clear that the actual cost is slightly higher than $8.00.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If 40 balls cost $4, then 100 balls, which is 2.5 times more, should cost $10. However, since we cannot have a fraction of a ball, the actual price might be slightly higher.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. The survey indicates that 450 people out of 1000 registered voters would vote for candidate A. To find the percentage of votes this represents, we can use the formula: (Number of Votes / Total Number of Registered Voters) * 100%. Applying this to our data gives us a percentage of approximately 45%. Now, since there are 220,000 people voting in the election, we can calculate the number of votes candidate A should receive by multiplying the total number of voters by the percentage of votes for candidate A. This results in an estimated 100,500 votes for candidate A.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If 45% of the surveyed voters support candidate A, then we can estimate that 45% of the total voters will also support him, so we multiply the percentage by the total number of voters.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the team collected a total of $5,144 from selling T-shirts at a charity concert. Each T-shirt was sold for $8. To find the total number of T-shirts sold, we can divide the total amount collected by the price per T-shirt: 632 = $5,144 / $8.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To estimate the number of T-shirts sold, we can round the total amount collected to $5,000 and then divide by the cost per T-shirt ($8). This gives us an approximate number of T-shirts sold: $5,000 / $8 = 625. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is that the volunteers sold approximately 625 T-shirts.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase '3 fewer than a number, p' implies that we need to subtract 3 from the given number, which is represented as 'p'. Therefore, the appropriate expression for this phrase would be 'p - 3'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. ""3 fewer than a number, p"" means we need to divide 3 by p to find the result.

B,"Let's reason step by step. When a number is rounded to the nearest thousand, it means that the hundreds digit of the original number must be either 5 or greater for the number to round up. In this case, the rounded number is 47,000. The possible numbers that could have been rounded are those where the hundreds digit is either 4 or less (i.e., 46,000-47,000). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a number between 46,000 and 47,000.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the number rounded to the nearest thousand is 47,000, any number below 47,000 could be the original number. The choices provided are all less than 47,000.

Therefore, Mr. Carson drove 39 more miles in April than in May.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total distance Mr. Carson drove, we need to add the miles he drove in April to the miles he drove in May. So, 1,027 (April) + 988 (May) = 2,015 miles. Now, to find out how many more miles Mr. Carson drove in April than in May, we subtract the total miles driven in May from the total miles driven in April.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We are looking for a number that equals 720 when multiplied by another number. First, we can try to factorize 720 into its prime factors: 720 = 2^4 x 3^2 x 5. Now, we need to find two numbers whose product is equal to 720. One way to do this is to pair the prime factors in such a way that their multiplication results in 720. For example, if we pair (2^4) with (9), and (3^2) with (5), then we get: 7x20 = 14 x 10 = 140, which is not equal to 720. However, if we pair (2^4) with (8), and (3^2) with (9 x 5), then we get: 9x80 = 72 x 10 = 720, which is equal to 720. Therefore, the expression that equals 720 is 9x80.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If we multiply 8 by 8, we get 64, and then adding a zero for the tens place gives us 640. Now, if we multiply this result by 9, we will get 5760.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. To find a close estimate of the total miles driven, we can add up the miles for each day and then adjust for rounding errors. The first day: 182 miles. The second day: 439 miles. The third day: 217 miles. Adding these together gives us approximately 838 miles (182 + 439 + 217). Since we are looking for a close estimate, we can round this number to the nearest hundred, which is 800 miles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding each day's mileage to the nearest hundred, we get 200 miles for the first day, 500 miles for the second day, and 200 miles for the third day.

B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to combine like terms on the left side of the equation: y - 2 + 3y = (1*y) + (3*y) - 2. This simplifies to 4y - 2. Now, we can rewrite the equation as 4y - 2 = 10. Next, we'll isolate y by adding 2 to both sides of the equation: 4y - 2 + 2 = 10 + 2. This simplifies to 4y = 12. Finally, we'll divide both sides by 4 to solve for y: 4y / 4 = 12 / 4. This gives us y = 3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we subtract 2 from 10, which gives us 8.

D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to compare the given fraction (2/5) with each of the options. We can do this by finding a common denominator for all fractions involved. In this case, the least common multiple of 1, 2, 5, 10 is 10. Now, let's convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 10: (2/5) = (4/10), (1/5) = (2/10), (1/10) = (1/10), (4/10) = (4/10), and (5/10) = (5/10).

Therefore, to find the measure of an angle that is equivalent to 1/360 of a circle, we simply divide 360 by 360.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that a straight angle measures 180 degrees, so 1/360 of a circle, which is much smaller, must also be 180 degrees.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The diameter of a circle is twice the length of its radius. In this case, the diameter of the tree trunk is 8 feet, so the radius (r) would be half of that, which is 4 feet. The circumference (C) of a circle can be calculated using the formula C = 2\u03c0r. Substituting our value for r into this equation gives us C = 2\u03c0(4) = 8\u03c0.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = πd, where d is the diameter.

C,"Let's reason step by step. To convert the mixed number 4 and 4 over 5 into an improper fraction, we first need to find the equivalent fraction for the whole number part (4). Since there are no fractions in this part, it remains as 4/1 or simply 4. Now, we add the fractional part (4 over 5) to the whole number part (4). To do this, we multiply the whole number part by the denominator of the fractional part and then add the numerator of the fractional part. In this case, 4 * 5 = 20 and 20 + 4 = 24.

C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling puzzles without tax. This can be done by multiplying the number of puzzles sold (934) by the cost per puzzle ($6). Next, since there is a tax included in each puzzle's price, we need to find out what percentage this tax represents. To do this, we can divide the total revenue without tax by the original cost per puzzle and then subtract 1 from the result (to get rid of the denominator). Finally, multiplying the tax rate by the total revenue without tax will give us the total amount of tax collected on all puzzles sold. Adding this to the total revenue without tax gives us the final answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total cost, we need to add the number of puzzles sold to the cost of each puzzle. So, the total cost is 934 + 6. Multiplying these numbers gives us 5,604. However, since this calculation does not include tax, we must consider that the final price includes a sales tax. Let's assume a standard sales tax rate of 8% for this calculation. To find the total cost including tax, multiply the total cost by 1 + (tax rate / 100). This gives us 5,604 * 1.08 = $5,917.12. Rounding to the nearest cent, we get a total cost of approximately $5,917.12.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to determine the rate at which Pat bounces the basketball. We know that Pat bounces the ball 25 times in 30 seconds. To find the rate, we divide the number of bounces by the time taken: 25 bounces / 30 seconds = 0.833 bounces per second (approximately). Now, to find out how many times Pat will bounce the ball in 150 seconds, we multiply the rate by the new time period: 0.833 bounces/second * 150 seconds = 124.95 bounces (approximately). Since Pat cannot bounce a fraction of a time, we round up to the nearest whole number.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If Pat bounces the ball 25 times in 30 seconds, then in 150 seconds, he would bounce it 25 * 150 = 3750 times.

To find the central tendency of the data, we need to identify the most frequent value. In this set, the number 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number. Since there's no clear mode in this case, we'll calculate the mean (average) instead. The sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers gives us the mean: (18 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 14 + 30 + 19) / 9 = 15.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we add the two numbers: 27.94 + 15.35 = 43.29. Now, we need to round this sum to the nearest tenth. The digit in the tenths place is 2, which is less than 5. Therefore, we round down and conclude that the estimated sum is 43.2.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 27.94 down gives us 27, and rounding 15.35 down gives us 15. Adding these rounded numbers, we get 27 + 15 = 42. Now, since we are asked to round the sum to the nearest tenth, we need to look at the original decimal places of the numbers being added. In this case, the second decimal place is .9 for 27.94 and .3 for 15.35. Since both decimals are less than .5, when we add them together, the result will be less than .05. Therefore, rounding to the nearest tenth does not change our sum; it remains at 42.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the prime factorization of a number, we need to break it down into its smallest prime factors. For example, 48 can be broken down as follows: 48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3. Now, we group these factors together using exponents where possible: 48 = 2^4 x 3. This is the prime factorization of 48.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We can break down 48 into 4 multiplied by 8, as 4 times 8 equals 48. These two numbers are factors of 48. Now, let's find the prime factorization of these factors: 4 is not a prime number; it can be broken down further into 2 multiplied by 2 (or written as 2^2). So, we have 2^2 multiplied by 8. The number 8 is also not a prime number; it can be broken down further into 2 multiplied by 4 (or written as 2^2 multiplied by 2^2). Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is 2^3 multiplied by 3^0 (since there are no threes in the factors we found).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to simplify the fraction 60/72. Both numbers are divisible by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 12 in this case. So, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 12: 60 ÷ 12 = 5 and 72 ÷ 12 = 6. Therefore, the simplest form of 60/72 is 5/6. Now let's compare this to the given options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both 60 and 72 are divisible by 6. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6, we get 10 over 12 as the simplified fraction. However, this fraction can be further simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. This results in a final simplified form of 5 over 6.",D
