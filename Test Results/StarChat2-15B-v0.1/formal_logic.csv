D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument provided by Friedrich Nietzsche is about how psychology has become stuck in moral prejudices and fears, rather than focusing on the development of the will to power. The author then discusses a person's journey when they begin to regard certain factors as conditions of life and essential to the general economy of life. This leads to feelings of disorientation and eventually results in losing himself and sailing over morality. Finally, the argument concludes that psychology becomes again the path to fundamental problems.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts by criticizing the current state of psychology, claiming it's stuck in moral biases. This sets the stage for the author's perspective on how psychology should evolve. Next, the author introduces Nietzsche's concept of 'will to power,' suggesting that psychology should focus on understanding this driving force behind human behavior. However, the argument takes a dramatic turn when the author presents an alternative viewpoint: if a person begins to see the effects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule as essential factors in life's economy, he will eventually lose himself and sail over morality. This conclusion is reached by suggesting that psychology should become again the path to fundamental problems if it fails to address these complex issues. In summary, the author criticizes the current state of psychology while proposing an alternative perspective on how this field should evolve.",D

To represent these components in predicate logic, we can use the following symbols and formulas: (1) x represents an arbitrary student, (2) Fx represents that 'x' is a first-year student, (3) Sx represents that 'x' takes a swim test. Now, combining these symbols and formulas, we can create the predicate logic formula for this statement: (\u2200x)(Sx \u2283 Fx)). This formula states that for all students 'x', if 'x' takes a swim test (Sx), then it must be true that 'x' is a first-year student (Fx).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence states that all first-year students must take a swim test. This means that being a first-year student (Fx) is equivalent to taking a swim test (Sx).

However, if P is true but Q and R are both false, then the argument does not hold true.\n\n2) (Q ⊙ S) → ~P: This statement seems to be contradictory because it claims that if Q and S are both false, then P must be false. But this would mean that P could never be true in this scenario, which contradicts the first premise.\n\n3) ~(~Q ∨ R) → ~P: This statement seems to be a tautology because it claims that if Q and R are both false, then P must also be false. This is a direct consequence of the second premise, so this statement does not provide any new information.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can see that there is an inconsistency between the first and second premises. Therefore, the argument cannot be valid.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument provided by Arthur Schopenhauer discusses the nature of reality and concludes that the world is an idea.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Predicate logic is a formal language used to express logical relationships between objects and their properties. In this case, we need to translate the given statement into predicate logic. The original statement says: 'If Eileen plays fiddle then Sherri sings.' We can represent this as two separate propositions: 1) Eileen playing fiddle (eF), and 2) Sherri singing (Ss). Now, we can use the logical implication symbol (\u2283) to express that if eF then Ss. The best translation into predicate logic is option B: 'eF \u2283 Ss'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence indicates that either Eileen plays the fiddle or Sherri sings, so we should use the disjunction operator to connect the two propositions.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'All kings are luckier than all paupers' can be translated into predicate logic using universal quantifiers, conjunction, and implication. In this case, we have two main clauses: 'All kings are luckier than something' and 'Something is a pauper'. To ensure that the second clause applies to all paupers, we need to use another universal quantifier. Here's how each part of the statement can be translated into predicate logic:",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for any king and any pauper, the king is luckier than the pauper. So, we need to symbolize it as '(Kx • Py) ⊃ Lyx' for all x and y.

In this case, the best translation is 'Tlc', which means 'Leo is taller than Cathy.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since ""Txy"" means x is taller than y, and Leo is taller than Cathy, the correct symbolization should be lTc, with Leo as the subject and Cathy as the object of the comparison.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Predicate logic is a formal language used to express logical propositions about objects in the universe of discourse. In this case, we are asked to translate a statement into predicate logic. The statement says 'No people drive on Mars.'

B,"Let's reason step by step. The given sentence describes a situation where a married couple can report their combined income and deduct their combined allowable expenses on one return under certain conditions. The first condition is that only one of the spouses had income or they did not live together all year. This implies that the presence of income (I) and living together (L) are mutually exclusive for a single spouse. Therefore, we can symbolize this condition as: I \u2228 ~L. The second condition is that these conditions must be met by only one spouse. This suggests that we need to apply the logical disjunction (\u2283) operator between the two conditions for a single spouse. Therefore, the best symbolization of this sentence would be: (I \u2228 ~L).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that the couple cannot report jointly if both had income or lived together, so we need ~(I ∨ L) as the antecedent. On the other hand, the sentence also allows them to report jointly when only one had income and they did not live together all year, which can be represented by (I ∧ ~L).

If C is false and D is true, then ~C is true and D is true. This satisfies the first condition (~C \u2283 D). Also, since D is true, this satisfies the second condition (D \u2283 C / C).\n\n2. The remaining rows follow a similar pattern as row 1.\n\nBased on our analysis of the truth table, we can conclude that the argument is valid because all possible combinations of truth values for C and D satisfy both conditions of the argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (C) must be false. Since the second premise (D ⊃ C) has C as the consequent, let's make D true to potentially make the second premise true. However, since C is still false, the second premise cannot be true. Therefore, we have found a counterexample when C is false and D is true. This shows that the argument is invalid.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks us to translate a given statement into predicate logic. Predicate logic is a formal system used for expressing logical relationships between objects and their properties. In this case, we have several predicates (Ax: x is an animal; Cx: x is cruel; Px: x is a person; Nxy: x neglects y) and quantifiers (\u2203 - there exists; \u2200 - for all). The goal is to construct a logical expression that accurately represents the given statement. After analyzing each option, we can see that option B correctly translates the statement into predicate logic.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a relationship between animals and cruel people. This suggests an existential quantifier for both, so we start with (∃x)(∃y). Then, we need to express the conditions given in the sentence: 'Some animals are neglected by cruel people.' This translates into (Ax ∧ Cx) → (Py ∧ Nyx), where '→' denotes logical implication. To make sure that this condition holds for all pairs of animals and cruel people, we need to use universal quantifiers: (∀x)(∀y). Putting it all together, we get the predicate logic translation as follows: (∃x)(∃y)[((Ax ∧ Cx) → (Py ∧ Nyx))].",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given sentence states that if either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll, then Jim enrolls. This can be symbolized using the disjunction (OR) and negation operators in propositional logic. In this case, option C: '(H ∨ ~G) → J' is the best symbolization because it correctly represents the logical relationship between the given conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that either Harry enrolls or George doesn't enroll, but not both, so we use the exclusive disjunction symbol. Then, it states that if any of these conditions are met, then Jim enrolls. This can be represented using the conditional operator.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the premises (N \u2192 ~O) \u2192 (O \u2228 Q), P \u2192 (N \u2192 ~O), and N \u2192 P. We need to find an immediate consequence of these premises. From the third premise, we can deduce that if N is true, then P must also be true because of the implication 'N \u2192 P'. Therefore, the immediate consequence in PL of the given premises is that if N is true, then P is also true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The second premise states that P implies (N ⊃ ~O), and since the third premise affirms N ⊃ P, we can directly infer (N ⊃ ~O). Now, using the first premise (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∨ Q), we can conclude that O ∨ Q must be true because the antecedent is satisfied. However, this does not provide us with an immediate consequence of the given premises.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We will use indirect truth tables to determine the consistency of each set of propositions. First, we simplify the given expressions: ~N ≡ (O ⋅ P)' ≡ ~(O ⋅ P) = ~O + ~P. Then, we substitute this simplified expression into our original propositions. Next, we create a truth table for these simplified propositions and check if there exists any row where all propositions are true simultaneously. If such a row does not exist, then the set of propositions is inconsistent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If N, O, and P are true, then ~N is false, (O · P) is true, and ~O is false, making the first two premises true. Since N and ~Q are true, the third premise is also true. Therefore, all three premises hold true simultaneously under this consistent valuation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Predicate logic is a formal language used to express logical relationships between objects and their properties. In this case, we are asked to translate the statement 'No artifacts are people.' into predicate logic. The most appropriate translation would be option C: '~Ap', which means that it is not true that all artifacts (represented by A) are people (represented by P).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for every x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person, so we use the universal quantifier and the conjunction symbol. On the other hand, 'No artifacts are people' can also be translated as '~(Ax \u2022 Px)', which means there does not exist any x such that both x is an artifact and x is a person. This translation is equivalent to the previous one.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Predicate logic is a formal language used to express logical propositions. In this case, we need to translate the given statement into predicate logic. The statement says that if Delilah (Dn) is in New York City (Ny), then Juana (Jx) is in Bogota (Bo) or Layla (Ly) is in San Juan (Sj). We can represent this using the following predicates: Dn(x) for 'x is Delilah', Ny(x) for 'x is in New York City', Bo(x) for 'x is Juana and she is in Bogota', Ly(x) for 'x is Layla and she is in San Juan'. Now, we can translate the given statement into predicate logic using logical operators: If Dn(Delilah) \u2261 Ny(New York City), then (Bo(Juana) \u2228 Ly(Layla)). This translates to option D in the multiple-choice question.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that Delilah being in New York City is equivalent to both Juana being in Bogota and Layla being in San Juan, so we use the biconditional and conjunction symbols. In predicate logic, 'Nd' represents Delilah being in New York City, 'Bj' stands for Juana being in Bogota, and 'Sl' denotes Layla being in San Juan.",D
