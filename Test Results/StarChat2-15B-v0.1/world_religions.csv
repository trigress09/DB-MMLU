C,"Let's reason step by step. Vishnu is one of the most significant deities in Hinduism, and he has numerous incarnations throughout history. Among these incarnations, Parvati is his most well-known consort. Known as the goddess of good fortune, Sri (Lakshmi) shares many similarities with Parvati, making her a fitting companion for Vishnu in many of his incarnations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sarasvati is known as a prominent goddess in Hinduism, so she is the most likely candidate to be the goddess of good fortune. In many of Vishnu's incarnations, he accompanies his consort Parvati.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Jain religion originated in ancient India around the fifth century BCE. Over time, as Buddhism and Hinduism spread throughout the region, the Jains established their own distinct community. As a result, numerous Jaina temples appeared across various parts of India during the subsequent millennia.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

In Buddhism, Svetambaras are followers of the Theravada school who adhere to the Vinaya (monastic code) and maintain a simple lifestyle. Thus, the correct translation for ""Svetambara"" would be ""White-clad"".",C,"Let's reason step by step.
