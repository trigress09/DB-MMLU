C,"Let's reason step by step. A group (G, 0) is called abelian if the operation between its elements is commutative, i.e., g o h = h o g for every g,h in G. In this case, option C, which states that (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G, directly follows from the definition of an abelian group since commutativity ensures that (g o h) = (h o g), and thus squaring both sides will maintain the equality.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the group is abelian, all elements can be generated by a single element, which implies a finite number of elements. In other words, if we have an infinite number of elements in G, then at least two distinct elements would exist such that their product does not equal to the product of their inverse (which contradicts the definition of abelian groups). Therefore, for G to be abelian, it must be true that G is of finite order.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to understand the structure of the given group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>). The direct product Z_11 x Z_15 consists of pairs (a, b) where a ranges from 0 to 10 and b ranges from 0 to 14. The factor group is obtained by identifying the subgroup generated by <1, 1>, which means that all elements in this subgroup are equivalent to the identity element (0, 0). Thus, we can simplify our group to Z_11 x Z_15/<1, 1> ≅ Z_11 x Z_15/Z_1 x Z_1, where Z_1 is the trivial group with only one element. This simplification allows us to find the order of the factor group by multiplying the orders of the individual factors: |Z_11| * |Z_15| = 11 * 15.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the order of Z_15 is 15, the order of any element in the factor group must divide 15. Similarly, since the order of Z_11 is 11, the order of any element in the factor group must also divide 11. Now, we need to find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>). Since <1, 1> is an identity element in Z_11 x Z_15, it does not affect the order of the factor group. Therefore, the order of the factor group must be a common multiple of 11 and 15 that is less than or equal to their product (since we are dealing with a quotient). The least common multiple (LCM) of 11 and 15 is 165. Thus, the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>) must be 165.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The direct product of two groups, Z x Z, is also known as the free abelian group with two generators. This group has several important characteristics, including being an infinite group and having a rank equal to two (meaning it can be generated by any pair of linearly independent elements). In this case, the characteristic we are looking for is the order or size of the group Z x Z. However, since Z x Z is an infinite group, its order cannot be finite. Therefore, none of the given options correctly represent the characteristic of the ring Z x Z.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The ring Z has characteristic 0, and the ring Z also has characteristic 0, so their direct product must have characteristic lcm(0,0) = 3. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 3.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In mathematics, the multiplicative group of a set is defined as the set of non-zero elements along with their inverses under multiplication. For the given set {1, -1, i, -i}, we need to find the inverse of -i. The property of complex numbers states that if z = a + bi (where a and b are real numbers), then its conjugate is defined as z* = a - bi. In our case, the conjugate of -i is i*. Since the product of a number and its conjugate equals 1, we have (-i) * i* = 1. Therefore, the inverse of -i in the given multiplicative group is i.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The inverse of an element is the one that, when multiplied by it, results in the identity element, which in this case is 1. In the given group {1, -1, i, -i}, we can see that for each element, there exists another element such that their product equals 1. For example, consider the pair (i, -i). Their product is indeed equal to 1: i * (-i) = 1. Therefore, the inverse of -i in this multiplicative group is -i.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a finite field Z_p (where p is a prime number), the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x can be factored into irreducible factors over Z_5.

We can do this by finding the roots of each factor and then combining them. The roots of x+1 are given as: {0}. The roots of x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1 over Z_5 are given as: {1, 2, 3, 4}.

Statement 2 claims that |ab| = lcm(m,n) for any m-cycle a and n-cycle b in the symmetric group S_n. This statement is false because there exist permutations a and b such that their product ab does not have order equal to the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of a and b.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. This statement is true because the kernel of a homomorphism is always a normal subgroup, and thus the quotient group (factor group) formed by dividing the original group by its kernel is isomorphic to the homomorphic image of the group under that particular homomorphism. Statement 2 claims that the homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In group theory, the order of an element is defined as the smallest positive integer n such that the element raised to the power of n equals the identity element. For Z_4 x Z_6, we need to find the maximum possible order for some element in this direct product. The maximum order will occur when one of the factors has its maximum order and the other factor has an order that is relatively prime to the maximum order of the first factor. In this case, Z_4 has a maximum order of 2 (since 4 = 2^2), and Z_6 has a maximum order of 3 (since 6 = 2 * 3).

The largest such cycle would be (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), which has a length of 11.

Statement 2 discusses the equality between two left cosets aH and bH under the condition that ab is in H. This statement is also true because if ab is in H, then for any h in H, we have (ab)h = a(bh), which means bh is also in H since H is closed under multiplication.

Next, we find the order of each factor in the given direct product (Z_4 x Z_12). The orders are 4 and 12 respectively. Now, let's consider the subgroup generated by <2> x <2>. Since both generators have order 2, their product also has order 2. Therefore, the order of the factor group is equal to the index of the subgroup in the direct product.

Now, our field extension becomes Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), 3*sqrt(3)) over Q. Notice that the element 3*sqrt(3) is already in terms of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3).

For sqrt(2), we have one irreducible polynomial (x^2 - 2). Similarly, for sqrt(3) and sqrt(18), we also have one irreducible polynomial each (x^2 - 3 and x^2 - 18 respectively).

Statement 2 claims that if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is field. This is also true because if I is a maximal ideal, then the quotient ring R/I has no proper ideals (other than {0} and R/I itself).

This statement is also true because subrings are ideals in rings.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In group theory, a permutation is a bijective function that rearranges elements of a set. A cycle, on the other hand, is a sequence of distinct elements where each element except for the last one is replaced by its successor in the sequence.

Conversely, every cycle is also a permutation because it rearranges elements of a set. Therefore, Statement 2 is also true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both permutations and cycles involve rearranging elements. Therefore, every permutation must be a cycle, and every cycle must be a permutation. Hence, both statements are true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given a field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. To find the degree of this extension, we need to determine how many elements there are in the extension field.

Now, consider the set {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} where sqrt(6) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(3).

B,"Let's reason step by step. A finite field, denoted as Z_p for a prime number p, is a set of integers modulo p that forms a field under addition and multiplication operations. The generator in this context refers to an element g in the field such that every non-zero element can be expressed as a power of g (i.e., g^k mod p for some integer k). In Z_11, we are looking for a generator that satisfies these conditions. One possible choice is 2, since it has a multiplicative order of 10 in Z_11 (i.e., 2^1=2, 2^2=4, ..., 2^10=1).

A,"Let's reason step by step. In abstract algebra, a cyclic subgroup is one that can be generated by a single element. For instance, in the group Z_24 (integers modulo 24), the set {0,18,36} generates a cyclic subgroup of order 3. To find the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 18 in Z_24, we need to determine how many times 18 must be added to itself before reaching zero (mod 24).

In dihedral groups, the set of rotations form a cyclic subgroup because any rotation can be expressed as a power of a single rotation. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given condition states that for all a \\in A, g(f(a)) = a. This implies that the composition of functions f and g is an identity function on set A. Now, let's examine Statement 1: 'The function f must necessarily be injective.' An injective function ensures that no two distinct elements in its domain map to the same element in its codomain. Since the composition of injective functions is also injective (proof by contradiction), we can conclude that if g(f(a)) = a for all a \\in A, then f must be injective.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The given condition implies that every element in A has a pre-image in B under f, so f must be surjective. Now let's consider the function g: B -> A.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The symmetric group S_n, for n = 7, is the set of all permutations on a set with 7 elements. An element's order in a group refers to the smallest positive integer 'k' such that the element raised to the power of 'k' equals the identity element of the group. For any permutation in S_n, its maximum possible order can be found by considering the cycle decomposition of the permutation. The length of the longest cycle in a permutation determines its maximum possible order. In this case, we are looking for the maximum possible order for an element of S_7.

In this case, since the order of the element is 10, which is the product of 2, 5, and 1 (since 10 = 2 * 5), it follows that there must be elements with these orders in the group. Statement 2 claims that if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it must have an element of order 6. This is true because the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group itself.

Both statements seem to be true based on the properties of integral domains and their characteristics. In an integral domain with characteristic 0 (like the integers), it is impossible for the set to be finite because there would have to exist a non-zero element that has no multiplicative inverse, which contradicts the definition of an integral domain.

Symmetry is not satisfied because there are pairs in ~ that do not have their reverse pair present. For example, (1, 2) but not (2, 1).

A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is a well-known result in group theory that deals with the order of subgroup products. It's important to note that this statement does not necessarily hold for all groups; it requires H and K to be normal subgroups or to satisfy certain conditions. Statement 2, on the other hand, is a more specific claim about the structure of a group G with order 2p, where p is an odd prime number. This statement suggests that such a group must either be cyclic (i.e., it has a single generator) or isomorphic to D_p (the dihedral group of order 2p).",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Next, note that since sqrt(2) is already in the extension, its square root, -sqrt(2), must also be included to ensure closure under multiplication. Similarly, since sqrt(3) is already in the extension, its square root, -sqrt(3), must also be included. Finally, observe that none of these new elements can be expressed as a linear combination of the original elements (i.e., 1 and sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)).

Thus, it is possible for a homomorphism to have an empty kernel (e.g., the trivial homomorphism). On the other hand, if we consider nontrivial homomorphisms between some finite group and some infinite group, then it is not possible to have such a homomorphism because the image of any homomorphism must be a subgroup of the target algebraic structure. Since an infinite group cannot contain a finite subgroup (except for the trivial subgroup), this contradicts our assumption that there exists a nontrivial homomorphism between some finite group and some infinite group.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Homomorphisms can have empty kernels, and it's impossible to have a non-trivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group, so the first statement is true, and the second is false. Therefore, the correct answer is True, False.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Eisenstein criterion states that a polynomial P(x) = a_nx^n + ... + a_1x + a_0 with integer coefficients is irreducible over Q if there exists a prime number p such that: (1) p divides each of the coefficients a_i except for a_0 and a_n, (2) p^2 does not divide a_0 or a_n. In our case, P(x) = x^2 - 12. We can see that 2 is a prime number that satisfies condition (1), as it divides both coefficients except for the constant terms. However, 2^2 does not divide either of the constant terms (-12 and 0). Therefore, according to the Eisenstein criterion, P(x) = x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Eisenstein criterion doesn't seem to apply to the polynomial x^2 - 12, so it's not irreducible over Q. However, we can check if it's irreducible modulo each prime number less than or equal to its square root. In this case, the square root of 12 is approximately 3.46, so we only need to consider primes p=2 and p=3. We find that x^2 - 12 ≡ (x-2)(x+6) mod 2 and x^2 - 12 ≡ (x-3)(x-3) mod 3. Since neither of these congruences results in a product of two non-constant polynomials, the Eisenstein criterion doesn't hold for this polynomial with either p=2 or p=3. Therefore, we can conclude that the polynomial x^2 - 12 is not irreducible over Q.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 states that in a group, (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}. This is true because both sides of the equation represent the inverse of ab squared, which is equivalent to the product of a's and b's inverses taken twice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since groups are closed under multiplication and inverses, it follows that (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2} and (ab)^n = a^nb^n for any elements a and b in the group. Hence, both statements are true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In the ring Z_26, we are asked to compute the product of (20)(-8)). First, let's simplify these numbers modulo 26: 20 mod 26 = 4 and -8 mod 26 = 18. Now, multiply these simplified numbers: (4)(18) = 72. Finally, find the remainder when dividing by 26: 72 mod 26 = 10. Therefore, the product in Z_26 is 10.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Multiplying 20 and -8 gives -160, which corresponds to 11 in Z_26. This is because we are working modulo 26, so any number greater than or equal to 26 will be reduced to its remainder when divided by 26.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is about the existence of a free abelian group for every positive integer rank. This statement is true because we can construct such groups using the integers themselves as generators and their standard addition operation.,A,"Let's reason step by step. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if its Betti number is equal to the number of elements in some generating set, so both statements are true. Statement 1 states that there exists a free abelian group of every positive integer rank, which is also true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In this problem, we are looking for elements c in Z_3 such that the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field. A necessary and sufficient condition for a quotient ring to be a field is that its ideal (in this case, generated by x^3 + x^2 + c)) must be maximal. In other words, there should not exist any non-zero polynomial p(x) in Z_3[x] such that p(x)(x^3 + x^2 + c) = 0. This condition can be checked by directly computing the discriminant of the cubic polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c and ensuring it is non-zero in Z_3.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since Z_3 is a field, Z_3[x] is a Euclidean domain, and therefore, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field for any c in Z_3. To find all such c's, we need to solve the equation x^3 + x^2 + c = 0 over Z_3. However, this cubic equation does not have a simple solution. Instead, we can check each element of Z_3 (i.e., 0, 1, and 2) to see if it satisfies the equation. After checking all elements, we find that only c = 1 makes the quotient ring a field.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is about any set of two vectors in R^2 being linearly independent. This statement is true because if there were a linear combination that equals zero, then at least one vector would be redundant and not necessary for spanning the space. Therefore, this statement holds true. Statement 2 talks about the dimension of a subspace V when it's spanned by a set of linearly independent vectors {v1, ..., vk}. This statement is also true because the number of linearly independent vectors in a basis for V is equal to the dimension of V (i.e., dim(V) = k). Hence, this statement holds true as well.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since any two non-zero vectors in R^2 are linearly independent, both statements are true. Statement 1 confirms that any set of two vectors is indeed linearly independent. Statement 2 further supports this fact by stating that if a vector space V has a basis consisting of linearly independent vectors, then the dimension of V equals the number of vectors in the basis.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In abstract algebra, a factor group is obtained when we divide a group G by its normal subgroup N. The order of a factor group H = G/N is given by the formula |H| = |G| / |N|. In this case, Z_6 is a cyclic group of order 6, and <3> denotes the subgroup generated by the element 3 in Z_6. Since 3 generates the entire group Z_6 (because 3*2 = 6), we have that <3> = Z_6. Therefore, |Z_6/<3>| = |Z_6| / |Z_6| = 1. However, since we are looking for the order of a factor group and not the identity element, we must consider the original non-trivial subgroup <3>. In this case, |Z_6/<3>| = |Z_6| / |<3>| = 6 / 2 = 3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The factor group Z_6/<3> has order 2, as we are essentially dividing the group Z_6 into two cosets based on the multiples of 3. One coset is {0, 3}, and the other one is {1, 4}. These cosets partition the entire group Z_6, and thus have an order of 2.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Statement 1, we are given that dim(V) < dim(W) < 1. This is a contradiction because the dimension of a vector space must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, this statement cannot be true. In Statement 2, we are told that if T: V -> V is linear and injective, then it is a bijection. This statement is indeed true, as an injective linear transformation between two finite-dimensional vector spaces with equal dimensions must also be surjective (a bijection).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the dimension of the domain is less than the dimension of the codomain, the linear transformation cannot be injective, and therefore, it cannot be a bijection either. This contradicts Statement 2, which claims that if T is injective, then it must be a bijection. Therefore, we can conclude that both statements are false.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 talks about quotient rings of commutative rings being again commutative rings. This is a fundamental property of quotient rings and holds true for any commutative ring, making this statement true. Statement 2 discusses ideals N in a ring R with unity 1. It states that an ideal N is all of R if and only if 1 in N. This statement is also true because the definition of an ideal includes the condition that it must contain the multiplicative identity of the ring, which is why 1 in N implies that N is all of R.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since every commutative ring is a ring, and every quotient ring of a ring is again a ring, it follows that every quotient ring of a commutative ring is also commutative. Additionally, for an ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 to be equal to R, it must contain the unity 1. However, there are no restrictions on what elements can be contained within an ideal.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. This statement is true because the existence of one element of order 15 guarantees the presence of other elements with the same order through conjugation (i.e., applying group automorphisms). Statement 2 claims that if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. This statement is false because there exist groups with more than 8 elements of order 15 but fewer than 16 (e.g., the dihedral group D_30).",D,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 due to the existence of inverses and the closure property. Furthermore, if it has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 due to the structure of cyclic subgroups. Hence, both statements are true.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. This is true because if there were two distinct elements in the domain mapped to the same element in the codomain, then it wouldn't be a surjection (onto) anymore. Therefore, this statement holds true. Statement 2 talks about subgroups of an abelian group being abelian themselves. While this is generally true for any subgroup of an abelian group, there are exceptions where a non-trivial subgroup could be abelian even though the original group isn't. However, since we're not given specific examples or conditions, we can assume that this statement holds true as well.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since every function from a finite set onto itself is bijective, it must also be one-to-one. Similarly, every subgroup of an abelian group inherits the abelian property, making it abelian as well. In this case, both statements are true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A permutation is a one-to-one function that maps elements from a set to itself while preserving the order of distinct elements. On the other hand, every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one. Thus, both statements are true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Every permutation is a one-to-one function by definition. Additionally, every function that is one-to-one is also a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that Q is an extension field of Z_2. This statement is true because every finite field with p elements (where p is a prime number) can be constructed as an extension of the prime field Z_p, and in this case, we have p = 2. Statement 2 states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is also true because by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in the complex numbers C has at least one complex root. Since any finite field F can be embedded into its algebraic closure (which is an infinite extension of F), it follows that every non-constant polynomial over a finite field also has a zero in some extension field.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q contains elements that are not in Z_2, it is an extension field of Z_2. Moreover, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in that same field, as fields are algebraically closed. Therefore, the second statement holds true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 discusses the relationship between elements in a factor group and their orders. Specifically, it states that if aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. This statement is true because the order of any element in a group must divide the order of the group itself. In this case, since aH is a coset of H within G, its order cannot exceed the order of G. Therefore, |aH| divides |a|. Statement 2 discusses the product of two subgroups in a group. Specifically, it states that if H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G. This statement is true because the product of two subsets forms another subset under the same binary operation. In addition, the identity element of G belongs to both H and K, ensuring that HK contains an identity element. Furthermore, if a and b are elements in HK, then their products ab also belong to HK since H and K are closed under multiplication. Therefore, HK is indeed a subgroup of G.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Therefore, if aH is an element of a factor group, its order must divide the order of a. Additionally, the product of any two subgroups H and K of a group G is always a subgroup of G. This confirms that Statement 2 is true.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that if G, H and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them must be isomorphic. This statement is true because there exist exactly three non-isomorphic groups of order 4: the cyclic group Z_4, the Klein four-group V_4, and the direct product Z_2 x Z_2. Therefore, at least two of these groups must be isomorphic. Statement 2 claims that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement is true because the direct sum of cyclic groups Z_r + Z_s can be identified with the quotient group (Z x Z) / {(r, 0), (0, s)} which is isomorphic to Z_(lcm(r, s)) x Z_(gcd(r, s))). Therefore, r divides lcm(r, s) and s divides gcd(r, s)).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic. Additionally, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n due to the properties of direct sums. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are asked to factor the polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x]. First, we need to find roots of this polynomial modulo 5. The polynomial can be rewritten as (x^2)^2 + 4 = x^4 - 1. Now, let's look for a root r such that r^4 = 1 mod 5. We can check that (-1)^4 = 1 and (0)^4 = 0 mod 5. So, we have two roots: r_1 = -1 and r_2 = 0 in Z_5[x]. Now, let's factor the polynomial using these roots. The polynomial factors as follows: (x + 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + 1). Since x^2 + 1 can be factored further into linear factors over Z_5, we have our final factorization: (x + 1)(x - 1)((x + 2)(x - 2)).",A,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite x^4 + 4 as (x^4 - 1) + 5, which factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + 5. In Z_5, this further simplifies to (x-1)^3(x+1) due to the properties of modular arithmetic. Hence, the factorization of x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x] is (x-1)^3(x+1).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given condition states that for all a \\in A, g(f(a)) = a. This implies that the composition of functions f and g is an identity function on set A. Now, let's examine Statement 1: 'The function g must necessarily be injective.' An injective function ensures that distinct elements in its domain are mapped to distinct elements in its codomain. Since the composition of two functions (f and g) is injective if and only if f is injective, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means that g 'undoes' the action of f, implying that g must be both injective and surjective. Injectivity ensures that no two distinct elements in B are mapped to the same element in A. Surjectivity guarantees that every element in A is mapped to at least one element in B. Therefore, both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are true.",A
