D,"Let's reason step by step. A deterministic Turing machine is fully determined by its configuration, so the computation path is unique for a given input. Thus, we can decide if the computation lasts for at least n steps by simply running the machine for n steps and checking the state after n steps.

For part III, we need to scan distinct squares, so we can decide this by running the machine and counting the number of squares scanned.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

The maximum throughput of a pipeline is determined by the number of stages in the pipeline, so M-7, with 7 stages, will have higher throughput than M-5, despite having a longer clock cycle. However, the latency per instruction is influenced by both the number of stages and clock cycle duration. Since M-7 has fewer stages but a shorter clock cycle, its latency per instruction will be lower. This contradicts statement III, so we can conclude that it is false. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since M-7 has more pipeline stages, it takes less time for each individual instruction to complete, resulting in shorter latency.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The bus is shared between processors, and each processor has a cache memory. On average, 1% of references result in a cache miss, which takes an additional 2000 nanoseconds, divided into two halves. During the first half, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache-miss request, and during the second half, the processor cannot execute but the bus is free for other processors. Each instruction has 2 references on average, so a single processor would consume (1/50) * (1/2) = 1/50 of the bus capacity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since cache misses occur on 1% of references and cause a 2,000 nanosecond delay, the bus usage by a single processor would be 0.01 * 2,000 = 20 nanoseconds per instruction.

While III describes the idea of having shorter proofs for unsatifiable formulas, it does not imply that all such proofs will be polynomial in length, just that some may be.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Logic programs are a way to represent rules and clauses, and the evaluation strategy defines how these rules and clauses are executed on a sequential machine. All options (I, II, and III) are necessary for a complete evaluation strategy as they define different aspects of rule execution.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Executing a logic program requires determining the order of rules and clauses to be evaluated, but the order of arguments within each clause doesn't affect the execution. So, only options I and II are necessary for successful execution.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The grammar given has a set of production rules that can generate strings with 'x', 'y', and 'z' but not 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The only option that doesn't include any of these letters is 'D', which can be generated by the string 'xxxxy'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The grammar allows for the generation of strings like 'xxzy' because 'E' can produce 'z', and 'D' can produce 'Ey', leading to a sequence of 'x's followed by 'zy'. However, the string 'xxxxy' is not possible as the production rule for 'D' does not allow for an extra 'x'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The time required for a file read operation in the NoNicks OS has four components, and we're interested in the ratio of times for reading large files under two versions with different block sizes. Version 1 uses 1000-byte blocks, and version 2 uses 4000-byte blocks. The disk seek time and latency remain constant, while the transfer time reduces by a factor of 4 (4000/1000 = 4). The operating system overhead also reduces by a factor of 4. So, the ratio is (original / new) = (1 + 1 + 1/4 + 1/4) = 3/2 = 1.5. So, the correct answer is option D: 1.5.",D,"Let's reason step by step. By quadrupling the block size, we reduce the number of blocks to be read by a factor of 4, leading to a 4 times faster read time in version 2 compared to version 1. Therefore, the ratio is 1:4.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The loop performs 256 iterations, and each iteration requires reading from Array A, performing an operation, and writing the result back to Array A. Since the cache size is 2KB (2^11 bytes), it can hold up to 2048 bytes (2^(11-3)) of data for a 3-way set-associative cache with a block size of 8 bytes. In this case, only one cache line needs to be written back to memory since the loop writes 256 bytes in total.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With a write-back policy, modifications are initially stored in the cache and written back to memory later. Considering the loop iterations and data access patterns, a significant amount of data (around 2000 bytes) will be written back to memory. This is because each element of Array A is 4 bytes, and there are 256 elements being modified, resulting in 1024 bytes of write operations. However, since the cache size is only 2000 bytes, all writes will be performed, and no data will be evicted during the loop.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. For the given problems, I and III can be solved with a greedy approach as they involve finding a path or flow in a graph with positive weights. In problem I, we want to find a path that connects all vertices with minimal weight, which can be achieved by always choosing the edge with the smallest weight. Problem II is more complex as it deals with finding the maximum number of vertices that can be connected while satisfying certain conditions, which might require backtracking or other techniques beyond a simple greedy approach.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A greedy algorithm can work well for problems like finding a maximum clique because it iteratively selects the best local option, leading to a globally optimal solution. For problem III, we can also use a greedy approach, as it ensures that we always choose the most beneficial edge to increase flow, resulting in an optimal solution.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stack-based storage allocation is commonly used for recursive procedures as it allows for proper function call stack frame management, enabling proper function return and maintaining local variable state.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Two-dimensional arrays require dynamic memory allocation and deallocation during runtime, which necessitates the use of a stack for efficient management. This is because two-dimensional arrays have variable-length dimensions that need to be stored and accessed dynamically.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. For a connected graph, the degree of every vertex is at least 1, and the total number of edges is at least the number of vertices minus one. Thus, if the degree of every vertex is even, the graph must have an even number of vertices, which implies that the number of edges is greater than or equal to the number of vertices minus one.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If a graph has at least one vertex with degree 1, it means it has at least two distinct connected components. The number of edges in a connected component is always equal to the number of vertices plus the number of edges between them, which is why |E| \u2265 |V| - 1 is true for any connected graph. Therefore, both I and II are true.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Direct mapping has a simple structure, but it can lead to conflicts when multiple tags map to the same block, reducing the cache hit ratio.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Direct mapping involves accessing data from memory, which inherently takes more time than accessing data directly from registers. Therefore, the main disadvantage of direct mapping is increased access time compared to other cache organization methods.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The number of states in a DFA is at least the number of possible configurations of the number of 0s and 1s, which is at most 2 * k (since each position can be either 0 or 1), so the minimum number of states is 2k.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since we have two possible input symbols, 0 and 1, and the DFA needs to track the count of both, the total number of states should be proportional to the square of the number of symbols. The minimum number of states required is k^2.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The loop performs 256 iterations, and each iteration requires reading from Array A and Array B, performing an addition, and writing the result back to Array A. Since the cache size is 2 KB (2048 bytes), and each element is 4 bytes, we can fit 512 elements (512 * 4 bytes = 2048 bytes) in the cache. After the loop starts executing, the first 256 elements of Array A are already in the cache. During the loop, the first 128 elements of Array B will be loaded into the cache as well (up to index 256). This results in a total of 256 + 128 = 384 bytes written to memory. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With a write-through policy, every write operation updates both the cache and the main memory simultaneously, so there's no need for additional writes after the loop. Therefore, no extra bytes will be written to memory.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Round-robin scheduling ensures that each job gets a fair share of the processor, and no job is indefinitely delayed or starved. Thus, it is starvation-free.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'shortest job first' policy prioritizes jobs with the shortest execution time, ensuring that no job is left waiting for an unreasonable amount of time. This policy guarantees that no job will be starved for service as the shortest jobs are always given priority.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A complete set of Boolean operators includes all possible combinations of AND, OR, and NOT. The given sets do not include NAND or NOR, which are valid Boolean operations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The NAND operator is a universal gate, meaning it can be used to implement any Boolean function, so it should be sufficient on its own. However, the set {AND, NOT} is not complete because it cannot represent the OR function. Therefore, option D is incorrect.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A context-free grammar is a formal language used to define a set of strings, typically used in programming languages to specify syntax. Identifier length and type compatibility are not inherently string-based, while operator precedence and nesting levels can be defined using CFGs but are not their primary focus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Type compatibility rules determine how different data types can be used together in expressions and assignments, which aligns with the capabilities of context-free grammars. Identifier length and maximum nesting level are both syntactic features that can be defined by context-sensitive grammars, while operator precedence is a semantic rule.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. If Mary asks a yes/no question, she can eliminate half the numbers with each answer. With an optimal strategy, she will need to ask at most log_2(1000) = 9 questions to determine the number.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In the worst case, Mary would have to ask about each number one by one until she finds the correct one, requiring 999 questions. This is the maximum number of questions needed as asking more questions will only lead to further confusion.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The hash function h(x) = x mod 4 maps each integer to one of four buckets. The sequence of perfect squares is i^2, so the first few terms are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ... Each number will hash to a different bucket, and as the number of entries grows, all four buckets will be filled. Therefore, option B is correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of entries grows, the distribution of perfect squares modulo 4 will likely favor certain buckets, leading to a growing difference in the number of entries per bucket. This is due to the periodic nature of the modulo operation.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The number of functions mapping A into B is given by the combination of choosing m elements from n, which can be calculated as n! / (n-m)!. This is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since each element in A can be mapped to any of the n elements in B, and the order of mapping matters, the total number of functions should be n!. However, we need to account for the fact that some functions may not be valid due to having less than m elements in A. Therefore, we divide by (n - m)! to get the correct answer.",B

Only I and III can be true simultaneously.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Checking for an even number of true variables involves counting and comparing, which can be expressed using combinations of AND and OR operations. The condition 'At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true' can be represented by the disjunction of all possible combinations that satisfy this condition, ensuring at least one of the variables is true.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that requires dividing the list into halves, sorting them recursively, and then merging them back together. An array allows for efficient access to elements, making it possible to divide the list into halves in O(n) time. Recursion and merging take O(n log n) time. Therefore, merge sort works with arrays in O(n log n) time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Merging two sorted lists efficiently requires random access to elements, which is only possible with arrays, not linked lists.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The given function T(n) is a recursive relation that can be solved using master theorem for divide and conquer algorithms. The ratio of consecutive terms approaches 3, which is less than the threshold for the case of quadratic time complexity (ratio > 2). Therefore, the growth order is linear, O(n).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The recursive calls within the function definition suggest a logarithmic factor, leading to an overall order of growth of O(n^2 log n).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aggressive pipelining is a technique used in CPU design to improve performance by allowing multiple instructions to be executed simultaneously. Option A is not an obstacle as condition codes are simple and do not impact the pipeline. Variable-length encoding (option B) can be handled with proper alignment, and options C and D do not inherently prevent pipelining.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Variable-length instructions require additional processing to determine their boundaries and align them properly, hindering efficient pipelining. Condition codes set by every instruction are not a significant obstacle as they can be handled with proper pipeline control. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can cause stalling, but modern processors use techniques like dynamic instruction ordering to mitigate this. While several different classes of registers exist, they don't inherently hinder aggressive pipelining.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A hash table is a data structure that maps words to boolean values, indicating whether a word is in the dictionary or not.

The size of the hash table doesn't matter here as long as it can accommodate the words in the document.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking. Additionally, as the number of words in the dictionary increases, it may be necessary to increase the size of the hash table to accommodate more entries, supporting statement III.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The microcomputer needs to process and output the average of four analog signals in real-time, with a maximum delay of 12 microseconds per signal digitization. For this, it must execute 5 instructions for each signal, and then another 10 instructions to average and output the data. By considering the given values and operations, we can calculate the maximum instruction execution time as 12 microseconds * 5 instructions/signal + 10 instructions = 80 microseconds. Dividing this by the number of signals gives us the maximum average instruction execution time of 80 microseconds / 4 signals = 20 microseconds per signal. Therefore, the final answer is B: 1.2 microseconds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. For four samples, we need 5 instructions per sample * 4 samples = 20 instructions. This means the max time is (12 microseconds/sample - 20 instructions) / 10 instructions = 1.6 microseconds.",C
