D,"Let's reason step by step. Impulse goods are products that consumers buy without much planning or thought, often on a whim. They are usually consumed quickly and are not essential for daily life. This description fits with items like candy and toys, which are bought infrequently but used repeatedly. Luxury goods are items that provide status or pleasure but are not necessary for basic needs, so they are purchased sparingly despite their high cost. Durable goods are long-lasting products like furniture or cars, which are frequently bought but not often used in a single session. Non-durable goods are perishable and need to be replaced regularly, like groceries or toiletries, and don't carry much status or pleasure. So, the correct answer is A: Impulse goods.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Luxury goods are typically purchased infrequently, involve significant investment, and carry a higher risk due to their exclusivity and price. They are also used repeatedly as they are considered desirable and valuable items.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Consumer segmentation is a marketing strategy that groups consumers into categories based on specific attributes.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Market equivalence and functional equivalence are both types of market research equivalences that focus on the performance and effectiveness of products or services across different markets, while conceptual equivalence refers to the alignment of product concepts and ideas.

This scenario exemplifies GAP 3, where there's a discrepancy between the defined service quality standards and the actual service delivery. The train operator has failed to translate the customer's desire for comfortable seats into a measurable and actionable standard for the number of seats to be provided. This gap can lead to dissatisfaction among travelers.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Word-of-mouth (WOM) communication refers to informal conversations between individuals about a product or service. WOM implies that the communicator is not trying to sell anything directly, as it relies on personal experiences and opinions. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Word of Mouth (WOM).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Personal selling involves direct, interpersonal communication between a salesperson and a potential customer, with the goal of persuading the customer to purchase a product or service. The salesperson is seen as an expert and a trusted advisor, providing information and guidance to help the customer make an informed decision. This form of communication is often used for complex or high-value products where customers seek personalized attention and advice.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'experience economy' refers to an economic concept where the creation and delivery of experiences, often unique and personalized, are valued by consumers.

In this case, once a train/plane leaves or a film starts, those seats are no longer available for sale as they are integral to the experience.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Inseparability refers to the characteristic of services where production and consumption happen at the same time, meaning that the service cannot be separated from the provider and the customer. Once the service is delivered, it cannot be stored or resold. This perfectly describes the situation with a train or plane seat that has been taken by a passenger; once occupied, it cannot be sold to another person.",A

D,"Let's reason step by step. Price competitiveness, price assurance, and price guarantee schemes are strategies that provide customers with peace of mind regarding pricing. Reference prices, on the other hand, are typically used to influence customer behavior and perceived value, but may not directly convey information about the company's competitive pricing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Price competitiveness refers to a company's strategy of setting prices at or below the market average to attract customers and gain market share. Price assurance is a promise by a company to meet or beat a competitor's price, which is not the same as actually being competitive. Reference prices are suggested retail prices set by manufacturers, which don't directly indicate actual sales prices. Price guarantee schemes refer to policies where a company guarantees a certain price for a product or service, which is also not the same as price competitiveness. Thus, price competitiveness directly implies providing customers with peace of mind that the company's prices are competitive and attractive.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. Warehouses are designed to store goods for extended periods, whether it's perishable items or bulk commodities. Distribution centers facilitate the flow of goods but don't necessarily hold them for long-term storage, while haulage transport is short-term and electronic data interchange is digital.",A,"Let's reason step by step.
