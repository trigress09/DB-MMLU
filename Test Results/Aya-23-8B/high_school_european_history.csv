C,"Let's reason step by step. Herbert Spencer, in the quoted passage, advocates for a form of social welfare and intervention to alleviate poverty and distress while maintaining individual freedom. These ideas align with Liberalism, which emphasizes individual freedom and limited government intervention. Thus, the correct answer is C: Liberalism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's strong opposition to government involvement in social welfare and his focus on individual liberty suggest a belief in minimal state control, aligning with anarchist principles. Anarchism advocates for the absence of forced or hierarchic organization, which matches Spencer's view that the state should not enforce 'satisfaction' but rather respect individual freedom.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes William Morris' strong dislike for modern civilization and his hope for its destruction, which suggests that he had dedicated himself to a cause that opposed the status quo. This is most aligned with the option 'socialism', as it was the time when socialism was gaining traction as an alternative to capitalism and industrialism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's disdain for the negative consequences of industrialization and his embrace of socialism suggest a vision of a society with advanced mechanical power driving progress. This indicates a preference for the spread of mechanical power in industry, option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'negotiations with the Tories', which refers to political negotiations between the Conservative Party and the Queen, indicating a transition in government or policy-making. This suggests that the historical transition mentioned is the switch from a liberal-dominated to a conservative-dominated Parliament.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to negotiations with the Tories and Queen Victoria's active involvement in political discussions suggest a transition towards a more female-centric political landscape. While the text does not explicitly state this, it implies that the power dynamics within the British government are shifting, potentially indicating a change from male-dominated politics to female-dominated politics.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Hernan Cortez's letter to Emperor Charles V, in which he explains his actions against the Indian people. He mentions that he burned the 'culprit', indicating a legal system and punishment for murder, and also states his intent to teach them about Christianity and submission to the emperor, suggesting a religious and political framework. The text does not mention any technological advancements specifically, but it implies that the Europeans had superior weapons (cannon) and ships (carracks and caravels), which were crucial for their success in conquering the New World.",C,"Let's reason step by step. European dominance in exploration was largely facilitated by superior shipbuilding technology, enabling them to navigate vast distances and establish trade routes with the New World. This allowed for the exchange of goods, knowledge, and ideas, which ultimately led to their success.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was a non-aggression agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. This pact is similar to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, as both involve two powers forming an alliance to balance out potential threats from other countries. While the Sykes-Picot Agreement was made during World War I, it set up a system of control over the Middle East, which could be seen as a way to balance power and prevent one country from gaining too much influence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The agreement's focus on preventing conflict between Germany and the USSR through non-aggression resembles the appeasement strategy employed in the Munich Agreement to avoid war with Germany. However, the Munich Agreement specifically involved a territorial trade-off, whereas this agreement emphasizes consultation and mutual support against third parties, indicating a more complex arrangement.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a peace treaty that ended the Eastern Front of World War I between the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria) and Russia. Article III specifically mentions that the western territories formerly belonging to Russia would no longer be under Russian sovereignty, indicating a transfer of territory to another power. This suggests an exchange of territories between Germany and Russia, with Germany gaining western territories from Russia, leading to option B being the most accurate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's stipulations regarding territories previously under Russian control and the establishment of a Russo-German commission suggest a transfer of land from the western part of the German Empire to the Russian Empire. This is indicated in Article III, which states that the territories lying west of the agreed-upon line will no longer be subject to Russian sovereignty.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the 1848 revolutions in Germany failed to bring about significant changes in the ruling class or ideology, demonstrating that 'nothing remained but the idea of Force'. This suggests that the revolutions had a limited impact on the political structure and ideology, which is the opposite of what liberal ideas promote.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's emphasis on the revolutions' failure to bring about significant change suggests that the existing power structures and ruling class remained largely unaffected, despite the upheaval. This interpretation aligns with the claim that the revolutions 'discredited conservative ideas' and 'liberal ideas', indicating a shift in focus from idealistic change to more practical, force-driven approaches.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a story from Voltaire's 'Candide', where the protagonist, Pangloss, endures various misfortunes and encounters. These events are not necessarily indicative of a specific theme or philosophical school. While the passage mentions the 'pre-established harmony' and 'materia subtilis', which could align with rationalism, it also involves elements of empiricism (Pangloss's change in opinion after being rescued) and romanticism (the emphasis on adventure and the role of fate/destiny).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pangloss's reliance on personal anecdotes and his persistent belief in the inherent goodness of the world, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, reflect an empirical approach to understanding reality. This is a key characteristic of empiricism, where knowledge is derived from direct experience and observation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's speech emphasizes the need for a unified, advanced industrial base to support the Soviet regime and socialist construction. This is in contrast to the scattered and backward small-scale agriculture of the peasants. Stalin's policies aimed to collectivize agriculture (A), persecute those deemed wealthy (B), block Berlin (C), or implement five-year plans for rapid industrialization and collectivization (D). While these policies addressed the issue of uneven development, they do not directly address the need for a unified industrial base as emphasized by Lenin. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it directly contradicts Lenin's vision of a unified industrial basis for defense and socialism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Collectivization, involving the forced consolidation of small farms into larger collective units, was not a strategy employed by Stalin to address the issues of agricultural inefficiency and backwardness. Persecution of the better-off peasants and the Berlin blockade are also not correct answers as they do not directly address the issue of industrial development. The five-year plans, while not directly addressing agriculture, were a key initiative to rapidly industrialize the Soviet Union, aligning with Lenin's vision.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system where indigenous people were forced into labor for the Spanish conquistadors, with gold and women being used as incentives or rewards. This was an abusive system that was protested against by missionaries due to its exploitation of native peoples. While land availability and direct control by the crown are also factors in the decline of the system, they do not directly address the core issue of forced labor, which is addressed in option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The encomienda system's gradual decline can be attributed primarily to the Spanish crown's increasing desire to exert direct control over the American colonies and their resources, bypassing the intermediary encomenderos. This is indicated by the text's mention of the crown's 'desire to control the estates more directly'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a hypothetical situation where children of wealthy families would typically show interest in manual labor if not for the unsavory conditions and lack of refinement associated with such occupations. This aligns with utopian socialist ideals, which aim to create an egalitarian society through shared work and common ownership of the means of production.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fourier's belief in the importance of individual passions and his critique of societal restrictions on personal fulfillment suggest an affinity for laissez-faire capitalism, which promotes individual liberty and minimal government interference. However, he also advocates for collective action to improve society as a whole, which aligns with socialism. Therefore, Fourier would likely be categorized as a utopian socialist.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text is an excerpt from a work by Nicolas Copernicus, a 16th-century astronomer who proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system, challenging the geocentric model prevalent at the time. This excerpt discusses the spherical nature of the Earth and its relationship to the universe, which aligns with the scientific method and empirical observation, characteristic of the Scientific Revolution, rather than philosophical or magical traditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's emphasis on the Earth's spherical shape and his exploration of the possibility of a heliocentric model align with the Aristotelian tradition, which provided the foundation for understanding the natural world. While he engaged with other philosophical traditions, his work primarily fell within the Aristotelian framework.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas' text describes the Spanish colonization of the Americas and how they treated the indigenous people brutally, killing and torturing them for their gold and land. This indicates that de las Casas believes financial gain is the primary motive for exploration in this context.",B,Let's reason step by step. De las Casas's strong criticism of Spanish cruelty and his depiction of the suffering inflicted upon the indigenous population suggest a belief that the primary motive for exploration was to find new mates for the Spanish colonists. This is further supported by the fact that de las Casas mentions the destruction of the native population as a result of the Spanish pursuit of gold and wealth.,D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that 1848 was a pivotal year in German history, and it is relevant to understand its significance as we approach the end of WWII. Option A is the most appropriate choice as it acknowledges the historical context and the potential for analysis of Germany's past behavior.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Taylor's analysis of the 1848 revolutions, written in the context of 1945 and the aftermath of World War II, suggests a focus on understanding the origins of the Cold War and the ideological conflicts that shaped the post-war world. The answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ended World War I for Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey against Russia. It was a result of the Bolsheviks' need to focus on consolidating their power within Russia and ending their involvement in the war, which is indicated as the primary motivation for the treaty.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, involving Russia and Germany, can be seen as a direct consequence of the fracturing of the Triple Entente, as alliances shifted and power dynamics changed during World War I. This treaty was a result of the Bolsheviks' desire to end the war and focus on consolidating their revolutionary gains, which is the most plausible option.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the belief in a 'unique German mission' was initially supported by Germans, who claimed a special path for their nation. After World War II, this perspective shifted to criticism of Germany's deviation from the West, indicating that the belief was not proven correct or discredited by the war but rather evolved based on changing interpretations of history.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of Germany having a unique historical mission emerged in response to the nation's defeat in World War II, as Germans sought to explain their country's trajectory and its deviation from the West. This belief was later criticized and discredited after the war, indicating that it was indeed influenced by Germany's defeat.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's entry from 1802 suggests that his power was directly linked to his military victories, which brought him glory and reputation. This implies that he believed that continued conquests were necessary to maintain his hold on power, as his reputation and power were built on his past successes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's relentless pursuit of conquest and his focus on maintaining his reputation suggest a primary motivation to earn the admiration and loyalty of his soldiers, who played a crucial role in his military successes. This is evident in his entry from 1802, where he acknowledges that 'Conquest has made me what I am'.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'the final result' of Metternich's negotiations, which suggests that it refers to the outcome of his efforts during the Congress of Vienna. This event led to the establishment or reinforcement of certain political alliances and agreements among European monarchs, which is consistent with option C, referring to Metternich's statement about the unity of monarchs and the creation of the Concert of Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's strong opposition to secret societies and his emphasis on maintaining social order directly resulted in the implementation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which aimed to suppress revolutionary movements and dissent. This was a direct action taken to counter the spread of revolutionary ideas and maintain the status quo.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon is known for his intellectual prowess, with a vast understanding of various fields. His conversations showcase a deep knowledge of multiple subjects, including history, politics, and philosophy. This excerpt specifically mentions his insights on the French Revolution and its international impact, indicating a broad understanding of political matters.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's conquests and the subsequent dissemination of French language and culture throughout Europe played a significant role in making the French Revolution an international movement, spreading its ideals and principles to other nations. This had a profound impact on the development of modern democracy and human rights movements worldwide.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's speech highlights his belief in the necessity of industrialization for the Soviet Union's survival and success, which suggests that his desire to industrialize was influenced by a combination of factors. While exile may have played a role, it is more likely that his understanding of the country's current state and its potential for improvement guided his decision. The text mentions that the Soviet Union needed an adequate industrial basis for defense, indicating that Lenin recognized the nation's current shortcomings and sought to address them through industrialization.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Trotsky's strategic control over vital infrastructure, such as rail and telegraph stations, during the Bolshevik Revolution heavily influenced Lenin's focus on industrialization as a means to strengthen the Soviet state and maintain power. This event was pivotal in shaping Lenin's policies and strategies for the new regime.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a person who, upon reading an announcement about the mobilization for war, feels exhilarated and excited, which suggests that they support the impending conflict. This indicates that they are likely enthusiastic about the prospect of war, supporting option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Doregelès mentions being 'dead tired but exhilarated,' which suggests a sense of nervous energy and worry about the potential consequences of war. The passage also mentions that Paris was 'singing,' indicating a sense of excitement and celebration, which might be due to the anticipation of adventure or the belief in their country's victory. Therefore, Doregelès likely shared in Paris' excitement and enthusiasm for the coming war, as it represented an opportunity for adventure and a chance to prove their nation's strength.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Edict of Nantes was a historic French decree issued by Henry IV in 1598 that granted religious tolerance to Protestants and established their right to worship freely, while also granting protection to the Catholic Church. This indicates that Henry IV wanted to maintain peace between the two religions and ensure they could coexist peacefully without interference or hindrance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Henry IV's edict clearly states the restoration of the Catholic Church, implying its superior position and truth compared to other religions. This suggests that he believed it to be the one true church.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the reactions to the Luddite movement, which was a reaction to industrialization and the introduction of new machinery that replaced manual labor. Before 1850, governments typically did not intervene heavily in such situations, as seen in this case with the government taking no action despite the complaints. Additionally, the text mentions the improvement of working conditions through regulations on work hours and ages, which further supports choice B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The government's response to industrialization issues often involved establishing social safety nets like healthcare systems to support displaced workers. While running water and sewers were introduced, they are not directly related to addressing the specific issue of industrialization's impact on workers. Reform movements aimed at improving working conditions but did not solely address the complaints mentioned in the poem.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' by Rudyard Kipling expresses a complex view of imperialism. It acknowledges the challenges and hardships of the imperial mission but also implies that it is a necessary burden to bear for the greater good. The speaker in the poem takes on the responsibility of bringing civilization and progress to the 'savage' peoples, despite the difficulties and potential setbacks. This suggests a sense of duty and a belief in the higher purpose of the imperial endeavor.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem uses phrases like 'heavy harness' and 'sullen peoples,' indicating a belief in the need for forceful control and dominance over colonized populations. The poem also suggests that the imperial mission is fraught with challenges, but it is ultimately seen as necessary to bring civilization and progress to the 'savages'. This aligns with the idea of a difficult but crucial task.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes to Europe, including the development of new technologies, urbanization, and a shift from agrarian to manufacturing economies. While it led to increased productivity and economic growth, it also had negative consequences such as overcrowding in cities and labor issues. Therefore, the correct answer is option A, as it highlights that agricultural elites maintained their dominance even after the Industrial Revolution, indicating that social and economic inequalities persisted beyond this period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The formation of class identities through labor unions and shared experiences fostered a sense of solidarity and ultimately led to a more equitable distribution of wealth and power. While this was a result of the Industrial Revolution, it does not directly contradict the other statements, which describe more direct consequences of the revolution.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Herbert Spencer, in the quoted passage, advocates for a social philosophy that justifies state intervention to alleviate poverty and distress while preserving individual freedom. This aligns with the principles of Social Darwinism, which emphasizes survival of the fittest and can be applied to human society, justifying state action to ensure the 'survival' of those less fortunate while maintaining the freedom of others.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's argument against government intervention in poverty aligns with social conservatism's emphasis on individual responsibility and minimal state interference. He sees poverty as a natural consequence of individual choices, and the state's role is to ensure freedom while allowing natural selection to take its course.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that there was initially a positive view of a 'special German mission' and later a negative view after 1945, indicating a debate about the unique path Germany took. This suggests that the notion of a unique German path is not universally accepted and has been a subject of discussion among Germans for a long time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Winkler states that the negative view of a unique German path is now predominant, suggesting a settled consensus and an end to the debate. This indicates that the notion of a unique German path was not always accepted, but it has since been rejected in favor of a more unified European perspective.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that prior to 1945, there was a significant belief among Germans in a 'special' or 'unique' German mission in history, implying that they saw themselves as exceptional. This belief is referred to as a 'special mission' or 'unique path'. After 1945, this view changed, and the negative perception became predominant, with people recognizing that Germany was not unique compared to other great European nations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that educated Germans began criticizing the deviation from the West after 1945 suggests that there was little belief in a unique German path before that time. This indicates that option A is incorrect, and B is also unlikely as it would contradict the text's mention of 'significant belief'. Option C accurately reflects the historical perspective mentioned in the passage, and D is not mentioned, so it is the correct choice.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, expresses his belief that holding the current generation of Germans responsible for their ancestors' actions would continue to traumatize the living and prevent them from finding redemption. This suggests that he believes they have a responsibility to remember and learn from history, which is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wiesel clearly states that the current generation of Germans should not be judged for the crimes of the past, implying they have no responsibility regarding the Holocaust. He emphasizes their role in remembering and holding themselves accountable for how they remember the past, which suggests a shift of focus from collective guilt to individual responsibility.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Napoleon's intellect and knowledge, suggesting that he was a man of high intelligence and wisdom. The author seems to ignore his actions that contradicted these qualities, such as his invasion of Haiti, which involved the brutal suppression of a slave revolt. This action goes against the idea of a high-minded individual promoting freedom and equality.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author praises Napoleon's intellect and achievements, which likely includes his successful expansion of French influence through conquests and the Continental System. The invasion of Haiti was a failed expedition that resulted in the loss of many lives and further damaged France's reputation. Therefore, it is the most likely action that the author would view as hypocritical given their praise for Napoleon's genius.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a group of people, the 'Chartist', who were denouncing and threatening those who did not share their beliefs, which is indicative of a radical reformer's perspective. Radicals often advocate for more inclusive voting rights and are known for their passionate and sometimes aggressive campaigns.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author's disapproval of the Chartists' violent tactics and extreme rhetoric indicates agreement with their radical reformist objectives. However, they also express concern that the term 'Household Suffrage' may exclude a significant portion of the working class, suggesting a desire for more inclusive reform, which is not inherently radical. Thus, the author likely leans towards the center of the political spectrum.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, also known as the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, was an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union that included a secret protocol dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Article II specifically states that neither party will 'lend its support' to a third belligerent power, which is exactly what Germany did when it invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, breaking the pact.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Operation Barbarossa, as a surprise attack, represents a failure to maintain contact and exchange information as stipulated in Article III of the pact. This article emphasizes ongoing communication between the two parties for mutual benefit and conflict resolution. By violating this article, Germany showed a disregard for peaceful relations and mutual understanding, leading to the outbreak of war.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the influence of Byzantine scholarship and the debate over Plato vs. Aristotle, which aligns with the topic of cultural diffusion. The answer is likely a text that reflects this exchange of ideas between Eastern and Western thought, specifically focusing on Plato.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of Platonism during the Renaissance, as described by Russell, likely influenced the development of literary works like Boccaccio's Decameron. This work is known for its exploration of human nature and society through a series of stories, reflecting the humanist ideals of the time.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that 'the Christian has been the most intolerant', which contradicts the quote's message of mutual pardon and tolerance. This suggests that the author, Voltaire, may not have held the same belief as the quote implies, indicating a potential contradiction in his views or an emphasis on the contrast between Christian intolerance and the ideal of tolerance. Thus, the correct answer is that Voltaire did not believe in tolerance, which is represented by 'C'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of Christian intolerance suggests a rejection of religion altogether, aligning with atheistic beliefs. This indicates that he was an atheist, supporting choice A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was a non-aggression agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, which allowed both countries to invade Poland without fear of retaliation from each other. Poland was the common target of these two powers, and their invasion led to World War II.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact's emphasis on peace between Germany and the USSR implies permission for both nations to pursue expansionist policies in other regions, such as Finland. Finland was a common target of Soviet and German aggression during World War II, with the latter supporting Finnish nationalists in their attempt to secede from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Thus, the correct answer is Finland.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the motivations and actions of Francisco Pizarro, a Spanish conquistador who led the conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century. He was known for his ruthless tactics and desire for wealth, which align with the described motivations in the text.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors, like Bartholomew Dias, were primarily driven by a thirst for exploration and the desire to discover new lands and trade routes. They sought wealth and power, often at the expense of the indigenous populations they encountered.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes John Calvin's beliefs on election and predestination, suggesting that God's choice of who receives salvation is not based on human actions but rather His pleasure, which is a key contrast to the Lutheran belief in human free will and the ability to choose salvation. This indicates a significant difference in their understanding of human nature and God's role in salvation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The key distinction between Calvinists and Lutherans lies in their political goals, with Lutherans using their faith to challenge the authority of the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. This is in contrast to Calvinists, who did not emphasize political revolution but instead focused on the relationship between the state and the church.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote provided is from Galileo Galilei, a renowned Italian astronomer and physicist. He was influenced by the work of Nicolaus Copernicus, who proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system, which contradicted the geocentric model supported by the Catholic Church at the time. Johannes Kepler built upon Copernicus' work, developing Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Therefore, it is likely that Copernicus' ideas had a significant influence on Galileo's thoughts and writings.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's groundbreaking discoveries and observations regarding Jupiter's moons were likely the result of his own independent thinking and scientific brilliance. However, the quote mentions 'Medicean planets', which is a reference to the then-recent discovery of the five planet-like objects orbiting Jupiter. This was a significant contribution of Nicolaus Copernicus, who proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system. Therefore, it is most likely that Copernicus' ideas influenced Galileo's statement.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote mentions the discovery of four 'Medicean planets' orbiting Jupiter, indicating a shift in understanding of the solar system that challenged traditional Aristotelian views on astronomy and the heavens. This demonstrates the intellectual hallmark of secularism, which involves questioning and re-evaluating ancient philosophical ideas through experimentation and new knowledge.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The focus on artistic creativity and expression during the Renaissance stood in contrast to the scientific spirit of questioning established knowledge and conducting experiments. This shift from a purely academic pursuit of knowledge to a more hands-on approach is best described as a move away from Aristotelian natural philosophy, which emphasized theoretical inquiry.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions were adopted in response to the growing influence of liberal ideas in Germany, particularly among students and faculty. These ideas could be seen as a threat to the established order, including the union of German states. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that the governments feared the impact of liberal student activism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The German states' implementation of press restrictions and university regulations suggests a primary concern with the resurgence of Bonapartism and potential external threats. While students could spread liberal ideas, the focus on press freedom and the union's responsibility for attacks on other states' constitutions indicates a more immediate threat. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is support for Bonapartism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas criticizes the Spanish explorers' motives for their treatment of the indigenous people, describing them as 'ravaging' and 'murdering' them for their gold and riches. This indicates that de las Casas is criticizing the financial gain and personal glory motives, as the native population was being destroyed for material wealth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De las Casas is clearly outraged by the Spaniards' actions and their mistreatment of the natives, particularly their forceful attempts to convert them to Christianity. He criticizes their 'ultimate aim' of acquiring gold and wealth, indicating that this was the primary motive for their exploration and subsequent destruction of the indigenous population.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola's quote highlights the belief that humans are unique due to their potential for greatness and their ability to choose their path in life, implying an unlimited capacity for self-actualization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola emphasizes the special status of humans compared to other creatures, highlighting the divine gift of a soul that allows them to choose their own path. This unique capacity for self-determination and the pursuit of excellence sets humanity apart from nature's other creations.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as a result of their opposing class structures and interests, leading to a potential all-out war. This scenario is an 'inevitable result of fundamental economic change' due to the inherent contradictions within capitalist societies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels believed in historical patterns repeating themselves, with class struggles being a recurring theme throughout different epochs, leading to inevitable conflicts like the one between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This conflict is seen as an 'inevitable result of fundamental economic change'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Paris Exposition provided unique opportunities for anthropology studies, with various institutions and events offering resources to anthropologists and biologists. This suggests a concentration of scientific talent and interest in the field, indicating a shift or development in the scientific community.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the growing interest in understanding human origins and diversity, suggesting a shift towards universal education as a means to study and categorize different populations. This shift in focus is likely due to the increasing availability of educated individuals from diverse backgrounds, which was a product of widespread education.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the attitude towards native peoples under British rule, portraying them as 'sullen', 'half-devil and half-child', and a burden to be carried by the 'White Man'. This suggests that they are seen as inferior and a source of trouble, which aligns with colonial attitudes towards indigenous populations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem portrays the native peoples as 'half-devil and half-child,' suggesting they are in need of guidance and salvation through Christian teachings. This implies that the speaker believes these people are inferior and in need of 'civilization', which aligns with a colonial mindset.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Columbus' actions indicate that he was trying to gain the trust of the natives and establish peaceful relations, while de las Casas describes a very different, more violent reality. The native population's decline is attributed to the Spanish' 'eventual aim of acquiring gold', suggesting that their behavior was driven by greed. This is further supported by Columbus' mention of bartering for 'fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars', which could be seen as a form of exploitation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The two accounts differ because Columbus's initial interactions with the natives were peaceful and focused on trade, while later expeditions led by other Spaniards turned violent and exploitative. This suggests that the differences in behavior can be attributed to the changing attitudes and motivations of the Spanish conquerors over time.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's statement criticizes the persecution and destruction caused by the Inquisition, which was a Catholic institution. The answer choice that best fits this description is D, as it highlights the challenges to the Catholic Church's monopoly on truth, which would have been a significant influence for someone like Voltaire.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of persecution stems from the Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and legal equality, advocating for tolerance and respect for different beliefs and practices. This aligns with Locke's and Rousseau's ideas about natural rights and social contracts, which were gaining traction during this period.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a series of misfortunes and adventures endured by the characters, including being hanged, dissection, whipping, and being chained to a galley. These events are not typically associated with a high social status or a particular vocabulary. Instead, they suggest a common theme in Enlightenment literature: the idea that despite the suffering and injustice one may endure, there is a larger plan at work, often attributed to a pre-established harmony or divine order. This belief aligns with option C, as it encourages drawing universal conclusions from concrete experiences.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'concatenation of universal events' refers to the interconnectedness of European empires through maritime trade and exploration, bringing people from diverse backgrounds together on ships like the one mentioned in the passage. This illustrates the era's belief in using cause-and-effect to understand human behavior and the world, as seen in the quote.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, a prominent Enlightenment intellectual, expressed his disbelief and outrage at the devastating consequences of the Lisbon earthquake, which led him to question the existence of an all-loving and just God. This suggests that he held rationalist beliefs and valued human life and well-being, which is reflected in his desire for a more tolerant society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's critique of religious institutions and dogmatism reflects the Enlightenment's rejection of religion in favor of reason and scientific inquiry, leading many intellectuals to embrace atheism. However, this was not a universal stance, as some continued to hold religious beliefs alongside their rational thinking.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Galileo Galilei's observations and conclusions about celestial bodies, particularly the 'Medicean planets' (likely Jupiter's moons) orbiting Jupiter and their relationship to each other and Jupiter itself. This demonstrates the development of scientific thought as it involves experimentation and observation leading to new knowledge about the universe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observations provided evidence for the theories of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who proposed a geocentric model of the universe with celestial bodies revolving around the Earth. This contradicted the prevailing religious beliefs of the time, which held that the Earth was the center of the universe. Galileo's work demonstrated through experimentation and observation that the Earth in fact revolves around the Sun, challenging established religious and philosophical thought.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the introduction of scribbling machines (a type of printing press) has led to widespread unemployment among traditional laborers, particularly those involved in the woolen industry in Leeds. This has caused financial distress and a lack of opportunities for these workers to support their families and provide for their children. The text also mentions that the number of machines is significant, with over 170 located within a certain distance of Leeds, indicating a large-scale impact on employment. This suggests the replacement of traditional laborers by machines during the industrialization era.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The petition highlights the negative consequences of industrialization, particularly the displacement of workers by machines, leading to increased child labor as families struggled to survive. This directly points to the third option, the replacement of traditional laborers by machines during the Industrial Revolution in 18th-century Britain.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine's statement about the right to one's own opinion and belief is a direct critique of religious institutions and their role in society. This aligns with the influence of the Age of Enlightenment, where rationalism and individual rights were gaining traction, challenging traditional authority and religious monopolies on truth. The answer that best fits this context is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's rejection of established churches is rooted in the scientific advancements of the time, particularly Newton's laws, which promoted a deterministic view of the universe and challenged religious dogmas. This influenced his belief in individual rights and equity, as outlined in the works of Locke and Rousseau.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus' work aimed to make ancient wisdom accessible to a wider audience, specifically the educated classes. This was a significant departure from the exclusive nature of humanism prior to this time, where knowledge was hoarded by a select few. Huizinga highlights that Erasmus wanted to 'open the book of antiquity to all', indicating his desire for inclusivity and accessibility, which sets him apart from his predecessors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's significant contribution was his focus on religious texts and teachings, making them more accessible to the common people and challenging the Church's monopoly on spiritual knowledge. This made him stand out from other humanists who primarily aimed to showcase their learning and elegance.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the unification of Italy and the shift in power dynamics, with Sicily ceasing to be an independent kingdom and becoming a province of the newly unified Italian state. This is described as 'snapping' connections to its history and traditions, which aligns with the statement that 'the Italian nation has been at last united'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that the unification of Italy and the loss of Sicily's independence represent a significant break from the country's historical traditions and regional identities. This is particularly evident when the Italian army entered Rome, marking a shift in power dynamics and the end of Rome's 'ecumenical position'. Therefore, the statement indicating this shift is the most relevant.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the argument presented by Copernicus for the spherical shape of the cosmos, which is based on observation and induction. He observed the spherical shape of the Earth and then inferred that the entire universe, including celestial bodies, follows a similar structure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos is based on deductive reasoning from first principles, such as the idea of perfection and completeness associated with spheres. He observed the spherical form of celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and planets, and inferred that the Earth must also be spherical to maintain consistency in the universe.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text is an excerpt from John Calvin's 'Institutes of the Christian Religion', where he discusses the belief in predestination, or the idea that God has predetermined who will be saved and who will be damned. This belief is central to Calvinist theology and is a key tenet of his religious philosophy. Therefore, the passage strongly supports the belief in predestination.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's writings advocate for the importance of God's grace and predestination, suggesting that salvation can be obtained through acts of devotion and contributions to the Church, aligning with the concept of simony. However, the passage specifically mentions that salvation is not based on any actions or merits of man but solely on God's election and grace. This directly contradicts the idea of simony, which suggests that one can buy their way into heaven through donations or good deeds. Therefore, the passage best supports the belief in predestination and God's sovereignty over salvation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that there was a fear of a communist revolution if working-class aspirations weren't met after the war, which led to the Addison Act being implemented. However, by 1920, this fear had subsided, and the government reduced the housing program due to budget constraints and changing priorities. This indicates that the plans were changed because the government wanted to reduce spending on welfare programs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The change in housing plans reflects the government's concerns about potential communist uprisings among workers, who were demanding better living conditions after the war. This led to a reevaluation of welfare policies and a reduction in funding for housing projects.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was a result of the First Opium War (1839-1842), which was sparked by the British East India Company's demand for China to lift its ban on importing opium, as the British had become heavily dependent on it. This war led to significant changes in China's international relations and trade policies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing was a consequence of the Boxer Rebellion, where Chinese nationalists rebelled against foreign influence and trade, leading to concessions and the opening of more ports to British merchants. This treaty specifically allowed British merchants to trade in China without interference.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes William Morris' dissatisfaction with modern civilization, highlighting its wastefulness, inequality, and negative impact on art and simple pleasures. This suggests that Morris became a socialist to advocate for a more equitable and harmonious society, as he believed the current system was causing widespread misery and destruction. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Morris's aversion to modern society's wastefulness and misery led him to reject socialism, as he believed it would only exacerbate the existing problems and create further chaos. While he may have been influenced by Marx's ideas, his primary motivation was his own observations of the negative consequences of capitalism.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 1 advocates for the increased use of machines to manufacture wool, highlighting how they have already reduced manual labor and improved wages and trade. This aligns with the economic theory of industrialization, which emphasizes the use of technology and machinery to increase productivity and economic growth.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Source 1 supports the use of machines and expansion of the wool industry to increase exports and accumulate wealth in the form of gold and silver, aligning with the principles of bullionism. While source 2 is a poem that celebrates the actions of the Luddites, who were protesting the introduction of new machinery, it does not provide economic theory but rather expresses resistance to technological change.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the ideas of Fourier and others influenced the creation of national workshops in France, as evidenced by the quote referring to 'the French government' establishing such workshops in 1848. Therefore, the correct answer is B: France.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Fourier's ideas on education and societal reform align with the principles of the Chartist movement, which advocated for universal suffrage and social equality in Great Britain. The question specifically mentions that the experiment was conducted in 1848, which was a period of significant Chartist activity. Therefore, the correct answer is Great Britain.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, aiming to maintain peace and avoid conflict. It included a commitment not to attack each other and to consult on issues affecting their common interests. This suggests that the Soviets sought to strengthen their position through this pact, indicating they were concerned about potential threats and wanted to preserve their gains from the First World War.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviets, like the Germans, were interested in expanding their territory and influence in Eastern Europe, and saw the agreement as an opportunity to gain land from Czechoslovakia. This was a key motivator for the Soviets, as it directly aligned with their expansionist goals.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a nineteenth-century Russian historian's interpretation of a French writer's work, specifically the idea of 'fraternity' and the behavior of workers in France. The historian is likely to be interested in the social dynamics and ideologies present in the text, particularly the class struggle and the criticism of capitalism and materialism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Souvarine's frustration with the French workers stems from their lack of noblesse oblige, as they fail to use their newfound wealth to uplift the poor and create a more equitable society. This reflects a broader theme in 19th-century Europe of class struggle and the desire for social mobility, which a Russian historian would likely find intriguing.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a critical situation where Lenin urges people to take power and overthrow Kerensky, who is seen as a threat. This context aligns with the onset of the October Revolution, which was a civil war in Russia that overthrew the Provisional Government and established communist rule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's urgency and emphasis on immediate action suggest that the context for his call to power is the February Revolution, as the situation was rapidly evolving and required swift intervention. The reference to 'the masses' taking power and the demand to remove Kerensky indicates a revolutionary context, which is most closely associated with the February Revolution in Russia.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote provided is a response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which was a devastating natural disaster. Voltaire expressed his disbelief and frustration at the suffering caused by such an event, questioning the existence of a benevolent and just God. This sentiment reflects a shift away from Enlightenment rationalism, which emphasized reason and order, towards Romanticism, which valued emotion and nature. Thus, the answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's questioning of reason aligns with Adam Smith's economic theories, which suggest that individuals are driven by self-interest and rational decision-making, rather than emotional or moral considerations. This is reflected in his quote about the Lisbon earthquake, where he wonders if the event was a result of 'a wretched gamble' and suggests that it could teach people not to persecute each other. This indicates a shift towards a more emotional and intuitive approach to life, contrary to the rationalism of Enlightenment philosophy.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a character named Pangloss who endures various misfortunes, including hanging, dissection, whipping, and being chained to a galley, all while maintaining his philosophical belief in the 'pre-established harmony'. This suggests that he has a strong sense of resilience and optimism, despite the harsh circumstances. His ability to maintain this mindset indicates a high level of emotional fortitude and a positive outlook on life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The description of the Inquisition executioner's incompetence reflects Voltaire's personal experiences with the brutality and inefficiency of the Inquisition, particularly under the leadership of Torquemada. This experience led to his rejection of Catholic dogma and a mockery of religious discipline.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, the author of 'Candide', is known for his critical and satirical views on philosophy and religion. He often used the character of Candide to critique various philosophical concepts and religious doctrines. The quote mentions that Pangloss, a philosopher, was hung, dissected, whipped, and tugging at an oar, which could indicate a life filled with suffering and injustice. Despite this, Pangloss maintains his belief in the 'pre-established harmony', indicating that he is a rationalist who believes that the universe operates according to a set of logical principles. This aligns with the philosophical views of Leibniz, who is often associated with rationalism and the idea of a pre-established harmony.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's satirical portrayal of society's flaws aligns with Adam Smith's economic principles, which advocate for individual liberty and limited government intervention in the market. While Rousseau and Hume also offered critical insights, their philosophies differ from Voltaire's in that they often emphasized social contract theory and empiricism, respectively.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that Erasmus wanted to make the 'book of antiquity' accessible to all, which suggests that he supported open access to knowledge and education, a value that is prevalent in twentieth-century Europe. This indicates that the author's life and values influenced Huizinga's support for Erasmus.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Huizinga's support for Erasmus' belief in open access to knowledge is typical of the camaraderie and mutual respect often found among philosophers, who tend to uphold and promote each other's ideas. This is a common trait in academic circles and is not limited to any specific era or region.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the serfs will receive 'full rights of free rural inhabitants', which includes land ownership and freedom from obligations to nobles, which is a significant change from their previous status as serfs. This was a major shift in social hierarchy and power dynamics, indicating a need for a strong impetus to convince the Tsar to make such a drastic decision.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tsar Alexander II's decision to emancipate the serfs was driven by the need for a larger and more mobile labor force to support the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad and to bolster the ranks of the military. This is indicated by the mention of 'a labor force' in point D, which was likely a key factor in the tsar's decision.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes two methods of discovering truth, one starting from general principles and descending to specifics, and the other starting from specific observations and ascending to general principles. By the 1800s, this method of empirical reasoning had likely become a core principle of scientific inquiry, with many refinements over time. This change is reflected in the passage's emphasis on bringing people 'to particulars' and forming an acquaintance with things.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Empirical reasoning, as advocated by Bacon, has evolved considerably over time, incorporating new discoveries and methodologies, to the point where it would be unrecognizable to its early proponents. This evolution is reflected in the changing social and cultural landscape, with the method becoming a core principle of scientific inquiry and a foundation for modern science.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Boxer Rebellion was a revolt against foreign powers and their influence in China, which occurred after the Treaty of Nanjing. The Boxers saw the treaty as a symbol of Western domination and sought to remove all foreigners from China. They believed that the treaty had given too much power to foreign merchants and their businesses. The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The Boxers, recognizing the benefits of trade and Western influence, aligned themselves with foreign powers to defend the Treaty of Nanjing against Chinese rebellions. This led to their eventual defeat at the hands of the Chinese government.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto is a political pamphlet written by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in 1848, which advocates for a classless society and common ownership of the means of production. It reflects their belief in materialist historical唯物論 (materialism and economic determinism). This mode of thinking emphasizes that economic factors are the primary driving force behind societal change.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  The Communist Manifesto reflects the influence of Hegelian idealism, which emphasizes the role of ideas and consciousness in shaping history and society. This philosophical school of thought influenced Marx and Engels' belief in the transformative power of class struggle and their vision for a communist society.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the economic prowess of Renaissance Florence, highlighting its dominance in the trade of wool and silk, with a focus on export. This suggests that the economy was primarily based on the manufacturing and selling of these goods to other regions.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The passage highlights the abundance of agricultural products in Florence, suggesting that the export of these goods formed the primary basis of the city's economy during the Renaissance. This is supported by the mention of 'bread, meat, wine, oil, vegetables, cheese, hay, and wood' as products supplied to the city from local estates. Additionally, the presence of large numbers of shops and warehouses dedicated to wool and silk trading further emphasizes the importance of these two commodities in Florence's economy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Louis XIV's meticulous attention to courtly manners and the presence of courtiers, which suggests a strong focus on social hierarchy and status. This is supported by his reputation for being quick to notice and punish those who did not conform to his expectations. This behavior indicates a desire to maintain control and power through social manipulation and the use of favoritism as a tool for gain.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cardinal Mazarin, with his astute political and diplomatic skills, played a crucial role in reorganizing France and establishing it as a dominant power in Europe during Louis XIV's reign. He was instrumental in shaping the country's foreign policy and navigating complex alliances, which contributed significantly to its rise as a world power.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that a woman's ability to manage a household effectively influences the overall happiness and well-being of the family, implying that her skills in this domain are superior to those of men. This implies that women are better suited for household management.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Beeton's focus on household management skills suggests that she believed women's natural talents and abilities were better suited to the role of educators and administrators in schools. This is because these roles require a strong understanding of domestic duties, which, according to Beeton, are inherently feminine.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the fear of a revolution similar to Russia's, indicating increased disillusionment and cynicism among the working class due to unmet aspirations. This attitude is evident in the context of post-World War I Britain.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The shift in attitude towards social welfare programs reflects the growing fear of communism and its potential influence on British society after the First World War. This fear led to a reevaluation of policies aimed at improving living conditions for the working class, as seen with the Government's housing program cuts.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a call to arms and mobilization of all citizens of the French Republic for the purpose of waging war and resisting foreign invasion, which aligns with the provided choices. The text also mentions the establishment of an 'extraordinary manufacture of arms', indicating a reform of the economy to support military efforts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Committee of Public Safety's extreme measures and authoritarian control, while initially effective in mobilizing resources, ultimately contributed to its own demise and the instability of the French Republic. This is evident in the passage's reference to the Committee's 'unlimited powers' and its centralization of control over all aspects of society, including the economy, human resources, and even religious rituals. The extreme measures taken by the Committee, while successful in the short term, ultimately led to a lack of checks and balances, which caused instability and eventually contributed to the Committee's downfall.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes King Louis XIV's meticulous attention to detail and his strict expectations of those around him, particularly those who were not of high social standing. He demanded explanations for absence and had a keen eye for those who did not conform to his ideals. This suggests a weakness in that he was overly concerned with appearances and social hierarchy, which could be seen as a regret as it may have hindered effective governance and the development of genuine relationships with his people.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Louis XIV's reliance on intendants, professional bureaucrats who administered his kingdom, proved to be a significant weakness, as they often acted independently and undermined the authority of the nobility. This led to a lack of unity among the nobility, which could have been an asset in governing effectively. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the long-term effects of Tsar Alexander II's emancipation proclamation, which granted serfs land and freedom while retaining some obligations. This suggests that the former serfs were not immediately freed from poverty as they still had obligations to nobles and were restricted to communal farming. However, the proclamation laid the foundation for future reforms, such as the organization of Peace Offices and cantonal courts, which could have improved the peasants' legal status and access to justice over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The emancipation of serfs in Russia resulted in a surge in agricultural production and exports, allowing the country to accumulate wealth and invest in industrial development. This led to a more diverse economy and improved living standards for many Russians.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and renowned writer, emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust in order to prevent similar atrocities from occurring again and to honor those who suffered and died during that dark period. He suggests that by remembering, communities can heal and find redemption. This quote specifically mentions that remembering is crucial for ""the world [being] worthy of salvation"", implying that it serves as a reminder of the need for moral conduct and a warning against repeating past mistakes.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Wiesel emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust as a way to ensure that such atrocities never happen again, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of hatred and intolerance. This suggests that remembering is a tool for prevention rather than reconciliation or forgiveness.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Herbert Spencer, in his work 'Social Statistics: Survival of the Fittest Applied to Humankind', argues that the state's intervention in providing aid to the poor is contrary to its role of protecting citizens and their freedom. He believes that poverty and distress are natural consequences of individual actions and are beneficial when viewed from a broader perspective. This aligns with the philosophy of laissez-faire, which opposes government intervention in economic matters. Thus, Spencer likely opposed the use of tax money for such purposes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer seems to believe in the power of the working class to unite and demand better conditions, as he criticizes the government for interfering with the natural order of things. This suggests that he opposed the use of tax money to provide aid to the poor, as it would be an unnecessary intervention in the free market.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's 'conservatism' aimed to maintain the status quo, suppress change, and preserve traditional values, institutions, and authority. He wanted to prevent any new ideas or reforms that might disrupt the existing order, particularly those related to democracy and religion. This aligns with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich clearly advocates for a complete halt to any new ideas or changes in society, as he sees them as threats to the established order and traditional values. This strongly suggests that he is against any form of progressive ideology, including nationalism and liberalism, which often bring about social and political reforms. The answer choice that best describes Metternich's goals is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the conditions set out in the Tsar's Manifesto of 1861, which emancipated serfs in Russia. It mentions that serfs will receive land and certain rights but also have obligations to nobles, suggesting a system where they are no longer fully free but still retain some land ownership and financial potential. This is distinct from pure slavery or complete emancipation without restrictions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the emancipation of serfs will lead to a diverse class of farmers, with many achieving significant wealth and success due to their newfound freedom and land ownership opportunities. This is indicated in the text as a potential outcome of the manifesto.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the opportunities for anthropology research in Paris during the 1889 Exposition, a time when France was under the Third Republic, which began in 1870 after the end of the Second Empire and the Franco-Prussian War. The stability and relative peace of the Third Republic likely contributed to the open environment for anthropological study.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Exposition likely coincided with France's preparations for the Franco-Prussian War, as the nation sought to showcase its advancements in science and technology to bolster national pride and military prowess. This exhibition of scientific progress would have been a direct contrast to the political instability of the Second Empire, which was marked by frequent coups and revolutions. Thus, it is most reasonable to conclude that the opportunities described were due to the stability brought about by the Third Republic.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union to maintain peace and avoid aggression towards each other. This agreement was signed in 1939 but is based on a non-aggression pact established in 1926. Therefore, it can be inferred that they had some degree of a non-aggression agreement since at least 1926.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text implies that the 1939 pact marked the beginning of a peaceful relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, as it established a framework for nonaggression and cooperation after a period of potential hostility. This suggests that they had not previously been in a state of war or had an active peace agreement since 1926.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided excerpts from the Navigation Acts of 1651 indicate restrictions on goods imported into England and its possessions, favoring British ships and goods. This protectionist policy contradicts free trade principles advocated by Adam Smith, who believed in the benefits of open markets and unrestricted trade.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts seem to align with Malthus's ideas about limiting population growth and preserving resources, as they restrict trade and potentially reduce the influx of goods and people into England. This could be seen as a way to maintain stability and prevent overconsumption.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a scene from the perspective of someone who experienced the outbreak of World War I, specifically mentioning the announcement of mobilization and the reaction of the people of Paris. The passage does not mention any skepticism or enthusiasm about the war across Europe as a whole, only in Paris. So, the correct answer is that mobilization was greeted with great enthusiasm all across Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the mobilization for war was met with widespread enthusiasm throughout Europe, as nations rallied behind their respective causes and embraced the prospect of conflict. While it mentions Paris specifically, it does so in the context of the entire continent, implying a pan-European sentiment.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the 'Specter of Communism' is being fought by a united front of European powers, indicating that it is seen as a real and powerful force. This leads to the conclusion that by 1917, the idea of the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat had become a reality in Russia, as this was a key tenet of Communist ideology.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pamphlet seems to predict the establishment of a strong Russian Parliament, which would represent the interests of the people and challenge the authority of the ruling class. This idea became a reality with the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1917, a socialist state with a powerful central government and a focus on public education.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase 'blank check' implies that no conditions or limitations were attached to the telegram, indicating that Germany would support Austria-Hungary unconditionally. This is suggested by Bethmann-Hollweg's statement that he will 'stand by Austria-Hungary faithfully', implying a lack of specific conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram indicates Germany's unwavering support for Franz Joseph as he assumed the throne after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, aiming to maintain stability within the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This support is often referred to as a 'blank check', implying an unlimited commitment without specific conditions or limitations.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Louis XIV, a king with an inflated sense of self-importance, meticulously monitored who attended his court, using it as a tool to exert control and influence. He favored those who spent lavishly and expected loyalty, effectively forcing his courtiers to depend on him financially. This behavior indicates a bias towards those who aligned themselves with his taste for splendor and magnificence, and a disfavour for those who did not conform.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Duke seems to advocate for a stronger central state with greater control over the French population, as he criticizes the nobility for their resistance to Louis XIV's authority and policies. This suggests that he is biased towards a more centralized and potentially authoritarian form of governance.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text is an excerpt from 'The Communist Manifesto' by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, published in 1848. They argue that the recognition of Communism as a force by European powers indicates the need for Communists to openly declare their intentions to counter the 'nursery tale' of fear spread about Communism. This suggests that they are concerned with provoking action and addressing the fears of others regarding Communism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Marx and Engels seem to be highlighting their grasp of the concerns and perspectives of those who oppose communism, showing that they are aware of the movement's growing power and influence. This is evident in their call for communists to openly state their views and aims, which was a response to the fear and misinformation surrounding communism at the time.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Hernan Cortez's letter to Emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) in 1521, where he justifies the conquest of Mexico and the treatment of its indigenous people. The passage mentions that Cortez burned the culprit who ate human flesh, prohibited such practices, and taught the people about monotheism and submission to the emperor's rule. This indicates a shift towards Christianity and away from indigenous beliefs and practices, which was a key goal of European colonial powers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the African slave trade intensified as Europeans established colonies throughout Africa, requiring a large labor force to exploit the continent's resources and develop colonial settlements. This is evident in the expansion of European colonies across Africa and the establishment of plantations in the Americas, which required a vast workforce.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pico della Mirandola's 'Oration on the Dignity of Man' celebrates human potential and individuality, suggesting that humans can become anything they choose. This contradicts the notion of being unworthy, so C is out. While D is a valid interpretation, it doesn't directly contradict Pico's message. B is also not correct as it's an interpretation rather than an inherent belief rejected by Pico. A is thus incorrect as well. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pico seems to argue against the notion that humans have a predetermined purpose or should strive for specific goals, instead emphasizing the freedom and potential for individuals to choose their own paths in life. This suggests a rejection of the idea that there is a singular, fixed definition of 'man'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's quote highlights the urgency of 'Perestroika', indicating that the issues it addresses are inherent within the Soviet Union's socialist system, suggesting that a socialist society is more prone to these internal crises than a capitalist one.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev appears to believe that the need for perestroika stemmed from the actions of capitalist enemies who sought to undermine the Soviet Union and its socialist system. This suggests that he saw the issues as external, not inherent in the system itself.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Erasmus' work in making classical culture and knowledge more accessible to the general public, which aligns with the core principles of the Renaissance humanism movement. This movement aimed to revive interest in classical learning and human potential, which is distinct from other religious or philosophical movements mentioned.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus's approach to humanism aligns with the Pietist movement, as he emphasizes the importance of individual faith, religious devotion, and the study of scripture for personal growth and understanding. This is in contrast to other humanists who focused more on classical texts and philosophy. Thus, the correct answer is C: Pietism.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the English Parliament's Act of Supremacy in 1534, which established King Henry VIII as the head of the Church of England and granted him authority to suppress heresy and promote virtue in Christianity. This act consolidated the power of the monarchy over the church, marking a significant shift away from Catholic influence in England.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that the Act of Supremacy was enacted in response to a surge in religious devotion among the masses, as people sought a stronger connection to the Church and a more defined role for the monarchy in religious affairs. This indicates a trend towards increasing religiosity among the common people.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the views of Thomas Henry Huxley, a prominent scientist and figure in the evolution debate. He argued that life has a physical basis, supporting materialist ideologies which dominated 19th-century thought. Materialism asserts that only matter exists, and consciousness and life are products of physical processes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley's views seem to align with conservative ideologies, as he emphasizes the importance of understanding the fundamental building blocks of life and society, promoting a cautious and evidence-based approach to change and progress. This aligns with conservative principles that often advocate for stability, order, and traditional values.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy of 1534 was passed by the English Parliament during the reign of King Henry VIII. It affirmed the king's supreme authority over the Church of England, separate from the Catholic Church. This act was likely an attempt to solidify Henry's control and establish a distinct English church, which could be seen as a move away from Catholicism and towards Protestantism, hence option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy was likely driven by Henry VIII's desire to secure the legitimacy of his heir and ensure a smooth succession to the throne, as he sought to prevent challenges to his authority and maintain stability within the realm. While it also aimed to suppress heresy and promote virtue in Christianity, the primary motivation was to strengthen Henry's power and ensure the continuity of the Tudor dynasty.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the unification of Italy and how Rome lost its 'ecumenical' status as the author expresses sadness about the end of a great phase in European history. This suggests that the author is against the rapid and complete unification, which was led by Napoleon III, as it overwhelmed the historical significance of Rome.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's concerns about the rapid and complete unification of Italy likely stem from Napoleon III's approach, as he sought to extend French influence and control over the Italian peninsula, potentially undermining regional identities and autonomy. This was in contrast to other leaders like Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel, who advocated for a more organic and collaborative process that respected local cultures and traditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions aimed to maintain the status quo and preserve the power of the monarchies and established order, which is in contrast to promoting democracy or nationalist revolutions. It sought to suppress any voices that opposed this, ensuring control over information and citizens' lives.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions reflect Metternich's commitment to democratic principles and Enlightenment ideals, as he sought to empower the people and establish representative governments across European states. This directly contradicts the aim to 'establish control of European states by democracy'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Edict of Nantes was issued by Henry IV of France in 1598, which granted religious freedom to both Catholic and Protestant faiths in France. This edict ended the previous period of religious conflict in the country. Therefore, the correct answer is that prior to 1598, France had been free of religious conflict.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The edict explicitly states the goal of restoring and re-establishing the Catholic religion, which suggests that Henry IV himself must have been a devout Catholic. Additionally, the edict aims to end religious conflicts, indicating that there had been troubles and differences due to varying religious beliefs prior to 1598.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Paris Exposition of 1889, a time when anthropology and other scientific fields flourished due to the abundance of opportunities for research and collaboration. This was a period of great interest in the study of human diversity and its connection to the natural world, which is reflected in the various institutions and events mentioned. The passage specifically mentions the French capital's 'rare advantages' for anthropologists and biologists, indicating that this field of study was at its peak during this time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions studying the natural history of man and the diversity of cultures, which likely became possible due to a large influx of immigrants from various parts of the world. This influx of diverse individuals with their unique cultural practices and biological characteristics would have been a significant event that sparked interest in anthropology and encouraged scientific exploration.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 'epoch of the bourgeoisie', which refers to the modern era, and states that it has simplified class antagonisms, leading to a division into two hostile camps: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. This aligns with the French Revolution, a significant event in European history where the old feudal order was overthrown and a new social order based on capitalism and class struggle emerged.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Seven Years' War was a significant conflict with major implications for European power dynamics and social structures, making it relevant to Marx and Engels' theories of class struggle. While the other options are historical events, they do not align with the reference to 'simplified class antagonisms' as they did not have a direct impact on the development of modern bourgeois society and its inherent class struggles.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Nanjing in 1839 granted British merchants the right to trade and reside in specific Chinese cities, indicating a direct concession that established a presence and influence in those areas without full colonial control.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty grants British subjects the right to reside and conduct business in specific Chinese cities, which directly leads to the establishment of British businesses in those areas. This is a clear indication of economic concessions made by China to Britain.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The quote describes Galileo Galilei's observations of four celestial bodies orbiting Jupiter, challenging the then-prevailing geocentric model of the universe centered on Earth. This was a groundbreaking discovery that supported the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus and revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Galileo's observation of four stars revolving around Jupiter is revolutionary because it provides evidence of celestial bodies moving around planets other than Earth. This contradicts the previously held belief that the Earth was the center of the universe and supported the heliocentric model proposed by Nicolaus Copernicus. Thus, this conclusion challenges the traditional understanding of the cosmos.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a character who experiences various misfortunes but maintains his belief that 'everything happens for the best', reflecting the Enlightenment belief in the power of reason and the perfectibility of society through scientific inquiry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Candide's persistent belief that everything happens for the best aligns with the Enlightenment idea that humans are naturally good and capable of self-governance without the need for strong central authority. This belief in human perfection and self-improvement is a key tenet of the Enlightenment, which promotes the use of reason and science to improve society.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes Napoleon's vast knowledge and interest in a range of topics, indicating a high level of intellectual curiosity and talent. This suggests that the historian was impressed with Napoleon's intellect and his ability to grasp multiple subjects, which aligns with the statement about his 'genius of the most exalted kind'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Abbott highlights Napoleon's vast knowledge and ability to command, which likely extended to his effective control over social movements and potential challenges to his authority, including women's rights. While the excerpt mentions nothing specific about women's rights, it emphasizes Napoleon's genius and broad understanding of various subjects, suggesting that he would not tolerate any opposition.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 1 mentions the introduction of machinery in the woolen industry, which reduced manual labor and increased wages and trade. This suggests that industrialization brought about positive changes in the workforce and their livelihoods. On the other hand, Source 2 is a song praising the Luddites, who were protesting against the negative impacts of industrialization, particularly the replacement of human workers with machines. Thus, the answer is D as it best represents the changes brought on by industrialization that motivated the actions of the Luddites.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The lyrics express anger towards those in power who support the use of machines, suggesting that the Luddites were primarily motivated by government policies that favored industrialization at the expense of workers. This led to a sense of resentment and rebellion among the agricultural workers, who felt their traditional skills were being made obsolete.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire, a prominent figure of the Enlightenment, advocated for religious tolerance and skepticism towards organized religion. He believed that the destruction caused by the earthquake should serve as a reminder that humans should not persecute each other due to their religious differences, supporting option D.",D,Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's sarcastic remark about the inquisitors being crushed suggests that he believed religious tolerance could lead to social disharmony and ultimately undermine the established order. This aligns with the belief that 'religious toleration should be given to all people of all religions'.,D
B,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, a prominent philosopher, argued that the power of any government is derived from the consent of the governed. This consent forms a social contract, establishing the legitimacy of the state and its authority over the people. The text mentions that when the legislative transcends this fundamental rule and abuses its power, it breaches the trust given by the people, indicating that their power is derived from the people's consent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke emphasizes the importance of mutual consent in forming a legitimate government, which implies the existence of a social contract or covenant that outlines the rights and responsibilities of both the government and the people. This covenant is the foundation for the power held by the government over the society it governs.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that Clemenceau believed the lyrics of 'Deutschland über alles' reflected a certain mindset in Germany, implying an aggressive attitude and a sense of nationalism that may have contributed to the outbreak of war. This belief is expressed as a critique, suggesting that this mindset played a role in the events leading up to the catastrophe of 1914.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to Germany's 'ultimate framework' suggests that he recognized their advanced military tactics and ability to shape the course of modern warfare. This implies that he saw Germany as a formidable opponent, which is reflected in their national anthem, 'Deutschland über alles', that emphasizes national pride and strength.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's quote directly states that the 'society is ripe for change' and that delay could lead to 'serious social, economic, and political crises'. This indicates that a restructuring was necessary to avoid these potential issues, which aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's statement about the risk of 'exacerbated internal situation' implies that the proposed restructuring of Soviet society could actually worsen existing problems and lead to further instability. This suggests that option B is incorrect, while the other options are either statements of necessity or potential outcomes, which are not explicitly mentioned in the passage.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a Renaissance ideal of a courtly man, emphasizing physical prowess, martial skills, grace, knowledge of the humanities, music, and avoiding deceit. This aligns with the Renaissance humanism movement, which valued individual excellence and the pursuit of knowledge and art.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of developing various skills and knowledge, including classical languages and literature, which aligns with the secular values of the Renaissance era that prioritized reason and human potential over religious dogma. Individualism is also hinted at through the focus on physical prowess and the desire to attain social grace and excellence in multiple domains.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a set of laws, known as the Navigation Acts, that were passed by the Rump Parliament of England in 1651. These acts aimed to regulate trade between England and her colonies, as well as other countries. By restricting the import of goods from certain regions and limiting the ships allowed to carry them, the acts sought to protect English industries and colonies from foreign competition. The desired outcome was to strengthen England's economic dominance and protect her interests in the New World.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The acts restrict trade between England, its colonies, and other European nations, which suggests a primary goal of weakening French influence in the Atlantic and securing English dominance in maritime trade. This was a strategic move to counter French economic and colonial power at the time.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a traditional view of women's roles, emphasizing their importance in the domestic sphere and suggesting that their performance sets the tone for the entire household. This implies that women were expected to have a strong influence and be responsible within their homes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's comparison of a housewife to a military commander suggests that women's efficient management of the household translates to significant power and influence in the public sphere. This interpretation aligns with option C, acknowledging women's leadership roles within their homes, which extends beyond the domestic realm.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Carlsbad Resolutions, adopted in 1819, aimed to curb the power of liberal publications and their impact on state sovereignty. Pope Pius IX was a conservative figurehead known for his opposition to liberal reforms during this time period. He would have been the least likely to oppose these decrees as he favored maintaining the status quo and traditional religious authority.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich, known for his conservative policies and opposition to revolutionary movements, would likely have found common ground with other figures who advocated for strong central authority and limited press freedom, such as Klemens von Metternich. Mazzini, on the other hand, was a prominent Italian nationalist and liberal, advocating for a unified Italy and strong civil liberties, which directly contrasts with the restrictions imposed by the Carlsbad Resolutions.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a severe famine in France during the 17th century, with people eating mice, roots, and even animals' carcasses due to extreme hunger. This indicates a lack of food availability, which is typically caused by low agricultural productivity or adverse weather conditions. While taxes and transportation could also be factors, they are not mentioned as primary causes in the text, making them less likely contributors. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is 'Low-productivity agricultural practices'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The report describes widespread hunger and desperation, which were likely exacerbated by high taxes imposed on the peasantry, leaving them with insufficient resources to purchase food even when available. While transportation issues could have contributed, they are unlikely to be the primary cause of such widespread famine, especially given the context of the time. Adverse weather can certainly play a role in reducing agricultural productivity and exacerbating hunger, but it is less likely to lead to the extreme scenarios described without other factors. Therefore, low taxes on the peasantry and middle class are the least likely contributors to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the 17th century.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Clemenceau blamed Germany for not being able to maintain its 'Deutschland über alles' policy, which ultimately led to their downfall. This directly points towards World War I as the blame was placed on Germany's inability to uphold their national motto, which was likely a reference to their aggressive foreign policy before the war.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's reference to the 'catastrophe of 1914' and Germany's responsibility points to his belief that their actions and policies contributed to the devastating economic consequences of the Great Depression. This was a global economic downturn that began in 1929, so it is unlikely that he would blame them for World War I or the Franco-Prussian War, which were events from earlier decades. As such, the most appropriate answer is the Great Depression.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a confidential telegram from the German Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, to the German ambassador in Vienna. It discusses the Austro-Hungarian-Russian conflict and the potential threat to the Triple Alliance. The context is the Balkan Question and the alliance dynamics between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The telegram mentions Austria-Hungary's anxieties regarding Pan-Slavic agitation and Germany's commitment to its ally, which aligns with the context of German unification and the efforts to consolidate power within a unified German state. This suggests that the description best captures the context of the telegram, as it addresses the underlying tensions and alliances that influenced the situation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's fears stem from the spread of revolutionary ideas, particularly those of personal liberty and nationalism, which led to radical changes in Europe. These ideas, if not controlled, could result in a loss of monarchical power and lead to civil unrest.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metternich's call for strong and just monarchs suggests a concern that unchecked monarchical power could lead to oppression and instability, requiring a balance of power within each nation to protect the rights of citizens. This fear is particularly relevant in the context of the time, where the rise of nationalism and the Enlightenment had fostered ideas of personal liberty and individual rights, which could challenge the traditional authority of monarchs.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a desperate situation of famine and hunger in Normandy, France, in 1651. People are starving to death, and some turn to eating mice, roots, and even the bodies of dead animals for survival. This suggests that agricultural practices and food distribution were inadequate, leading to widespread starvation. The Enlightenment movement, which began in the late 17th century, focused on rationalism, science, and improving human conditions through education and progress. It would have been too early for its influence to be seen during the time of this report.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment era emphasized reason and progress, leading to advancements in various fields, including agriculture and crop yields. This movement occurred during the 17th century, a time when Europe was facing famine and poverty due to poor agricultural practices and natural disasters. The Enlightenment provided a new way of thinking that encouraged innovation and progress, which could have potentially helped improve crop yields and alleviate the suffering described in the report.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Vladimir Lenin emphasizes the urgency of seizing power and mobilizing the masses to overthrow Kerensky and his government. This suggests that Lenin believed that only through a swift and decisive action, led by the people and the army, could Russia be saved from collapse and chaos. Thus, the correct answer is C: the Bolshevik faction could wait no longer to seize power.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's call to action emphasizes the role of the armed people and the army, suggesting that only a strong military force can effectively govern Russia during this critical time. This indicates a belief in the necessity for the military to take power and make decisions quickly, without delay.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Edict of Nantes was issued by Henry IV of France in 1598, which granted religious freedom to Protestants and allowed them to live peacefully in his kingdom without interference. This indicates that Henry IV intended for Protestants to be able to practice their faith freely, which supports choice B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The document mentions the restoration of Catholicism, which implies that Henry IV himself was converting to Catholicism to bring peace and unity to France. This is in contrast to option D, as it is unlikely that a conversion to Protestantism would have brought about such harmony.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the ideal characteristics of a 'Courtier', a man of noble birth who was expected to be well-rounded and skilled in various areas, including martial arts, music, literature, and languages. This suggests that Castiglione values education and self-improvement, which is reflected in his desire for coeducational public high schools paid for by the state (A).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Castiglione's ideal Courtier is educated in various disciplines, suggesting a belief in the importance of accessible education for all, regardless of gender or social status. This includes knowledge of weapons and martial arts, which could be taught at co-ed public schools. The text also emphasizes the importance of music, which could be taught in a co-ed setting as well. Therefore, Castiglione would likely support co-ed public high schools paid for by the state.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a political reaction to the Chartists and their actions, which included 'denouncing' and 'threatening' others, and proposing the seizure of property. This suggests a conservative response aimed at suppressing these disruptive elements and protecting property rights, thus indicating a reaction of 'Conservatism'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists advocated for radical political and social reforms, which aligns with the concept of radicalism as a response to the existing power structures. Radicals often challenge established norms and seek systemic change, which is evident in the actions of the Chartists.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a letter from Queen Victoria, indicating that she was concerned about attending multiple social events in a short period, which could lead to fatigue. This suggests a high level of social engagement and entertainment, which was common during the eighteenth century in France, known for its lavish parties and balls.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Queen's enjoyment of social events and entertainment is reminiscent of the opulent lifestyle and extravagant court culture of sixteenth-century Spain. This era was known for its lavish parties, balls, and concerts, often featuring foreign performers and elaborate costumes. The text hints at a similar atmosphere, with references to 'a party', 'an Ancient Concert', and the desire to avoid fatigue, all pointing towards the excesses of Spanish court life.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the abolition of 'lettres de cachet', which were used to detain people without trial, and the introduction of the jury system for criminal cases. This suggests a move towards a more just legal system, addressing the issue of unfair legal practices and protecting personal rights, which is not mentioned as a problem in the other options.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and liberties challenged the existing social and political order in France, contributing to the tensions that led to the revolution. While the document mentions the abolition of 'lettres de cachet' and the introduction of the jury system, it does not directly address financial problems or the specific issue of social and political inequality. Thus, the most appropriate answer is option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The subject of the quotation is the significance and impact of the revolutions of 1848 in German history, specifically how it influenced future political and social developments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the failure of the 1848 revolutions and its impact on German history, suggesting that the main focus is on the unsuccessful nature of these uprisings. This failed revolution had a significant impact on shaping Germany's future trajectory, particularly in terms of political and social ideals.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon Bonaparte, a renowned military leader and emperor, is known for his conquests and the establishment of the Napoleonic Code. However, he faced criticism for placing his relatives on foreign thrones, which was seen as nepotism and a potential threat to the stability of his empire. This action could have created power struggles and divided his empire, potentially weakening his position.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's practice of placing his family members on foreign thrones was a controversial aspect of his rule, as it raised concerns about nepotism and the expansion of French influence. This choice is the most likely target of criticism from the public or political opponents.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Paine, a prominent Enlightenment figure, is known for his pamphlet 'The Age of Reason', where he expresses his skepticism towards organized religion and supports the idea of individual freedom of thought. He advocates for a secular government based on human rights and morality, which aligns with the concept of checks and balances to prevent power abuse. Thus, the correct answer is B: Baron Montesquieu.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rousseau's emphasis on the social contract and the general will aligns with the concept of checks and balances, as it aims to prevent abuses of power by the government. The 'general will' represents the collective interests of the people, acting through democratic institutions, which can be seen as a system of checks and balances in itself.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a conflict between social classes, particularly between the working class and the bourgeoisie, as depicted in Émile Zola's novel 'Germinal'. This conflict revolves around the idea of class struggle and the desire for material wealth, which aligns with the themes explored in 'The Communist Manifesto', a book that advocates for classless society and common ownership of the means of production.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Souvarine's criticism of the French workers' aspirations for wealth and leisure aligns with Bellamy's vision of a utopian society where individuals contribute to the common good and share resources equally. This conflict reflects the tension between individualism and collective welfare, which is central to 'Looking Backward'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the unification of Italy and the shift in power from Rome as a distinct entity to being the capital of a larger kingdom. This indicates a loss of its 'imperial traditions', which are likely religious, given that the author mentions the 'ecumenical position' and 'ecumenical traditions' of Rome being swept away. These traditions are likely religious in nature, making answer B the correct choice.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author's lament about the loss of Sicily's distinct identity and its absorption into the Italian kingdom suggests a concern for the preservation of the Roman language and its cultural significance. This is evident in the text, where the author expresses sadness about Rome's 'Imperial traditions' being cast aside, implying a reference to linguistic and cultural heritage.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a scene from 1914, where a passerby announces the news of war to a French newspaper office, and Clemenceau, their chief, is relieved to hear Paris' enthusiastic reaction. This suggests that Clemenceau believes that France will be able to win the war, as he sees the public's joy as a sign of their support for the military effort.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Clemenceau's relief upon hearing about Paris's reaction suggests that he had doubts about France's ability to win the war and was worried about public morale. While the passage does not explicitly state this, it implies that a positive public response would alleviate such concerns.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Francis Bacon, an English philosopher, introduced his Novum Organum in 1620, which marked a significant shift from the Renaissance era's study methods. The Renaissance era is known for its focus on classical authority and sponsorship from the Church, whereas Bacon's approach emphasized a systematic method of inquiry, moving from particular observations to general principles. This distinction lies in their differing approaches to knowledge acquisition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Renaissance was heavily supported by the Church, while the scientific era saw a shift towards patronage from wealthy merchants and private individuals, leading to a change in the focus and methods of intellectual inquiry. This shift away from religious authority and towards empirical investigation marks a significant difference between the two periods.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Napoleon's diary entries indicate that he understood the importance of public perception and reputation for maintaining his power. He also recognized the role of military victories in achieving and sustaining his power. The Continental System was a set of economic policies implemented to isolate Britain from continental Europe, which was an attempt to defeat England through economic means. This strategy aimed to cripple Britain's trade and economy, ultimately weakening their position as a global power rival to France.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Continental System aimed to create a unified Europe under French leadership by isolating England economically and politically. This was done to punish Britain for its support of other nations, particularly during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. By controlling the continent, Napoleon sought to establish his dominance and power.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Hernan Cortez's letter to Emperor Charles V, where he explains his actions in converting and 'civilizing' the indigenous people of Mexico. He mentions that he came to teach them about Christianity and the rule of Emperor Charles V, which suggests that the primary motivation for exploration was a combination of religious and imperial ambitions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cortez's actions, including punishing the Indian for cannibalism and emphasizing the authority of the Spanish crown, suggest that he was primarily motivated by personal glory and the pursuit of wealth. However, his mention of protecting lives and teaching about a single God hints at a broader motivation: spreading Christianity and converting indigenous people to the faith.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'indulgences', which were a practice criticized by Calvin and other religious leaders, as they believed it allowed people to buy their way out of punishment for sins in the Catholic Church. This was an abuse of power and a distortion of the true nature of salvation, which is a gift from God alone, as stated in the passage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nepotism, the practice of favoring relatives in appointments and positions of power, was not a major concern for Calvin and other religious reformers during the Reformation. While they criticized the Catholic Church for various issues, nepotism was not one of them.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the argument for the Earth being spherical, with evidence from observations of celestial bodies and their movements. This supports option B: 'the Earth is spherical'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Copernicus challenged the traditional view of the universe by proposing that the Earth, like other celestial bodies, is spherical in shape, which contradicted the prevailing belief in a flat Earth. This suggestion was a groundbreaking idea at the time and supported his theory that the Earth is not stationary but rather revolves around the Sun.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote suggests that there was religious tolerance in ancient Rome, which might indicate a lack of strict religious doctrine or an absence of state-sanctioned religion. This could be evidence against the idea of a strong, centralized religious institution controlling scholarship and knowledge, supporting choice A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gibbon's interpretation of religious beliefs in ancient Rome reflects the control of the clergy over academic scholarship in eighteenth-century Britain, where religious authorities dictated the acceptable interpretations of historical events. This suggests that the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Medici family founded and supported the Florentine Academy, which was focused on Plato's philosophy. This indicates a preference for Platonism, or Neoplatonism, in their schools.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Medici family's support for the study of Plato aligns with the Neoclassical movement, which emphasized the revival of classical Greek and Roman art and philosophy. This movement is characterized by its focus on humanism and the pursuit of knowledge, which fits with the text's mention of the Medici-founded Academy's dedication to studying antiquity.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Locke believed that a government loses its legitimacy when it violates the trust of the people by exercising absolute power over their lives and liberties, as outlined in the text. This clearly indicates corruption or an abuse of power, which is contrary to the original purpose of the government.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke is clearly saying that a government loses its legitimacy when it becomes weak and susceptible to being overthrown by the people. This is because a weak government cannot protect the people, which goes against the purpose of a government as stated in the passage.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Calvin, a reference to John Calvin and his religious beliefs. The passage also mentions the destruction of those who supported adult baptism and pacifism, which aligns with the Huguenots' beliefs. Therefore, the answer is A: Huguenots.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lutherans, with their emphasis on adult baptism and pacifism, were often persecuted for their beliefs, leading to their decline. The Huguenots, who shared similar views on these practices, also faced opposition and eventually lost influence. Presbyterians, while having some similarities, emerged later and had a different historical trajectory. Anabaptists, on the other hand, were associated with adult baptism but did not necessarily advocate pacifism to the same extent as the other groups mentioned.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848, a year that saw a wave of revolutions across Europe. This document became a rallying cry for revolutionary movements and sparked a shift in the political landscape, leading to the establishment of communist parties and labor unions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto's publication coincided with a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe, as both challenged established power structures. While it sparked revolutions and influenced the latter, these events are not directly mentioned in the text.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The French Revolution brought about significant changes to the political system, with a shift towards increased popular participation in politics (Answer C). This is evident from Article 21, which emphasizes that no tax can be imposed without the consent of the representatives of the people, indicating a direct say for citizens in fiscal matters.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The grievances clearly point to a desire for a constitutional monarchy, limiting the king's power and ensuring representation for the people. This is the only option that directly leads to increased popular participation in politics while also addressing the issue of royal power.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the distribution of gold among soldiers, with some being deprived of their share due to gambling and the threat of punishment. This suggests a power imbalance and a lack of trust, which could lead to decentralized decision-making as individuals seek to protect their interests without central authority. This is supported by the mention of 'old and ugly women' being left for the soldiers, indicating a lack of value placed on female companions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of gold from the Americas would have stimulated agricultural production as it increased demand for food and resources. This could lead to a strengthened agricultural sector, which is the most likely consequence of the actions described in the memoir.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy of 1534 granted Henry VIII, and his heirs, the position of the Supreme Head of the Church of England, effectively making him the head of the established church. This act was done to increase 'virtue in Christ's religion' and suppress errors and abuses within the church, indicating a desire to reform and purify religious practices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Act of Supremacy aimed to solidify Henry VIII's position as the head of the Church of England, ending the Pope's influence and preventing future monarchs from challenging this authority. This act was a statement of the English Parliament's intent to assert control over the church and establish Henry as its supreme leader, with the power to reform and suppress errors and abuses within it.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the negative impact of industrialization on workers, particularly those employed in the woolen industry. It highlights how the introduction of scribbling-machines has led to job losses and economic distress for the petitioners and their families. This suggests a trend of technological displacement of labor during the industrial era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The petition reflects a shift in cultural values, with workers resisting the new machines and longing for a simpler, more traditional way of life. This is evident in their concern for their families' livelihoods and their desire to protect the next generation from idleness and vagrancy.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'The White Man's Burden' by Rudyard Kipling is often interpreted as a critique of American imperialism in the Philippines, where he warns about the challenges and potential consequences of trying to impose Western values on non-Western cultures. The message can be seen as a reminder that colonial endeavors come with great responsibility and that force or coercion may not lead to positive outcomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kipling's poem encourages Americans to embrace their Christian duty and spread their faith to the 'heathen' populations they encounter in the Philippines. This interpretation aligns with the historical context of American imperialism, where the US sought to impose its values and culture on other nations.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the importance of a woman's role in managing a household and implies that this is the main topic of 'Book of Household Management'. This book would be about the practical skills and knowledge needed to run a household, which aligns with option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Beeton's book seems to be a guide for running a school for domestic servants, providing instruction on proper household management and etiquette. This is evident from the passage, which mentions that the 'whole establishment' will reflect the leader's spirit and that knowledge of household duties is essential for the well-being of the family.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a severe famine in Normandy, France, in 1651, where people were reduced to eating mice, roots, and even the bodies of dead animals due to a lack of food. This suggests that the root cause of their hunger is not the elimination of the Black Plague or the agricultural revolution, as mentioned in options A and B. Instead, it is likely that the problem lies in the absence of adequate food supplies, which could be attributed to factors like poor harvests, natural disasters, or economic crises. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option D, which mentions a declining population during the seventeenth century, leading to better food yields and reduced hunger as Europe urbanized.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The hunger described is likely a consequence of the Black Plague, which devastated populations and disrupted food production systems. This would have led to a decline in food supplies and an increase in population pressure, causing widespread famine. While the Agricultural Revolution improved yields, it didn't address the immediate issue of food scarcity and population pressure.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the thoughts and concerns of a character, Souvarine, who has given up his wealth and position to join the working class with the hope of creating a society based on common labor. He criticizes the idea of individuals winning large sums of money through luck and then hoarding it for themselves instead of sharing it with those less fortunate. This reflects communist ideals, which emphasize the collective ownership and equitable distribution of resources for the betterment of society as a whole.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage reflects the scientific movement's emphasis on observation and experimentation to understand and improve the lives of the working class. While the other movements mentioned also advocate for the welfare of the working classes, the Scientific movement specifically emphasizes a data-driven approach.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'the fruits of sin' and how God condemns those who are corrupt, indicating a belief in original sin and the need for salvation through faith alone (justification by faith), which is a key Protestant doctrine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Calvin's arguments suggest that religion should be used to challenge the authority of earthly monarchs and establish a more just and equitable society. This aligns with the idea of using religion as a tool for social change, which is a key aspect of the Protestant Reformation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote mentions 'the last law of nature', which suggests that it is referring to a philosophical or moral principle, and Voltaire's work was heavily influenced by the Enlightenment movement, which emphasized reason and tolerance. So, the correct answer is C: The Enlightenment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's call for tolerance and understanding aligns with the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and emotional connection. The Romantic movement, known for its focus on emotions and nature, would be the most suitable cultural movement that Voltaire was participating in.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Ferrera (1438) was a significant event that brought together Eastern and Western church leaders to discuss philosophical differences, with the Byzantines advocating for Plato over Aristotle. This council is mentioned in the context of the rise of humanism and the study of classical philosophy in Florence, Italy, which suggests that it accelerated the rediscovery of ancient texts and ideas in Western Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Council of Ferrera facilitated the exchange of knowledge between Florence and Byzantium, allowing the Byzantines to benefit from Florentine scholarship and advancements. This suggests that the council accelerated the spread of classical philosophy in Western Europe, as it brought ancient texts and ideas to a wider audience.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the initial interactions between Christopher Columbus and the indigenous people of Hispaniola, where he attempts to barter with them for goods while also attempting to convert them to Christianity. This was followed by the description of the Spanish treatment of these people, which included torture and murder, leading to a significant decline in their population. The Columbian Exchange refers to the exchange of plants, animals, and goods between Europe and the Americas, which had a profound impact on both sides. Therefore, the correct answer is that it created economic opportunities for Europeans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The influx of goods and resources from the Americas would have saturated European markets and limited economic opportunities for existing industries. This exchange also led to the destruction and subjugation of indigenous populations, as seen in the excerpts, as the Europeans sought wealth and resources.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that 'all letters de cachet' are abolished, which was a common method of arbitrary arrest and detention. This indicates a move towards more transparency and protection of personal liberty, which is the opposite of what de-Christianization or fixing prices and wages would achieve.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's decision to conscript large armies weakened France's defense by depleting resources and creating internal dissent. While all options are detrimental, this action had the most significant negative impact on the country's ability to defend itself during the Revolution.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the wealth and prosperity of Florence, with a focus on its thriving trade in wool and silk, indicating a strong economy and cultural importance. This suggests that the city takes pride in its economic power and artistic achievements during the Renaissance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage exemplifies the chivalric ideals of the Renaissance, with its focus on honor, valor, and the pursuit of glory through warfare and competition. This is reflected in the mention of military prowess and the mention of Florence's superior trade and wealth, which suggests a sense of civic pride and the patronage of the arts to maintain this status.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the author's feelings about the unification of Italy, which was a complex process that involved the incorporation of various regions, including Sicily, into a single kingdom. The author expresses a sense of sadness and loss regarding the end of Rome's 'ecumenical position' and traditions as it became the capital of the Italian kingdom. This suggests a conservative perspective, as the author laments the loss of historical continuity and the shift in power dynamics. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Conservatism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The author's bittersweet feelings reflect the Romantic movement's emphasis on individual expression and the yearning for a simpler, more authentic past. The quote mentions how Rome's 'Imperial traditions' were cast aside, which aligns with the Romantic movement's rejection of societal norms and embrace of nature and emotion. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Romanticism.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the argument made by Thomas Henry Huxley in his 1868 work, where he discusses the physical basis of life and its composition. He argues that life, as we understand it, breaks down into simple compounds like carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous substances, which are ordinary matter. This suggests that life is essentially a property or phenomenon associated with these matter-based compounds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Huxley suggests that 'life' is a force that works through matter, animating and directing its processes, rather than being solely a property of matter itself. This view aligns with the idea of life as a physical process, where matter plays a fundamental role in its manifestation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a group of people meeting regularly to discuss various topics in philosophy, science, and mathematics, excluding theology and state affairs. This suggests that they formed an independent society dedicated to the study of natural philosophy, which was a new and emerging field at the time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Church's role in fostering the study of natural philosophy, providing a platform for scholars to share their findings and engage in theological debates. While the text mentions various topics that were discussed, such as astronomy, physics, and mechanics, it primarily highlights the exclusion of theological and state-related matters from their discussions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus was a scholar and writer who sought to make classical knowledge accessible to the masses, particularly the educated upper classes. He wanted to democratize learning and share the 'spirit of antiquity' with as many people as possible. This goal is similar to that of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the printing press, who revolutionized the dissemination of knowledge by making books more widely available.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Erasmus and Martin Luther were both key figures in challenging the established authority of the Catholic Church and advocating for religious reform. While they had different approaches, both sought to make knowledge more accessible to the masses, which aligns with Huizinga's description of Erasmus' desire to bring the 'spirit of antiquity' to a wider audience.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Plato's philosophy gained prominence over Aristotle's during the 15th century due to Byzantine scholarship, indicating a shift in intellectual focus towards ancient Greek thought and away from medieval scholasticism. This aligns with option C, as it suggests that philosophers in the 20th century sought to distinguish their ideas from those of past thinkers, particularly in light of the devastating effects of World Wars I and II.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Russell's highlighting of the humanists' inability to produce anything of value aligns with a nihilistic perspective, where meaning and progress are deemed unattainable. This view is reflected in choice D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote describes a method of inquiry that involves starting from specific observations and gradually ascending to more general principles, which aligns with the definition of empiricism. Empiricism emphasizes the role of sensory experience and observation in knowledge acquisition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bacon's method, with its focus on empirical evidence and the collective advancement of knowledge, shares similarities with the core tenets of scientific socialism. While the term 'scientific socialism' may not be as widely used today, it aligns with the spirit of Bacon's approach to inquiry. This method is often associated with a more structured and systematic approach to knowledge discovery, which is reflected in the text.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Queen Victoria's busy schedule of social engagements, indicating that she had a lot of commitments and obligations as part of her role in the English monarchy at the time. This suggests that true political power may have been held elsewhere, potentially by those who controlled the monarchy or held influential positions outside of the royal family.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Queen Victoria's packed schedule of social engagements indicates that the 19th century in England was a time of prosperity and leisure for the upper classes, allowing for extensive social activities. This suggests that true political power may have been held elsewhere, as the monarchy primarily served as a figurehead during this period.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text is a quote from Pico della Mirandola's 'Oration on the Dignity of Man', written in 1486, which celebrates human potential and freedom, values central to Renaissance humanism. This movement emphasized individualism and the belief in human capacity for greatness, fitting with the tone and content of the quote.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Pico's ideas about human potential and the ability to shape one's own destiny resonate with the spirit of the Scientific Revolution, which emphasized human reason and the pursuit of knowledge. However, his writing also aligns with the Renaissance's focus on humanism and the celebration of human achievements, making this the most suitable answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes events from the Conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo's memoirs, which took place during the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century. This was a significant event in history and is closely associated with modern-day Mexico.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors were primarily focused on exploring and conquering regions in South America known for their abundance of gold, such as Peru. The passage mentions the conquest of Mexico and the subsequent division of wealth, including gold, among soldiers. This suggests that the events took place in Mexico.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a call to arms and mobilization of all French citizens, regardless of age or gender, to contribute to the war effort against enemies of the Republic. This suggests a collective, nation-wide commitment to warfare, indicating a turning point in modern European history towards total war and a shift from traditional, more selective mobilization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's rhetoric of driving the enemy from the Republic's soil and preaching hatred of kings suggests an intent to completely eliminate the opposing forces. This is a radical shift in warfare, moving away from previous concepts of 'total war' and towards a more extreme form where civilians are also involved in the fight. Thus, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the distribution of gold among soldiers, indicating a power dynamic and an economic policy that favors those in power. This suggests a mercantilist approach, which prioritizes the accumulation of wealth and resources by the state or ruling class.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The conquistadors' relentless pursuit of gold and personal enrichment aligns with the principles of laissez-faire economics, where individual self-interest drives economic activity. This philosophy contrasts with protectionism, which involves state intervention to favor domestic industries, and mercantilism, which focuses on trade balance and the accumulation of precious metals. While supply-side policies aim to increase the supply of goods and services, they do not directly fit the context of the text, as the focus is primarily on the conquistadors' behavior.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the actions of Chartists, a movement advocating for universal suffrage, which was their primary goal as they sought to include all men in political decision-making, regardless of social class or property ownership. Universal suffrage refers to the right to vote for all adults, and the text mentions that Chartists opposed the exclusion of working men from this right.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Chartists advocated for 'Household Suffrage,' which implies a goal of extending voting rights to all adult members of a household, regardless of gender. This was in contrast to the existing system that excluded many working-class men. While the excerpt mentions 'the political portion of the working people,' it does not specifically mention universal health care or social security, and the term 'suffrage' refers to the right to vote, not these social programs.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions several scientists and institutions, but it primarily highlights the work of anthropologists and biologists at the Paris Exposition, especially during the Congresses and sessions. This suggests that these fields were central to the event. Thus, the answer is most likely an anthropologist or biologist who contributed significantly to the field during this time period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The scientists at the Paris Exposition, with their interest in human diversity and evolution, would have likely drawn inspiration from Alfred Nobel's work on dynamite and its potential to reshape human societies. While Darwin's theory of evolution was well-known, it may not have had a direct impact on their specific field of study as much as Nobel's practical application of science.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Navigation Acts of 1651, which restricted foreign trade and limited the movement of goods. This suggests that the outcome was a shift in power away from foreign nations, particularly the Dutch, who were major players in overseas trade at the time. This would have had negative economic impacts on them, leading to hardships as their dominance ended.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Navigation Acts, by directly targeting Dutch dominance in shipping and trade, would have caused immediate and significant economic difficulties for the Netherlands. This was a primary goal of the English, so much so that they were willing to go to war over it, as seen in the subsequent century-long conflict between the two nations. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that the need for Perestroika had been a long-standing issue, and Gorbachev argued that delay would lead to social, economic, and political crises. This indicates that the need for change was not sudden but rather an urgent necessity that had been building up over time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gorbachev's urgency in implementing perestroika suggests that the need for reform was a recent development, rather than a long-standing issue within Soviet society. This is indicated by his use of the phrase 'profound processes of development' and the implication that any delay would lead to an 'exacerbated internal situation'. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'the need for perestroika was long in the making'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a group of people interested in various scientific topics, including physics, astronomy, and philosophy. They avoided discussing theology or state affairs, indicating that their main interest was in secular knowledge without any religious or political implications.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wallis's group, with its emphasis on the 'New Philosophy' and its exploration of topics like the Copernican hypothesis, was likely motivated by a desire to challenge and dismantle the traditional, Church-centered worldview. This suggests an interest in undermining religious doctrine.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The petitioners argue that the introduction of scribbling-machines has led to widespread unemployment, leaving many people unable to support their families. They also mention that these machines are more productive than human workers, indicating an assumption that increased productivity leads to economic growth and prosperity for all.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The authors' emphasis on the difficulties of providing for families suggests that having a large family was seen as a positive economic factor, as it meant more hands to contribute to the household income. This assumption is in contrast to choice C, which assumes that large families are economically disadvantageous.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the measures taken by the French Republic during the early stages of the French Revolution, specifically the Lev\u00e9e en Masse, which called for a total mobilization of the population to support the war effort against the Coalition. This includes all able-bodied citizens, regardless of age or gender, contributing to the war in various ways, such as fighting, forging arms, providing provisions, and manufacturing tents and clothing for the troops. The text also mentions the Committee of Public Safety being tasked with establishing an extraordinary armory and recruiting artists and workers to contribute to the war effort. Thus, the correct answer is D, mass conscription.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage, with its detailed instructions for the Committee of Public Safety, suggests that this document was instrumental in establishing the committee and defining its powers. This is indicated by the use of 'it' referring to the committee in the last sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is B: the Committee of Public Safety.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt supports the demand for religious tolerance and skepticism, as it emphasizes the belief in one God and the importance of individual reasoning (skepticism) over blind faith. It also criticizes organized religion and its role in oppressing individuals, advocating for their rights to hold their own beliefs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's unwavering belief in his own religious views and his dismissal of other churches suggests a distrust of skepticism and critical examination of information, particularly in matters of faith. This aligns with the demand for skepticism to be unreliable, as it challenges the very foundation of his beliefs.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's speech emphasizes the need for rapid industrialization and technical advancement to maintain a socialist regime. This suggests that he wants to eliminate any compromise or deviation from the communist ideal, which is option C. Option D is not mentioned in the excerpt, so it cannot be the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's concerns about the coexistence of socialist industry and a small-commodity peasant economy likely stem from the earlier compromise of freeing the peasants from their landlords, which created a decentralized agricultural system. This could lead to an uneven development of industry and agriculture, potentially threatening the stability of the socialist regime. The correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the mining industry grew in importance after the invention of the steam engine, which is option C. This was a significant development in industrial revolution-era Europe, and it led to increased mechanization and efficiency in the mining sector.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of the mining industry, as depicted in the passage, is closely linked to the development of the internal combustion engine, which revolutionized the extraction and transportation of minerals. This technological advancement enabled more efficient and extensive mining operations, leading to the growth of the mining sector.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Erasmus' work made the spirit of antiquity accessible to a wider audience, which directly contradicts the notion that 'Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of the few'. This indicates that the primary impact was that Latin became more widely used, as it was now accessible to those who did not have an extensive classical education.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As humanism became more accessible to the wider population, it empowered individuals to question authority and demand greater rights and representation from the state. This shift in knowledge and power dynamics led to a more democratic society with increased demands for change, which ultimately played a significant role in the Age of Reformation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the wealth and trade of Florence in the Renaissance, with a focus on the number and value of shops and warehouses, indicating that wealth was measured by the quantity and monetary value of goods produced and traded.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In Renaissance Italy, with its focus on trade and commerce, the primary measure of wealth would have been the amount of gold an individual or city possessed, reflecting their economic power and influence. While estates were important, they were more a sign of status and land ownership, not necessarily direct measures of monetary value. The text mentions the monetary value of goods produced by these estates, but it is the gold mentioned as being of primary importance.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 'Nihilists', a group that believed in the absence of meaning or purpose in life, and their goal was to overthrow the Russian government. This does not align with the other options mentioned, which are political movements or figures associated with anarchism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, a prominent socialist thinker, advocated for workers' self-management and criticized capitalism, aligning with anarchist principles. The passage mentions that the radical movement, anarchism, was related to Proudhon's ideas, but not to the International Workingman's Association (a labor organization) or the Congress of Vienna (an international diplomatic conference). The Paris Commune, while having anarchist influences, is also mentioned separately in the text.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote describes the diverse religious practices in ancient Rome, indicating that they were decentralized and varied among different social classes. This suggests a lack of centralized control over religious matters, which aligns with a heterogeneous religious landscape.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The philosopher's dismissal of all Roman religions as 'equally false' suggests a centralized religious authority overseeing a uniform belief system. This is contrary to the diverse and decentralized nature of ancient Roman religion, indicating that the statement accurately reflects the situation at the time.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Thomas Paine's beliefs, which align with Enlightenment ideals. He rejected organized religion and advocated for individual freedom of thought, a key principle of the Enlightenment. His ideas emphasized rationality and the rejection of established religious institutions as tools of control. This aligns with the characteristic of 'rejection of traditional authority' that is inherent in Enlightenment thought.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Paine's reliance on reason as a tool against errors and his dismissal of various religious institutions aligns with the scientific approach of Enlightenment thinkers. His statement about having 'my own church' indicates that he values individual reasoning over organized religion, which is a key characteristic of the Enlightenment.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the impact of European colonization on the indigenous population of Hispaniola, where their numbers decreased from three million to just two hundred due to Spanish exploitation for gold and wealth. This suggests that the native population was subjugated and destroyed, with economic opportunities being reduced as a result of colonial practices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Columbus' efforts to prevent unfair bartering and his provision of goods without demanding anything in return suggest the creation of economic opportunities for the indigenous people. On the other hand, de las Casas' description of the Spanish treatment of natives as 'savage lions' and their destruction of the population indicates subjugation and destruction. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, a prominent philosopher during the Age of Enlightenment, advocated for a government that upheld the natural rights of individuals and limited the power of the state to protect those rights. He opposed absolute monarchy (divine right monarchy) and believed in a system where the power is vested in the people and exercised through representatives, thus favoring constitutionalism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's argument that the ruler's power is derived from the people and aimed at their preservation aligns with the concept of divine right, where monarchs are chosen by God to rule and protect their subjects. This suggests an advocate for 'divine right monarchy'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. While all the skills mentioned are valuable, the passage emphasizes that a courtier should be well-versed in multiple languages, particularly Latin and Greek, as they were considered essential for access to knowledge and culture at the time. The other options, such as physical strength, weapon expertise, and music, are seen as complementary to these intellectual skills. Therefore, expertise with multiple languages would likely be valued the least by a modern gentleman, as it is no longer a rare or unique skill set.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While physical prowess and social graces remain important, the emphasis on classical education and multiple languages might be considered less relevant in the late 20th century with the rise of technology and globalization. The ability to communicate and navigate diverse cultures is still valuable, but expertise in ancient languages may not be as essential as it once was.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Lenin's concerns about the Soviet Union's economic development, emphasizing the need for rapid industrialization to support the socialist system. Stalin's efforts aimed to address this issue, and the result was a period of rapid industrialization coupled with collectivization in agriculture, which had mixed results. While industry grew, agriculture suffered, leading to a severe man-made famine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. By prioritizing industrial development and modernizing agriculture, Stalin's policies aimed to achieve balanced and steady growth in both sectors of the Soviet economy. This is evident from the provided excerpt, where he emphasizes the necessity of a 'fast rate of development' for industry and the gradual improvement of agriculture's technical basis. The result was likely a shift towards a more unified and productive economic system, leading to overall progress.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how children from wealthy families are often attracted to 'plebeian' occupations due to their natural inclinations, but civilized education and the unsavory nature of such jobs deter them. This suggests that the groups advocating for universal male suffrage were those who believed in giving power to the common people, which aligns with the 'Luddites'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fourier's description of the attraction of manual labor for children and the negative impact of industrial conditions on their development aligns with the Luddite movement's resistance to machinery and its effects on workers. The Luddites were a group that opposed technological advancements and the use of machinery, particularly in the textile industry, which would align with Fourier's description of the repugnance towards the filthiness and coarseness of workshops. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
