C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the process by which the body adjusts its internal temperature when exposed to cold temperatures. It involves an increase in heat production, often through shivering or non-shivering thermogenesis, to maintain a normal body temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 'A decrease in non-shivering thermogenesis when exposed to cold'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's way of adjusting to cold temperatures, and one way it does this is by decreasing non-essential heat production like non-shivering thermogenesis. So, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to improve child development outcomes, particularly in low-income countries where protein and energy intake may be inadequate. Protein-energy supplementation during the first two years of life is also beneficial for child growth and development, but it is typically not as effective as during pregnancy when the growing fetus requires additional protein for development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that interventions during pregnancy, like protein-energy supplementation, have a significant impact on child development by providing essential nutrients during critical growth stages. This is especially true for the first two years after birth, when children experience rapid growth and brain development.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Weight maintenance requires a balanced diet that maintains energy intake at a level consistent with the individual's current weight and physical activity level. A low-protein, low-GI diet is often recommended for weight maintenance as it tends to be lower in calories and can help manage blood sugar levels, which is crucial for maintaining a stable energy balance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maintain weight, we need to avoid foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, so a low-protein, high-GI diet would be appropriate as it promotes slower digestion and prevents excessive insulin release. This is the opposite of what is described in option B.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycaemic index is a measure of how much a food raises blood glucose levels relative to a reference food, typically white bread. It is a comparison of the effect on blood sugar levels after eating a certain food.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycemic index measures how quickly a food raises blood insulin levels compared to a reference food like white bread, reflecting the food's impact on insulin demand. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to absorb zinc, leading to its deficiency. This condition is characterized by skin lesions and gastrointestinal issues, and it is the correct answer as it directly leads to zinc deficiency.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wilson's disease disrupts the body's ability to process trace minerals, leading to imbalances like zinc deficiency, which can manifest in various symptoms. Menkes disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the absorption and transport of zinc, resulting in its deficiency. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the cells responsible for absorbing zinc, leading to its deficiency. Hemochromatosis, on the other hand, is a condition where excess iron is absorbed, which can interfere with zinc absorption but would typically result in high zinc levels rather than low.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization can lead to higher poverty rates due to job insecurity and lack of skills for the uneducated, making it harder to find stable work. This can result in food insecurity and malnutrition, especially among the low-income population. Additionally, the cost of living in cities is often higher, which can further strain access to nutritious and affordable food options.",A,Let's reason step by step. Urbanization doesn't significantly affect hunger and malnutrition because both urban and rural low-income populations face similar challenges in accessing nutritious food and often rely on comparable diets. The answer is A.,A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals into less harmful substances, but it relies on copper and manganese as cofactors rather than zinc. Therefore, it is not a zinc-dependent enzyme.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Alkaline phosphatase is crucial for bone health, and zinc is known to play a role in bone development and maintenance, so it's logical that alkaline phosphatase would be a zinc-dependent enzyme. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are both antioxidants that protect cells from oxidative stress, but they don't require zinc for their function. DNA polymerase, on the other hand, is essential for DNA replication and repair, but its activity isn't directly linked to zinc in the same way as the other two enzymes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 5' end of a DNA molecule is the end with the 5' phosphate group, and it is typically the end that is attached to the DNA polymerase during replication or transcription. The 5'-end of a mRNA transcript is also known as the 'cap'. In this case, we are looking for the nucleotide base that is methylated at the 5' position, which would be adenosine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Guanine forms base pairs with cytosine in DNA, and since cytosine methylation is common, it follows that guanine would also be methylated at the 5' position for proper pairing and stability. ",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two most common causes of foodborne illness in the US and Europe are Salmonella and Campylobacter, with Shigella and Staphylococcus being less prevalent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Shigella and Staphylococcus are both bacteria commonly found in contaminated food and are known to cause gastrointestinal illness, making them likely culprits for foodborne outbreaks. While all the options are common causes of foodborne illnesses, Shigella and Staphylococcus are the most prevalent.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery has been shown to significantly reduce the risk and incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. Studies have consistently reported a reduction in the incidence of diabetes, with some indicating an approximately 50% reduction. While some studies show higher reductions, around 80-90%, it is important to consider that these figures are often combined with other health improvements, and the specific impact on diabetes may vary depending on individual factors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control, so it's reasonable to expect a reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence by approximately 50%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization can be a double-edged sword when it comes to food security. While it can provide access to new markets and technologies, it can also disrupt local agriculture and food systems. Trade barriers and subsidies in wealthy countries may hinder developing nations' ability to compete, affecting their food security. However, the World Trade Organization's rules do cover agriculture to some extent, providing a framework for fair trade practices that can benefit all members. Supermarkets are indeed a key player in globalized food distribution, but they don't inherently improve food security if local farmers cannot compete.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expansion of supermarkets into developing countries is the primary way globalization affects food security, as it introduces new food options and distribution channels. While wealthy countries' subsidies and trade barriers hinder developing nations' ability to fully benefit from globalized markets, this effect is indirect and does not directly impact food security on a local level. The World Trade Organization's rules covering agriculture do provide some structure but are not the primary driver of change in this domain. Creating publicly-owned food reserves is a strategy that may help, but it is not a direct consequence of globalization itself.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nutrients can pose health risks when their intakes exceed the established Upper Limits (ULs) or recommended dietary allowances, indicating potential toxicity. While excessive intakes are generally considered the primary concern, some nutrients may also be harmful at any level greater than what is required for optimal health, as seen with vitamin A and D, where deficiencies can have severe health consequences.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Any nutrient intake exceeding the recommended levels can pose health risks because it disrupts the body's balance and can lead to toxicity or other adverse effects. While options A and B are correct, option C is not necessary for this statement as it is an extreme case that is not typically considered a risk for most nutrients.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is involved in the transamination of amino acids, which is a crucial process in metabolism. It acts as a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions that convert amino acids into useful energy for the body.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is essential for energy production, and since amino acids can be used for energy, it's likely that riboflavin plays a role in amino acid transamination to facilitate their utilization as an energy source. So, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Maternal weight gain is an important factor in pregnancy as it impacts both the mother's health and that of the fetus. Research aims to determine the ideal range for weight gain, while excessive weight gain can lead to obesity in the child later in life. Additionally, inadequate weight gain can also result in poor outcomes for both mother and baby.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While research on optimal weight gain patterns is ongoing, it's clear that inadequate weight gain poses greater risks to maternal and infant health, as it can lead to nutrient deficiencies and developmental problems. Additionally, excessive weight gain during pregnancy has been linked to the development of obesity in the child later in life. Therefore, both statements B and C are true.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Elite athletes require a substantial amount of energy during prolonged high-intensity exercise to maintain performance. Glucose is the primary source of fuel for the body, and fructose provides an additional source of energy. Consuming 60 g of glucose per hour is ideal as it matches the body's demand for energy during this duration of exercise, while the addition of fructose in option B may provide a slight advantage by providing an alternative fuel source. Therefore, the most suitable answer is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the primary fuel source for high-intensity exercise, so elite athletes should aim to consume around 60 grams of glucose per hour to maintain energy levels during prolonged activity. Fructose, while also a simple sugar, is primarily used by the liver and has a different metabolic path than glucose. Consuming just fructose may not provide the body with the necessary fuel for sustained high-intensity exercise.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question specifically asks for the FIVE main series of apoproteins, and we know that there are typically five major types: apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and apoL (or apoM in some sources). Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The five main apoprotein series are involved in lipid transport and metabolism, so it makes sense that they would include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and apoL, which are all associated with lipoproteins. While apoM is also a lipoprotein, it is not one of the primary series identified thus far.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) and net protein utilization (NPU) assays are used to evaluate the protein quality of diets for animals, particularly rats. While these assays can provide insights into protein quality for animal nutrition, they may not directly translate to human nutrition due to differences in metabolic processes and nutritional requirements. Therefore, the statement that 'animal growth assays underestimate the quality of dietary proteins for human nutrition' is incorrect, as it fails to consider the limitations of these assays specifically for human nutritional assessments.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) assay is a reliable method for assessing protein quality because it directly measures the ability of a protein to support growth in rats, which have similar protein needs to humans. While animal growth assays can be used as a model, they may not always accurately represent human protein quality due to differences in metabolism and other factors. The rat net protein utilization (NPU) assay is not commonly used for assessing human protein quality directly.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries, or tooth decay, is primarily caused by bacteria that produce acid from sugars in the mouth, leading to demineralization of enamel and dentin. Among the options, only *Mutans streptococci* is known for producing significant amounts of acid, making it the primary culprit in dental caries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lactobacilli thrive in acidic environments and are known to ferment sugars, producing lactic acid as a byproduct, which directly contributes to the demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of dental caries. Thus, lactobacilli is primarily responsible for the initiation of dental caries.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lean body mass loss and reduced physical activity are common in older adults, which can lead to a decrease in energy expenditure. Basal metabolic rate also tends to slow down with age, further reducing energy needs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason for reduced energy expenditure in older adults is the loss of lean body mass, as muscle tissue is metabolically active and contributes significantly to daily calorie burning. Additionally, a decrease in physical activity further reduces overall energy needs. While basal metabolic rate also plays a role, it is typically not the primary factor in this age group.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein-energy malnutrition, and while iron deficiency can cause anemia and other health issues, it is not typically associated with the specific symptoms of kwashiorkor, which is characterized by edemas (swelling due to fluid retention) and stunting. While sudden weaning from breast milk can be an issue, it doesn't directly lead to the oedema specifically seen in kwashiorkor. Antioxidant nutrients are important for overall health, but they don't typically cause or prevent oedema. The altered composition of intestinal bacteria can impact digestion and nutrient absorption, but it's not a direct cause of the specific edema seen in kwashiorkor.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is often triggered by sudden weaning from breast milk, as the child's diet becomes deficient in protein and essential nutrients, leading to edema and other characteristic symptoms. While iron deficiency can cause anemia and impact overall health, it does not directly cause edema specific to kwashiorkor. Antioxidant nutrient intake may be a factor in overall health, but it doesn't specifically contribute to the edema unique to kwashiorkor. Altered intestinal bacteria could potentially influence the development of kwashiorkor through impaired digestion and nutrient absorption, but it is not considered a primary cause.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C, 'Decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle', as it is the only mechanism that is not directly related to the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. While all options are part of the process, option C does not fit the description of the specific mechanism involved in the condition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in lowering blood glucose levels, so increased glucose production by the liver wouldn't contribute to hyperglycemia. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar, so impaired insulin secretion would lead to higher blood sugar levels, not lower.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise is known to reduce blood sugar levels, which can lead to hypoglycemia, not hyperglycemia. Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, and since triglycerides are a type of fat, it makes sense that exercise would also reduce triglycerides. Hypoglycemia is a common side effect of exercise for people with diabetes as they release glucose into the bloodstream to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Insulin sensitivity increases with regular physical activity, which helps regulate blood sugar. Hypertension can be helped by exercise, but it is not directly opposed to it like the other options.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Higher sodium intake is associated with increased fluid retention, which can lead to a negative calcium balance as the body tries to maintain calcium levels in the blood, often resulting in increased calcium excretion. This can contribute to bone mineral loss and an increased risk of fractures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both sodium and calcium are essential minerals involved in various physiological processes, so a higher intake of sodium would naturally lead to increased calcium excretion to maintain balance. This results in a negative calcium balance and potential bone mineral loss.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lipase activity is crucial for breaking down fats, and adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase specifically targets the breakdown of triglycerides in chylomicrons. Insulin, a key hormone in regulating metabolism, promotes this process. Therefore, after a meal, insulin levels rise, activating lipoprotein lipase and leading to a decrease in NEFA concentrations, as well as the hydrolysis of chylomicrons. This cascade of events integrates fat metabolism at the whole-body level.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body prioritizes the breakdown of chylomicrons from dietary fat, so it would make sense that VLDL synthesis is suppressed during this time. Additionally, insulin, which activates adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase, is released in response to a meal, further supporting option B. While option A is also true, only one answer can be chosen, so the most accurate statement is that all three options are correct.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase non-persisters are individuals who do not produce lactase after weaning and experience symptoms of lactose intolerance. Since infants and children are considered lactase persisters, it is safe to assume that the majority of adults are lactase non-persisters. The question mentions that lactase non-persisters make up a significant portion of the population, so we can infer that the percentage of non-persisters is likely in the range given in option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase persistence is quite common, especially in populations with a history of dairy consumption, so the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is likely around 30-35%.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are immune responses to specific foods, and they typically develop after initial exposure to the allergen. This is a type of hypersensitivity reaction, where the body's immune system overreacts to harmless substances. The correct answer is C as food allergies usually occur after sensitization, which is when the body develops immunity to a particular allergen.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are dose-dependent reactions, so as long as the allergic agents are kept within specified limits, they should be avoidable. Food intolerances, on the other hand, are usually not related to specific limits but rather an individual's ability to digest certain foods.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rickets of prematurity is a condition that affects immature babies, often due to vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption and bone development. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that vitamin D deficiency in the mother is a key factor in this condition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Diuretics like frusemide help the body retain calcium, which is essential for bone development, so their use would be associated with a lower risk of rickets. However, vitamin D deficiency and hypocalcaemic convulsions are also known causes of rickets, especially in premature babies. Therefore, all three options are correct.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Colorectal cancer risk is associated with dietary factors, and while vitamin C (vitamin C) is an essential nutrient, it specifically refers to the vitamin C content in fruits and vegetables. Dietary fiber, on the other hand, is a type of carbohydrate that helps prevent constipation and maintain gut health, both of which are linked to reduced colorectal cancer risk. Alcohol consumption is a known risk factor for various types of cancer, including colorectal cancer, and estrogen (estrogen) has been associated with a higher risk of certain types of colorectal cancers in women.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development, so it's likely that it also has a protective effect against cancer development in the colon and rectum. While alcohol consumption can increase the risk of colorectal cancer, estrogens are known to have anti-tumor properties and can even inhibit the progression of precancerous lesions. Therefore, estrogen is the most likely factor that reduces the risk for cancer of the colorectum.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hypertension is a complex condition influenced by various factors, including diet, genetics, and age. While high salt intake can contribute to hypertension, it is not the primary cause in older individuals due to their often-changed physiological characteristics. Therefore, the statement about salt intake and hypertension in older people being unrelated is incorrect.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function and brain health, so it's logical that supplements would improve cognitive function in older people who may have deficiencies. While folate (vitamin B9) is also important for brain health and can be found in leafy greens, the question specifically mentions 'folic acid', which is a synthetic form of folate often added to food, so the statement about its prevalence in fortified flour makes sense. Hypertension is a complex condition influenced by various factors, including salt intake, but it's not as straightforward a relationship as option A suggests. Finally, while older people may have lower hemoglobin levels due to anemia, this doesn't make them 'no more likely' to have low hemoglobin than younger people.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plasma lipoproteins are particles in the blood that transport lipids, specifically cholesterol and triglycerides, to and from the cells. They have a hydrophobic core composed of triglycerides and cholesterol esters, which are water-insoluble, so they require a hydrophobic environment. Therefore, the correct statement is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phospholipids and free cholesterol are both hydrophobic molecules, so it makes sense that they would form the core of lipoproteins, surrounded by a hydrophilic shell. This structure is characteristic of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol carriers due to their association with cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of blood clotting proteins, also known as coagulation factors. It plays a crucial role in the final stage of blood clot formation, preventing excessive bleeding.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which help protect blood vessels and prevent damage, so it's likely involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins. While all vitamins are essential for overall health, only vitamin K specifically plays a crucial role in blood clotting, as it helps the body produce factors that form clots to stop bleeding.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia is a condition where bone mineral density is lower than normal but not at the level of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a more severe form of osteopenia, with an even lower bone mineral density. The statement that 'Fewer than 50% of women over 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis' is the most accurate description of these conditions, as it highlights the prevalence and severity of the latter. Thus, this statement accurately describes the diagnosis of these conditions in North America and Western Europe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia is a relatively uncommon condition, so it's unlikely that more than 10% of women over 50 would have it. Additionally, osteopenia can progress to osteoporosis, which is more common in older adults. The definition of osteoporosis includes having a bone density lower than age-matched controls, and this is true for option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the intestine, so its action would contribute to an increase in plasma calcium concentration. Parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, on the other hand, regulate calcium levels by influencing kidney function, which would lead to changes in plasma calcium concentration. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parathyroid hormone plays a key role in regulating calcium levels, and its action on the kidney helps increase calcium reabsorption to maintain blood calcium concentration. Calcitonin, on the other hand, is a hormone that lowers calcium levels in the blood by promoting urinary excretion. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance and weight. A congenital disorder impairing leptin secretion would lead to an imbalance in energy homeostasis, resulting in obesity or underweight depending on the specific nature of the impairment. The presence of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism indicates a different phenotype as these are not directly related to leptin regulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin signals satiety and reduces appetite, so a deficiency would result in excess energy intake and obesity, but growth and insulin levels should remain normal. The correct answer is option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Deuterium (H$_2$^$1$$^2$D) is a stable isotope of hydrogen that is often used in scientific studies related to water and biological systems. It has a natural abundance of about 0.036%, which makes it a convenient tracer for studying water dynamics, especially in aquatic ecosystems and human physiology.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carbon 13 is a stable isotope often used in metabolic studies, so it's likely the preferred choice for measuring total body water due to its abundance and ease of detection. ",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Tooth enamel starts to dissolve when the pH drops below 5.5, which is the critical point for demineralization. This process is often referred to as 'acid erosion' and can be caused by various factors like dietary habits and acidic beverages.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tooth enamel starts to demineralize at a pH below neutral 7, and considering the acidic environment of the mouth, the critical pH is likely around 5.7. This is when the enamel becomes vulnerable to decay.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) is calculated as the ratio of oxygen consumption (VO2) to carbon dioxide production (VCO2). A higher RQ indicates a greater reliance on fatty acids for energy, which can occur during fasting or when carbohydrate intake is low. Therefore, option C is correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) measures the ratio of oxygen consumed (VO2) to carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) during metabolism. It is used to understand how the body utilizes energy sources, with a value above 1 indicating a preference for fat as an energy source and a value below 1 suggesting carbohydrate or glucose dominance.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Raw food items like apples and potatoes are generally considered to have a lower glycaemic index compared to processed fruit juices, as they undergo less rapid digestion and absorption in the body.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Raw fruits typically have more fiber and are digested more slowly than cooked fruits, so a raw apple would have a lower glycemic index than a baked apple. Potatoes are starchy vegetables with a high glycemic index due to their starch content. Apple juice is a liquid and doesn't contain the same complex carbohydrates as solid foods, so it has a very low glycemic index.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. People with infections or inflammation may have altered dietary habits and metabolic processes, which can lead to misleading results in biochemical tests for micronutrient status. This is because their body's nutrient requirements might change during these states, affecting the interpretation of test results.",C,"Let's reason step by step. People who are sick often experience changes in appetite and dietary intake, which can directly affect their micronutrient status and lead to misleading results in biochemical tests. Additionally, certain metabolic pathways are altered during illness, further complicating the interpretation of micronutrient levels.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies can identify health effects of food contaminants but not assess risks because it is challenging to establish a causal relationship between the contaminant exposure and the observed health effects. This is due to the potential for confounding variables and reverse causation, where pre-existing conditions or other factors could influence both the exposure and the health outcome, blurring the link to the contaminant.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies are inherently limited by their inability to control for all confounding factors, so it's impossible to definitively prove that observed effects are caused by the contaminant in question. This makes risk assessment challenging.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Sedentary individuals require less energy as they are not physically active. For a 43-year-old woman weighing 63 kg, the recommended daily energy expenditure is around 1500-1700 calories. Therefore, 1525 kcal/day is the closest option that meets this criteria.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A sedentary lifestyle implies minimal energy expenditure, so the daily caloric requirement should be relatively low, around 1250 kcal. This is the minimum amount needed to maintain basic bodily functions for an adult female with a healthy weight.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Broccoli has a high nutritional value in terms of vitamins, minerals, and fiber content, and it is also relatively low in calories compared to other options like cheese burgers. While apples are also nutritious, they have more sugar and thus higher calories per serving size. Bread can be cheap and nutritious if whole grain, but it's still more expensive than broccoli on a calorie-for-calorie basis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable and is often affordable, making it a good candidate for the cheapest and most nutritious option. Apples are also healthy but tend to be more expensive, especially if organic. Bread can vary in price and nutritional content depending on the type, and cheese burgers are generally considered an indulgent meal with a higher cost per calorie.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is often marketed as a dietary supplement and has a relatively high safe upper limit, which can be easily exceeded if taken in large doses. Excessive consumption of vitamin C is generally well-tolerated, but may lead to gastrointestinal discomfort and frequent urination.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and calcium absorption, so consuming more than the recommended amount should be beneficial. However, excessive vitamin D intake can lead to hypervitaminosis D, causing nausea, vomiting, and even kidney failure. Therefore, it is not advisable to consume vitamin D in excess.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced by certain types of fungi, and they typically grow in warm, moist environments. They can contaminate crops and cause serious health issues if consumed. Therefore, mycotoxins contaminate foods containing fungi formed during storage under moist conditions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Bacteria thrive in dry environments, and mycotoxins are harmful substances, so contaminated foods likely contain bacteria formed under dry conditions. Mycotoxins can be present in these bacterial cultures.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option B as it covers the most aspects of food security for women, including production, management, income generation, and nutrition. While the other options might be partial truths or specific roles, they don't encompass the full picture of a woman's contribution to food security.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditionally, men perform physically demanding tasks like ploughing and planting, while women engage in lighter activities like weeding. However, this dynamic is changing globally as gender roles evolve, and women are increasingly contributing to all aspects of food production and security. In many societies, women play a central role in food production, management, income generation, and ensuring household nutrition. This includes working with crops, livestock, and even taking on traditionally male-dominated tasks when necessary.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption in the small intestine. It plays a crucial role in the conversion of vitamin A into a form that can be used by the body to absorb calcium. Therefore, vitamin D is the key player in ensuring calcium absorption from the digestive tract.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including bone health, so it's likely involved in calcium absorption. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption, but it also has other important roles in immune function and bone health. Vitamin E is an antioxidant vitamin with no direct role in calcium absorption. Vitamin K is crucial for blood clotting and bone calcification but doesn't directly aid in calcium absorption from the small intestine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for the synthesis of methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then converted into TMP (thymidine monophosphate). This process is crucial for DNA synthesis and cell division, hence option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function, and neurotransmitters are essential for nerve signaling, so B12 must be involved in their synthesis. While it doesn't directly decarboxylate amino acids, it's necessary for the enzyme that does, which produces amine neurotransmitters.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. All three of these amino acids are considered essential because the body cannot produce them on its own and must be obtained from the diet. Leucine, methionine, and threonine are often referred to as the 'big three' essential amino acids, while proline, tyrosine, serine, valine, glycine, and arginine each have their own unique roles in the body and are also considered essential.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Valine and arginine are commonly found in protein-rich foods, and glycine is a simple amino acid, so they are likely essential components of the diet. Leucine, methionine, and threonine are also considered essential as they cannot be synthesized by the body.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements refer to the rights or privileges that one has access to, particularly in the context of social welfare and food security. Option C describes this concept accurately, as it refers to legislation that guarantees people the right to food, ensuring they have access to sufficient food sources.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements typically refer to social welfare programs, so the term likely relates to initiatives like Fair Price food shops that provide subsidized food. This choice aligns with the first option.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is associated with an increased amount of adipose tissue, or body fat, which requires more energy to maintain and therefore contributes to a higher basal metabolic rate. This is the key factor that sets apart obese individuals from their lean counterparts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen stores energy in the body, and obese individuals have more stored energy, so their higher BMR is likely due to increased glycogen levels. However, water also plays a significant role in metabolism and can influence BMR. While lean mass contributes less to overall BMR compared to fat mass and water content, it's still an important factor. Therefore, the correct answer is D: water.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures. While high bone mineral density would typically indicate stronger bones and lower fracture risk, osteoporosis specifically refers to low bone mineral density. High body weight can indeed put more strain on bones but it doesn't necessarily mean they're stronger. Lean mass is not directly related to bone strength. Poor muscle strength can make it harder for a person to perform daily tasks and may increase the risk of falling, leading to fractures, but it doesn't cause osteoporosis itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lean mass contributes to overall body weight, and higher body weight is generally associated with stronger bones, thus reducing fracture risk. High bone mineral density is a protective factor against osteoporosis and fractures. Poor muscle strength can lead to decreased balance and increased fall risk, which increases the likelihood of fractures. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The most direct method for measuring body composition is underwater weighing, as it involves measuring the weight of an individual while submerged in water, which takes into account both fat and non-fat mass.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The skinfold test directly measures subcutaneous fat, which is a key component of body composition, making it the most direct method. While BMI and weight can give an estimate, they are not as precise or direct as the skinfold test.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The definition of severe acute malnutrition in young children is a height-for-age Z score of less than 3, a weight-for-height Z score of less than 3, or the presence of oedema, regardless of age.\n",D,"Let's reason step by step. Severe acute malnutrition indicates significant undernourishment, so it must involve low weight-for-age, height-for-age, or edema. Option C covers all these indicators and is the most comprehensive description of severe acute malnutrition.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin, also known as vitamin B7, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It is involved in the decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters, which are essential for proper brain function.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin is a B vitamin, and some B vitamins like B6 are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, so biotin likely plays a similar role. However, the correct answer is D because it is the only option that directly mentions neurotransmitters.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question mentions that the HIV/AIDS campaigns have made significant progress, which implies a decrease in infection rates. Option A is thus the most appropriate choice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS campaigns have made progress globally, but specific data on European infection rates might not be readily available, making the current trend unknown. However, with campaigns, it is likely that if there was a significant increase, it would be reported widely.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids and isoflavonoids are indeed part of the flavonoid class, which is a group of plant compounds with various health benefits. While processing can affect the bioavailability of isoflavones in soy products, it doesn't change their digestibility. Beta-carotene and lycopene are carotenoids, not flavonoids, and they act as provitamin A. Carotenoids and flavonoids belong to different classes of polyphenols with distinct chemical structures and functions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both carotenoids and flavonoids contribute to the vibrant colors of fruits and vegetables, suggesting they belong to the same class of polyphenols. However, only 'Carotenoids' is an accurate description for this group as it specifically refers to a class of organic compounds that includes carotene and its derivatives, while flavonoids are a subset of the larger group of polyphenols.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cows' milk is a dairy product that typically contains significant amounts of lactose, a type of sugar. Honey is a natural sweetener but also contains sugars. Orange juice and agave nectar are both naturally sweet but can be unsweetened. Only option B, natural unsweetened orange juice, does not inherently contain free sugars.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Honey is a natural product and is often considered a healthier alternative to processed sugars, so it likely doesn't contain free sugars. Cows' milk can be high in sugar, but the question specifically asks about free sugars, which are added sugars, so cows' milk is a better fit for this category. Agave nectar is a type of sweetener and is often used as a sugar substitute, so it definitely contains free sugars. Unsweetened orange juice may contain some natural sugars from the fruit, but since it's unsweetened, it falls into the 'no added sugars' category.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a known risk factor for stomach cancer as it increases inflammation and can lead to chronic atrophic gastritis, which is a precursor to stomach cancer. Sugar, while not directly linked to stomach cancer, can contribute to obesity when consumed in excess. Salt and salt-preserved foods can also increase the risk of stomach cancer by promoting gastric acid secretion and inflammation. Dietary fiber, on the other hand, has cancer-fighting properties and is generally considered beneficial for overall health.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a risk factor for several health problems, including some cancers, so it's likely associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer as well. While sugar and salt can also be factors, obesity is a more significant contributor to the development of stomach cancer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. L-carnitine is a nutrient that supports cardiovascular health, and gut microbes can convert it into betaine, which has been linked to reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Trimethylamine is also produced from L-carnitine by these microbes and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, the correct answer is B and C.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The gut microbes metabolize L-carnitine into various compounds, and if one metabolite increases cardiovascular disease risk, the others likely do as well. Therefore, all three options are correct.",D
D,Let's reason step by step. Option C is the correct answer as there is clear evidence from various studies and research that shows a positive correlation between high calcium intake and lower bone fracture risk. This relationship has been well-established in medical literature.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Activated Vitamin D regulates calcium levels, so it might reduce calcium absorption to prevent excessive buildup in the body. Option B is false because there is no evidence for this claim; option C is false as well, as there is no clear link between high calcium intake and lower fracture risk; and option D is also false as absorption efficiency is not inversely proportional to calcium intake.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement is true because epidemiological studies have shown that early life experiences can impact health outcomes later in life, and these links cannot be fully explained by adult lifestyle factors alone. While the focus on maternal nutrition is important, it is a component of a broader understanding of how early life experiences shape health outcomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While early life experiences may play a role, the impact of adult lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, is likely more significant in determining long-term health outcomes. This is supported by epidemiological evidence from various populations, not just the UK. The statement accurately reflects this understanding.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. BED is an eating disorder characterized by emotional and behavioral symptoms. Antidepressants are primarily used to treat depression and anxiety disorders, while cognitive-behavioral therapy is a psychological treatment for various mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety. Benzodiazepines are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, but their use for BED is not well established. Antiobesity agents are only recommended as a last resort for weight management, specifically for individuals with obesity or overweight who have other health issues related to their weight.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Antidepressants, like Fluoxetine and Sertraline, are commonly used to treat mental health disorders, and since BED often involves emotional and psychological components, they would be effective in managing the condition. Benzodiazepines, such as Diazepam and Alprazolam, primarily target anxiety and panic disorders and do not specifically address the behavioral aspects of BED. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a well-known therapy for various mental health issues, its effectiveness in treating BED has not been conclusively proven in extensive clinical trials.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is essential for the synthesis of TMP (thymidine monophosphate), which is a building block of RNA and DNA. This vitamin also plays a role in the body's amino acid metabolism, helping to convert homocysteine into methionine, which is crucial for various physiological processes. While it is involved in neurotransmitter formation and the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, these are not direct functions of vitamin B6.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is crucial for amino acid metabolism, and since methionine is an amino acid synthesized from homocysteine, it's likely that B6 plays a role in this conversion process. So, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based sources of protein may lack some essential amino acids, but they don't necessarily lack all of them. While some plants are deficient in lysine and sulfur-containing amino acids, others provide these essential amino acids. Therefore, the statement that all plant protein sources are deficient in lysine is incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based proteins often lack certain essential amino acids, and sulfur-containing amino acids, like methionine and cysteine, are commonly deficient in plant sources. Lysine is also an essential amino acid that some plants may not provide enough of. Therefore, the correct statement is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urea is the main nitrogenous waste product in urine, formed from the breakdown of protein in the body. It is a neutral compound, unlike ammonia which is acidic and uric acid which is acidic.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is a waste product of protein breakdown, and since urine is a primary route for eliminating waste products, ammonia would be the main nitrogenous compound found in urine. ",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a daily intake of free sugars to be less than 10% of total energy intake for adults and children over 10 years old, which is equivalent to less than 5% of total energy consumption. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The WHO aims to promote healthy dietary habits, and excessive sugar intake is linked to various health issues. Therefore, their recommendation would likely set a very low limit, such as less than 5%, for daily free sugar consumption. This choice is the only one that aligns with the WHO's focus on public health and preventive measures.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Bulimia Nervosa, or bulimia, is characterized by cycles of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting to prevent weight gain. While both genders can be affected, it is more common in females and those who experience this disorder often have a lower BMI due to the excessive loss of nutrients through vomiting. Some patients may engage in purging without binge eating episodes, but the primary feature is the cycle of binge and purge behavior.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eating disorders stem from a complex interplay of factors, including societal pressures and body image issues, which affect individuals of all genders. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect a similar prevalence of Bulimia Nervosa in both men and women. While BMI is often used as a metric for eating disorders, it's not the only indicator, and some patients may exhibit other behaviors like purging without binge eating episodes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, as it increases insulin resistance and disrupts glucose metabolism. Additionally, obesity is also associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly cancers related to the colon, postmenopausal breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. Furthermore, obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as it contributes to high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and stroke, due to its effects on blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and inflammation. Additionally, obesity is also strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, especially endometrial, breast, and colon cancers.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing in East Asians is often attributed to a deficiency of ALDH2, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in breaking down alcohol and certain drugs. This enzyme deficiency results in a slower metabolism of alcohol, leading to higher levels of acetaldehyde, which can cause facial flushing as a side effect. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'ALDH2'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing is related to alcohol metabolism, and aldehyde dehydrogenases are enzymes involved in this process. So, a deficiency in ALDH4, which is involved in aldehyde metabolism, could explain the flushing response. This enzyme is particularly important for metabolizing alcohol, so it makes sense that its deficiency would lead to an increased risk of facial flushing when consuming alcohol.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in immune function and acts as an antioxidant. It helps protect cells from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. While all the vitamins mentioned are essential, only vitamin C is specifically known for its strong antioxidant properties and its role in immune health.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is known to have numerous health benefits and plays a role in various bodily functions. Given its importance in maintaining overall health, it's likely that it also acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. While all the vitamins mentioned are essential, only vitamin D specifically stands out as a lipid-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The oral phase of digestion involves mechanical breakdown of food, but it is primarily the stomach and small intestine that are responsible for chemical digestion, with enzymes breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, respectively. So, statement D is incorrect as it describes an enzyme action specific to the small intestine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Chewing and swallowing involve muscular activity, which requires energy. Considering the effort involved in these actions, it's plausible that a significant portion, around 2%, of the energy content of food is expended during the oral phase of digestion. The statement suggesting that only 2% of the energy content of food is expended during this process is incorrect.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The recommended daily protein intake for athletes is between 0.8 and 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, with some variation depending on the individual's activity level and goals. This range ensures that the body gets enough protein to support muscle repair and growth without overdoing it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Athletes engage in intense physical activity and require more protein than sedentary individuals to build and repair muscle tissues. Therefore, their daily protein intake should exceed 2.0 g per kg of body weight to meet their increased needs. This ensures optimal muscle recovery and growth.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The BMI formula is weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared. For a height of 1.75 meters and a weight of 99 kilograms, the calculation is 99 kg / (1.75 m)^2 = 39.6, which falls in the 'Obesity' category on the BMI chart. Therefore, the patient's BMI indicates obesity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. For this patient, that would be 99 kg / (1.75 m)^2, which is approximately 29.84. Since the answer choices are in increasing order, the nearest value to this calculation is 30, so we choose option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Homocysteine is an amino acid that, when present in high levels in the blood, can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Vitamins B9 (folate), B6, and B12 are essential for metabolizing homocysteine and maintaining healthy levels. Vitamin D also plays a role in overall cardiovascular health.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Given its involvement in metabolic processes, it's possible that it also plays a role in lowering homocysteine levels. However, the most direct answer is provided by folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12, which are collectively known as the B-vitamins. These vitamins work together to lower homocysteine levels through their involvement in amino acid metabolism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. After a night of fasting, the body breaks down fat stores for energy, producing ketones and free fatty acids. These are then converted to ketone bodies. Breakfast, especially one that includes protein and carbohydrates like toast and eggs, increases blood glucose levels. So, after breakfast, there will be more glucose than before, increasing its concentration in the blood.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ketone bodies are produced when the body utilizes fat for energy, which typically occurs during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake. However, after consuming a meal with carbohydrates, the body will prioritize glucose as an energy source, leading to an increase in ketone body production. Therefore, after breakfast, ketone bodies will be at a higher concentration compared to before breakfast.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are often associated with low nutrient intake, which is typically due to economic factors such as low income. While age can impact nutrient requirements, it is not the primary factor driving deficiencies in high-income countries, especially when other factors like access to food are considered.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Intrinsic factor is essential for nutrient absorption in the stomach. As people age, the production of intrinsic factor declines, which can lead to deficiencies in various vitamins and minerals. This is a unique factor that sets it apart from the others, as income and mobility are not directly related to nutrient absorption, and tissue turnover typically doesn't change drastically with age.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that early exposure to certain microbes is crucial for developing a healthy immune system, and a lack of such exposure can lead to an increased risk of allergies. While living on a farm may expose children to more microbes, it is not necessarily a guarantee of reducing the development of atopic diseases. Antiseptic swipes and careful breastfeeding practices are not directly related to the hygiene hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that early exposure to microbes is crucial for developing a healthy immune system. Therefore, for high-risk infants, it's important to maintain strict hygiene during breastfeeding to minimize exposure to potential allergens. This helps in reducing the development of atopic diseases.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology focuses on understanding how nutritional factors influence the development and progression of diseases in populations. It also examines the impact of dietary patterns and specific nutrients on health outcomes, which aligns with both options provided.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. China has undergone a rapid shift from a predominantly rice-based diet to one that includes more meat, dairy, and processed foods, similar to the Western diet. This transition has been driven by economic growth and changing lifestyles, resulting in an increase in obesity and diet-related diseases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sweden is known for its emphasis on health and well-being, with progressive policies promoting healthy lifestyles and sustainable food systems. This suggests that Sweden has likely experienced a rapid nutrition transition in recent decades. On the other hand, China, India, and Britain have undergone significant economic transformations, but their nutrition transitions may not have been as swift or uniform across the population.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The pancreas secretes enzymes that aid in digestion, including pepsinogen, amylase, and trypsinogen. Pepsinogen needs to be activated before it can digest proteins, which is done by the removal of a peptide sequence. Enteropeptidase is an enzyme that cleaves this blocking peptide, activating trypsinogen into trypsin, which then digests proteins. Therefore, enteropeptidase is crucial for the activation process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pancreatic α-amylase is a key enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion. It breaks down complex starches into simpler sugars, ultimately leading to the production of free glucose molecules. This process occurs in the small intestine, specifically in the duodenum, where the environment is basic due to the presence of bile salts and pancreatic enzymes. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A macrobient diet is typically high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, which are all rich in fiber. While a vegan diet may be low in fat due to the exclusion of animal products, it can still contain healthy fats like avocados, nuts, and seeds. Sugar and energy density can vary depending on the specific foods chosen within these diets but are not inherent characteristics.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Macrobiotic and vegan diets are typically low in processed foods and refined sugars, which are major contributors to energy density. While they may be high or low in fat depending on the specific diet and individual choices, both types of diets generally emphasize whole, unprocessed foods that are rich in fiber and nutrients. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that they are high in fiber and low in processed food items.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Type IIb muscle fibres are intermediate between type IIa and type I, having some characteristics of both. They have a moderate oxidative capacity, higher than type I but lower than type IIa, which would not be considered low. They also have good fatigue resistance, but not exceptional like type IIa. They are typically found in areas with fast twitch muscles that need to be able to contract quickly, so they do have fast contractile speed. So, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Type IIb muscle fibers are known for their rapid and powerful contractions, suggesting a high motor unit strength to generate those forceful movements. They are also known as fast-twitch fibers, indicating a high contractile speed. However, they have a lower oxidative capacity compared to other fiber types, as they primarily serve for short bursts of activity.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A specific biochemical status index for a micronutrient like vitamin C is most useful to assess the presence or risk of a deficiency, as it directly indicates the body's need for that particular nutrient.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A balanced micronutrient status is crucial for various physiological functions, contributing significantly to overall health and disease prevention. While all options are valid, the measurement of a specific biochemical status index is most useful for assessing the presence or risk of a deficiency, as it directly indicates the body's need for that particular nutrient.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a known risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer as it increases the production of estrogen, which can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Red meat and dietary fat do not directly increase the risk, while fish consumption may even offer protection due to its high content of certain nutrients.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Red meat is often high in saturated fats and heme iron, both of which have been linked to increased inflammation and oxidative stress, potentially promoting cancer development. While fish has been associated with reduced risk due to its anti-inflammatory properties, the other options are not known to significantly impact breast cancer risk.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose toxicity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation are all factors that contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Glucose toxicity can damage neurons, while insulin insensitivity and inflammation can lead to a range of cognitive issues as people age.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin resistance can impair glucose uptake in the brain, leading to energy deficits and neuronal dysfunction, which directly contribute to cognitive decline. Systemic inflammation is a risk factor for insulin resistance and can also directly impact cognitive function through various inflammatory pathways. Glucose neurotoxicity refers to the toxic effects of high glucose levels on neurons, which can lead to cognitive impairment.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Protein synthesis is regulated by a balance of hormones like glucagon and insulin, as well as amino acids. Glucagon promotes protein breakdown, while insulin stimulates protein synthesis. Lysine is an essential amino acid that can stimulate protein synthesis directly. Therefore, increased availability of lysine in the fed state would lead to enhanced protein synthesis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is released during stress to mobilize energy resources, which includes promoting protein synthesis to repair and rebuild tissues. Insulin and glucagon are hormones that regulate blood sugar levels, with insulin promoting tissue growth and glucose uptake, while glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen for glucose release when blood sugar falls. Lysine is an amino acid involved in protein synthesis but does not directly influence the rate of protein synthesis on its own. Therefore, only option D correctly describes a factor that can increase protein synthesis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Histones are proteins that play a crucial role in the structure and function of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and protein that makes up chromosomes. They are essential for gene regulation and expression, and they help package DNA into a compact form that can be stored and accessed efficiently within the cell nucleus.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Histones are integral components of chromatin structure, directly interacting with DNA strands and influencing gene expression, similar to how nucleotides function in genetic coding. Therefore, histones are essential for the structural organization and regulation of genes within the cell nucleus.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. High glycaemic index carbohydrates can cause blood sugar spikes, leading to increased inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, potentially accelerating cognitive decline. An imbalanced n-6 to n-3 fat ratio has been linked to cognitive issues due to its impact on brain cell membrane structure and inflammation. Long-chain saturated fats can also contribute to inflammation and oxidative stress, further exacerbating cognitive decline. Thus, all three options could be considered contributors to accelerated cognitive decline.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Long-chain saturated fats can impair blood flow and promote inflammation in the brain, negatively impacting cognitive processes and increasing the risk of dementia. High glycaemic index carbohydrates can also contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance, further exacerbating cognitive decline. While a high n-6:n-3 fat ratio may have some impact, it is generally considered less significant compared to the other two factors in the context of cognitive decline.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that can stimulate cell growth and division, and its increased levels are associated with an elevated risk of prostate cancer. While dietary fat and alcohol consumption can certainly impact overall health and potentially increase the risk for certain cancers, they are not specifically linked to prostate cancer in the same way as IGF-1.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The breakdown of glucose through glycolysis generates a net gain of 2 ATP molecules, contributing to the overall energy production from glucose metabolism. The complete oxidation of glucose results in a yield of 38 ATP molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is B, which represents the highest yield.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is crucial for preventing neural tube defects in infants. While it primarily affects the development of the baby's brain and spinal cord, it can also impact gene methylation. Imprinted genes like IGF2 are important for growth and development, and their methylation patterns are established early in life. Therefore, folic acid supplementation can influence the methylation state of IGF2, potentially affecting its expression and function in the child later in life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid plays a crucial role in hormonal balance, and sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone can influence gene expression, including methylation patterns. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that folic acid supplementation during pregnancy could impact the methylation of genes involved in hormonal balance, such as IGF2. This could lead to either increased or decreased methylation depending on the specific mechanisms at play.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, and its absorption requires intrinsic factor (IF). With aging, the stomach can become atrophic, reducing IF secretion, and H. pylori infection can lead to an inflammatory environment that hinders vitamin B12 absorption. Both factors can contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Atrophic gastritis, characterized by inflammation and thinning of the stomach lining, directly impairs the absorption of vitamin B12, leading to deficiency. While *H. pylori* infection can also cause this condition, it is not always present in cases of atrophic gastritis. Reduced secretion of intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption, is another key factor in older adults as their stomachs produce less of it with age.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The protein:energy ratio is a measure of how much protein an organism requires in relation to its energy needs. Infants and children are growing rapidly, so they require more energy-dense foods for overall growth and development. Young adults are in a period of rapid muscle growth and repair, so they also benefit from a higher protein:energy ratio. The elderly have unique nutritional needs due to age-related changes in metabolism and muscle mass loss, but this does not necessarily mean they need the most protein-dense food. Children are generally more susceptible to the negative effects of protein deficiency, as their growth and development depend on adequate protein intake.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Young adults typically engage in activities that require more muscle mass and energy expenditure, hence their higher need for protein-dense food. This makes option C the correct answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination is a reversible process that involves the transfer of an amino group, and it occurs in both catabolism and anabolism. Only non-essential amino acids undergo transamination during catabolism to produce energy. While essential amino acids are used in anabolism to build proteins. So, option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for various metabolic processes, including enzyme activity, and its deficiency can lead to impaired amino acid metabolism. Transamination is a reversible process that involves the transfer of an amino group, and it plays a crucial role in amino acid synthesis and breakdown. Option C is thus correct as transaminases require coenzymes derived from vitamin B12 for their function.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Engel's law states that as income increases, the share of income spent on food decreases. This is because people tend to shift their spending towards non-food items as their disposable income increases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As income increases, people have more disposable income to allocate to various goods and services, including a greater variety and quantity of food. This leads to an increase in the proportion of income spent on food, which is option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin resistance is a condition where the body fails to respond properly to leptin, a hormone that regulates energy balance and appetite. Option C describes this situation accurately: high concentrations of leptin in the bloodstream without a corresponding reduction in energy intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin resistance implies a failure of adipose tissue to adequately release leptin, a hormone that signals satiety and regulates energy balance. This leads to overeating and weight gain, as the body doesn't respond to leptin's signaling.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Long-chain fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, are essential for brain development and have been shown to improve cognitive function and visual performance in infants. Therefore, supplementation during pregnancy and infancy is likely to benefit visual performance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. EPA and DHA are crucial components of brain cell membranes and play a vital role in neuronal communication and signal transduction, which are essential for motor function. Additionally, they support the development and health of the retina, which is responsible for visual perception. Therefore, it is safe to say that supplementation during these critical developmental stages will likely benefit both motor performance and visual performance.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is transported in the circulation by binding to proteins like transferrin or ferritin, ensuring its safe and efficient delivery to cells with high metabolic demands.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron exists in its ferrous (Fe2+) form in the blood and readily dissolves in serum, allowing for efficient transport to tissues. However, it primarily binds to transferrin, a protein carrier, for delivery to cells. This complex is then taken up by cells via endocytosis and released into the cytoplasm, where it's used for various functions like DNA synthesis and energy production.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone that regulates metabolism, particularly the utilization of glucose and fatty acids. Insulin deficiency leads to reduced insulin signaling, which results in decreased glucose uptake by cells, causing an increase in blood glucose levels. This, in turn, stimulates lipolysis (fat breakdown) to provide more available glucose for energy. Therefore, reduced lipolysis is a consequence of insulin deficiency.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes energy storage, including the uptake and storage of glucose and fatty acids, thus reducing the need for lipolysis. Insulin also stimulates protein synthesis, so it would be counterproductive to reduce proteolysis. Ketogenesis occurs when the body shifts to using fat as a primary energy source due to insufficient insulin, which is not directly associated with insulin deficiency. Therefore, reduced gluconeogenesis is the most likely consequence of insulin deficiency, as the body tries to compensate for the lack of insulin by producing more glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Agricultural research can be a tool for reducing hunger and poverty by improving crop yields, developing sustainable practices, and providing access to essential resources for farmers, especially those in developing regions. This can lead to increased food production and improved livelihoods for small-scale farmers, who often face challenges due to limited access to resources and market networks. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Organic farming methods, which emphasize natural processes and avoid synthetic inputs, are crucial for promoting sustainable agriculture and improving livelihoods in impoverished communities. However, organic farming may not always be the primary focus of agricultural research aimed at reducing hunger and poverty. The correct answer is C, as it highlights that research focused on poor farmers and consumers is a public good with limited profit potential but significant social benefits, requiring public investment.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, plays a crucial role in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and is essential for the production of red blood cells. It acts as a cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is then used in the synthesis of cysteine, a precursor to glutathione, an antioxidant molecule that helps reduce oxidative stress on the body's systems. Therefore, folic acid is the vitamin that provides the coenzyme for reduction reactions in fatty acid synthesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin, in its coenzyme forms, participates in various metabolic reactions, including those involving electron transfer, which are essential for fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, riboflavin is the vitamin that provides the coenzyme for reduction reactions in fatty acid synthesis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is a storage form of glucose, and its synthesis requires UDP-glucose as an intermediate. While the breakdown of glycogen releases glucose, glucagon stimulates its synthesis. In muscle cells, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, which can then be used for energy or converted back into glycogen. The correct statement is option A, highlighting the importance of UDP-glucose in the process.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen, the storage form of glucose, is primarily found in the liver and brain, tissues with high energy requirements and the need for readily available glucose. While the statement about glucagon increasing glycogen synthesis is true, it is a hormone that stimulates glucose breakdown, not synthesis. The correct statement is B, as muscle breaks down glycogen to release glucose during fasting.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. All dietary proteins do not have the same amino acid content and composition; this is because different sources of protein provide varying amounts and types of amino acids, which are essential for human body functions. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In adults maintaining nitrogen balance, the amino acids released from protein breakdown can be efficiently reused for new protein synthesis, minimizing the need for additional dietary protein. This option accurately describes this equilibrium state and its implications for protein nutrition.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The answer is D, as ABCG5/G8 is a cholesterol-binding protein that acts as a cholesterol transporter and plays a role in excreting cholesterol from the body, whereas NPC1L1, LDL receptor, and ACAT2 are all involved in cholesterol absorption.",D,"Let's reason step by step. ACAT2 plays a crucial role in cholesterol absorption by facilitating the formation of cholesterol esters, which are more easily transported across the intestinal lining. NPC1L1 and ABCG5/G8, on the other hand, are both involved in regulating cholesterol uptake and transport, with ABCG5/G8 specifically playing a key role in inhibiting cholesterol absorption.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Risk assessment is a process used to evaluate the potential health risks associated with exposure to various substances. It involves analyzing data on toxicity and human exposure to determine the likelihood of adverse effects. By doing so, it supports decision-making in risk management, including setting allowable limits or guidelines for safe exposure levels.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Risk assessment provides the scientific basis for risk management decisions regarding food substances, ensuring their safety for human consumption. It also estimates the likelihood of adverse effects on humans from exposure to toxic substances and helps derive allowable limits or guidelines.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fats are composed mainly of triacylglycerols, which is their primary function. The range given in the question is a common and typical range for fats, indicating that the correct answer is B: 50-75%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fats contain a mixture of lipids, including triacylglycerols, phospholipids, and cholesterol, with triacylglycerols typically constituting around 50-75% of the total fat content. This range is considered normal, so an answer indicating more than this (i.e., >95%) would be unexpected.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hemoglobin A1c is a test that measures the average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months, making it the most suitable choice for assessing long-term glucose control.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures the body's ability to handle a glucose load, providing insights into blood sugar regulation over a period of several hours. It is used to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cow's milk allergy is a common food allergy in infants and children, and it can lead to various symptoms such as atopic dermatitis (skin inflammation) and enterocolitis (inflammation of the small intestine). Diarrhea is also a common symptom in children with cow's milk intolerance, which is often associated with an inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in cow's milk.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Severe atopic dermatitis, characterized by itchy and inflamed skin, is a common manifestation of allergic reactions, including those triggered by food allergens. Enterocolitis refers to inflammation of the small and/or large intestine, which can also be a symptom of food allergies. Diarrhea is a frequent gastrointestinal symptom associated with food intolerances and allergies, often indicating an inflammatory response in the digestive tract.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pregnancy and lactation are known to decrease calcium requirements as the body prioritizes calcium for bone growth and milk production. This leaves less calcium available for other bodily functions, which can lead to a negative calcium balance. Additionally, the increased demand for calcium during these periods can cause the body to temporarily lose mineral density in the bones, but this is a temporary effect that is reversed once calcium requirements return to normal post-pregnancy and lactation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy and lactation, the body prioritizes calcium supply to the developing fetus and infant, leading to a decrease in calcium requirements for the mother. This can result in temporary bone mineral loss, as the body reallocates calcium for other purposes. However, this is a short-term process, and while it may affect bone mineral content later in life if not managed properly, it does not directly decrease the rate of dietary calcium absorption.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is typically measured while an individual is at rest in a comfortable sitting position, and it represents the minimum energy required for vital body functions. While weight gain can increase BMR due to an increase in fat-free mass, weight loss would result in a decrease in overall body mass, including fat-free mass, thus decreasing BMR. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can impact metabolic rate but are not mentioned specifically as factors influencing BMR in the question.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) reflects the body's energy expenditure at rest and is tightly regulated by thyroid hormones, ensuring metabolic stability. While BMR is typically measured while sitting comfortably, it is primarily influenced by factors like age, gender, weight, and height, with a slight variation in position. In hypothyroidism, the rate remains unchanged, indicating that thyroid hormones do not directly impact BMR. Conversely, hyperthyroidism can lead to an increased BMR as the body requires more energy for metabolic processes. However, weight gain does not directly influence BMR; rather, it affects fat-free mass, which can impact overall energy expenditure. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid produced during fibre fermentation in the colon, has been found to have anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting properties. It stimulates the expression of genes that protect against cancer development, providing a plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against colon cancer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The silencing of the SLC5A8 tumor suppressor gene would likely prevent the expression of proteins that promote tumor growth, thus offering a protective effect against colon cancer. Butyric acid, one of the short-chain fatty acids produced during fibre fermentation, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, suggesting it could be a key player in this process.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The relationship between dietary cholesterol intake and plasma LDL cholesterol levels is complex due to the involvement of multiple regulatory mechanisms, including absorption, lipoprotein export, and hepatic clearance. Each of these processes can be influenced by various factors, making it challenging to establish a straightforward cause-and-effect relationship in humans.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol levels by adjusting its uptake and processing of cholesterol in response to varying dietary intake. This intricate regulatory system can lead to complex interactions and variations in how cholesterol is absorbed, exported, and cleared, making it challenging to establish a straightforward relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Thus, the answer lies in the complexity of these regulatory mechanisms.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Iron deficiency is often accompanied by low hemoglobin levels due to reduced iron availability for red blood cell production. In infection, the body produces more hepcidin, a protein that regulates iron metabolism and can lead to lower ferritin levels. Thus, option A is the most likely combination: low hemoglobin, high ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, and high hepcidin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In iron deficiency with severe infection, we would expect low hemoglobin due to reduced red blood cell production, low ferritin as iron stores are depleted, high serum transferrin receptors indicating increased iron demand, and low hepcidin to enhance iron absorption. Option A is the correct combination.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. The recommended limit for saturated fat intake for people with diabetes is typically set at 7% of total daily energy intake to help manage blood sugar levels and reduce cardiovascular risk. This recommendation is based on clinical evidence and guidelines from organizations like the American Diabetes Association.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats should be limited in a diabetic diet, but a moderate intake of around 15% of total daily energy is still acceptable to ensure sufficient energy intake and prevent excessive carbohydrate consumption. This allows for the maintenance of blood glucose levels while also providing essential fatty acids for cellular functions.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets were not recommended previously due to a lack of weight loss effectiveness when compared to other dietary approaches. The lack of adherence to this diet style was also a factor, as it required significant changes in eating habits and food choices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets can be challenging to maintain due to their restrictive nature and the abundance of high-carbohydrate foods in typical diets, leading to low adherence and inconsistent results. Additionally, early research suggested a link between high protein intake and increased cardiovascular risk, which was a concern for health professionals. However, more recent studies have refuted these claims, and low-carbohydrate diets are now recognized as an effective strategy for weight loss and improving metabolic health.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactose intolerance is a condition where individuals lack sufficient lactase, an enzyme needed to break down lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. While some people may have a low tolerance for lactose, it doesn't necessarily mean they are intolerant; only that their body can't process it as efficiently. Therefore, the statement that 'lactose intolerance is present in up to 20% of the population' is the most accurate description.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactose intolerance is a widespread issue, affecting a significant portion of the population, which explains why it is excluded from a low FODMAP diet. While lactose intolerance can be managed through various means, including enzyme supplements, it does not necessarily mean that everyone experiences the same level of discomfort or that it is always the cause of milk intolerance.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) have an increased susceptibility to infections due to a lack of functioning immune system. Recurrent severe infections are a tell-tale sign, and a family history of unexplained infant death could also indicate a genetic predisposition for SCID. While the BCG vaccination is not typically given to infants, it can cause a generalised spread of the vaccine strain in some cases, but this is not indicative of a functioning immune system.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The most suggestive sign of severe combined immunodeficiency is the occurrence of recurrent and severe infections, as the immune system is unable to effectively fight off pathogens. This can lead to frequent and life-threatening infections that a healthy immune system would typically ward off. Additionally, a family history of unexplained infant death could also be a factor, indicating a genetic predisposition for immunodeficiency. While BCG vaccination can cause generalised spread in some cases, it is not as indicative of a severe combined immunodeficiency on its own.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training is known to increase the body's ability to utilize fat as a fuel source during exercise, leading to reduced muscle glycogen usage and decreased muscle glycogen content. This is because endurance training increases the capacity of the muscles to break down and use fats for energy, which reduces the reliance on glycogen stores. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training enhances the body's ability to utilize stored carbohydrates, leading to increased muscle glycogen use during exercise to sustain prolonged activity. Additionally, it also increases the efficiency of using fatty acids as fuel, reducing the reliance on muscle glycogen stores.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber, also known as roughage, is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be fully digested by the body. It passes through the digestive system relatively unchanged and helps to add bulk to stool, promoting regular bowel movements. The fermentation of dietary fiber by gut bacteria produces short-chain fatty acids, which have various beneficial effects on colon health. Among the options, only statement C accurately describes the process of fiber fermentation and its impact on the colon.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fiber is efficiently fermented by gut bacteria, with both soluble and insoluble forms being completely broken down within 24 hours, leading to the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids have a positive impact on colon health, providing energy and promoting a healthy environment for gut bacteria. Therefore, the correct statement is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Confounding variables can affect the validity of a study if they are not properly controlled or accounted for. In nutritional epidemiology, confounding is challenging because dietary habits can change over time, making it hard to isolate specific associations. Additionally, accurately measuring and recording diets in large studies is a complex task, which further contributes to the challenge.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology faces a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of dietary habits, as people tend to change their diets over time, making it difficult to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships. Accurate measurement of diet is also challenging in large studies, and confounding variables are common as different dietary components often correlate with each other.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Intracellular fat metabolism involves the uptake of non-esterified fatty acids into cells, which can occur through diffusion or carrier-mediated transport. The correct statement is option B as it accurately describes this process involving fatty acid binding proteins, translocase, and transport proteins.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Non-esterified fatty acids enter cells through a combination of diffusion and carrier-mediated transport, where specific proteins facilitate the esterification, synthesis, and transport of fatty acids across the cell membrane. This process is crucial for energy production and cellular functions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Overweight and obesity are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. While breast cancer can be a concern, it is not as directly linked to overweight/obesity as the other conditions mentioned.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The main health concern associated with overweight and obesity is the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes due to impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. While cardiovascular disease and breast cancer can also be linked to obesity, they are not directly caused by it in the same way as type 2 diabetes.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been found beneficial in treating bulimia nervosa by regulating mood and reducing the urge to binge eat and purge. While body image discussion is important, it is not sufficient as a standalone approach. Discussing weight with patients can be counterproductive and should be avoided, especially when not combined with other treatments. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In treating bulimia nervosa, it's crucial to avoid focusing on weight, as this can exacerbate body image issues and trigger unhealthy behaviors. Instead, the emphasis should be on addressing the underlying psychological factors and purging practices. Fluoxetine is a commonly used medication that has shown benefits in managing bulimia, specifically targeting mood and appetite regulation.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. During short-term intense activity, the body primarily relies on rapid energy release for muscle contraction. Muscle glycogen is the main source of quick energy, providing fuel for muscles to contract during sprinting or other short bursts of activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During short bursts of intense activity like sprinting, muscles rely heavily on readily available energy sources, such as stored triacylglycerol, to fuel rapid contractions. While all options are energy sources, only muscle triacylglycerol provides the main fuel for these short-term activities.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a simple and widely used method to estimate body composition changes, but it has limitations in accurately measuring body fat percentage, especially for individuals with larger muscle mass. DXA is a more advanced and accurate method that directly measures body fat mass and water content. The four-compartment model is a mathematical equation that estimates body composition, but it requires multiple measurements and is not as widely used or accessible as DXA. MRI provides the most detailed image of body composition but is costly and not commonly used for monitoring weight loss.",B,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used and accessible tool for assessing body fat changes, providing a good indication of overall weight status and its relationship to height. However, it does not differentiate between lean and fat mass. DXA and four-compartment models are more advanced and provide a more accurate assessment of body composition, including fat distribution and percentage body fat. MRI also offers high accuracy but is less accessible and costly.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. While all the options are commonly associated with an increased risk of eating disorders, perfectionism traits are not directly linked to the development of eating disorders in a causal manner. It is more of a personality trait that can be present or absent and does not necessarily lead to disordered eating behaviors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Perfectionistic tendencies, characterized by high standards and a focus on flawlessness, can actually serve as a protective factor against developing eating disorders by promoting self-discipline and healthy habits. The gender of the individual is also not a direct risk factor, as eating disorders affect both males and females, although they manifest differently. Dieting during adolescence, however, is a well-known risk factor as it often leads to disordered eating behaviors.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2020, it was estimated that around half of all adults worldwide consume iodine below the recommended daily intake (RNI).

D,"Let's reason step by step. Epigenetic changes can indeed be key to understanding how early life experiences impact later health outcomes. All three options are true: A, B, and C. DNA methylation is a type of epigenetic change that can modify gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself (B). These modifications can then influence which genes are turned on or off, leading to different phenotypes (C). This is particularly important because one genotype can result in multiple phenotypes due to these epigenetic changes (C).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Epigenetic changes primarily involve modifications to DNA methylation patterns, where the addition or removal of methyl groups alters gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. This process can indeed lead to different phenotypes from a single genotype, as it affects how genes are expressed and regulated. Therefore, both B and C are correct.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Acute binge drinking can lead to a condition known as 'Holiday Heart Syndrome', which is characterized by an abnormal heart rhythm and is often associated with excessive alcohol consumption during holidays or special occasions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The association between acute binge drinking and heart rhythm disturbances is often referred to as ""Beach heart syndrome"" due to its prevalence in coastal areas where alcohol consumption tends to be higher. This syndrome is characterized by temporary changes in heart rhythm, not a permanent condition like the other options.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Risk management strategies for chemical contaminants in food aim to ensure safety while allowing for reasonable consumption. Option D describes a strategy that balances these goals by prohibiting the introduction of contaminated food above a specified level, which is a common and effective approach.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Risk management for chemical contaminants in food typically involves collaboration with manufacturers to establish achievable levels of contamination while ensuring that these levels remain within safe limits for consumers. This approach is reflected in the answer choice D, which prohibits the introduction of contaminated food above a specified level (a risk-based MRL or tolerance).",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Malnutrition in older adults is often associated with a decline in overall health and immune function, leading to an increased risk of infections and a higher mortality rate. Additionally, malnutrition can contribute to physical debility and a slower recovery time from illnesses or surgeries, resulting in longer hospital stays.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The other options are negative outcomes of malnutrition, but they are not directly associated with the cause.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the question, we are looking at food consumption patterns in Wales and Scotland as of 2020. In both countries, meat is a staple, with Wales having a higher consumption rate than Scotland. While potatoes are a staple in Welsh cuisine, they are consumed in lower quantities in Scotland. Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet and are likely to be consumed in similar quantities across the UK. As for confectionery, it is often seen as a treat and may be consumed in higher quantities in Scotland due to its association with Scottish traditions like 'tartan day'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wales and Scotland are known for their traditional dishes that often feature meat, so it's likely they consume more of it compared to other regions. Potatoes are a staple food in the UK, especially in Scotland, but 'lower quantities' suggests less than other regions, which is true of fruits and veggies. While confectionery may be consumed in smaller amounts in Wales due to its high sugar content, meat is the most likely answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle tissue is more conductive than adipose (fat) tissue due to the higher water content in muscle cells, which allows for faster current flow.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle is denser and heavier than fat, which means it provides a more efficient pathway for the electrical current to travel through. This results in faster conduction of electricity through muscle tissue compared to adipose tissue (fat).",B

Riboflavin and thiamin have distinct roles in energy production and the function of the nervous system, respectively.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the body, so a deficiency would lead to an increased time for blood to clot. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K plays a role in bone health and calcium regulation, so a deficiency might lead to increased calcitonin production to compensate for low calcium levels. This would result in higher calcitonin levels in the plasma.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for establishing cause-and-effect relationships between variables, as they randomly assign participants to treatment and control groups, eliminating potential confounding factors. In this case, randomized controlled studies would provide the best evidence for the association between sugar consumption and dental caries risk.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Non-randomized controlled trials allow researchers to observe the effects of sugar intake on dental caries over an extended period, making them ideal for this type of study. This type of design provides strong evidence for the association between sugar consumption and dental caries risk.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Alcoholic myopathy is a condition that affects the muscles of alcoholics, and its prevalence varies. The range given in option C is the most common, indicating that it falls between 20% and 40%, which is the most likely answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcoholic myopathy often goes unnoticed in its early stages, so the actual prevalence is likely much lower than the reported figures. However, considering the global prevalence of alcohol use disorder, we can assume that a significant portion of those individuals develop this condition to some extent.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The World Food Summit set a target to halve hunger by 2015, which was not achieved globally as the number of food-insecure people decreased but did not reach the goal. While there is no clear data on the exact number of food-insecure people before and after the summit, it can be inferred that the number slightly decreased but did not meet the ambitious target set by the summit.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With population growth and increasing food demand, it's logical to assume that the number of food-insecure people has been steadily increasing since the summit. However, there might have been efforts to reduce hunger globally, but the scale of the problem is vast, and it's unlikely that a significant portion of hungry people were addressed.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiologists examine multiple factors when establishing potential causes of health outcomes, including the strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome, temporal relationships (B), and whether reducing the exposure decreases the risk of the outcome (C). All three options are considered to establish a causal link.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important factor in establishing causality is the strength of the association between exposure and outcome, as a strong correlation indicates a likely causal relationship. Evidence of temporal relation (B) and reversibility (C) are also crucial, but they are more supportive rather than essential for establishing causation. Thus, option A is the most important factor.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin suppresses hunger, while ghrelin stimulates appetite. Ghrelin and leptin are the hormones that act on the hypothalamus to increase hunger and satiety, respectively.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin and ghrelin both play roles in energy regulation, with insulin promoting satiety and ghrelin stimulating hunger. This is the reverse of what is listed in the choices.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is a vitamin that plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, specifically in the synthesis of amino acids and the production of DNA. It is involved in the synthesis of TMP (thymidine monophosphate), which is used in DNA replication and cell division. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is essential for one-carbon metabolism, which includes the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This process is crucial for DNA synthesis and the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Therefore, folate plays a vital role in these processes.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. All three options are true as they accurately describe why adequate nutrition before conception is crucial for a successful pregnancy. The embryonic period can be vulnerable to external factors, and it may occur before a woman knows she is pregnant, making early intervention important. Additionally, interventions in late pregnancy might not be effective due to potential challenges that have already arisen from inadequate nutrition during the pre-conception period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The embryonic period is crucial because it's when the fetus is most susceptible to external factors, making adequate nutrition during this time essential. Additionally, interventions in late pregnancy may not be effective as the foetus may already be affected by nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, addressing nutritional needs before conception is vital for a successful pregnancy.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies have found a negative correlation between fruit and vegetable intake and bone mineral loss, but this could be due to other lifestyle factors like exercise and smoking that are often associated with healthy eating habits. Supplementation studies suggest that these foods may actually help prevent bone loss, indicating a positive relationship with skeletal health. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that fruit and vegetable consumption has an uncertain relationship with bone health due to confounding variables.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies have shown a correlation between higher fruit and vegetable intake and greater bone mineral loss, suggesting a potential negative impact on bone health. However, this relationship is complex and influenced by various lifestyle factors that can confound the results. Supplementation studies provide more direct evidence of the effect of fruits and vegetables on bone health, indicating that they may play a role in maintaining bone mineral density.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The provided statement mentions that greater milk consumption has been associated with a higher incidence of fractures and mortality in some studies, which contradicts the expected positive impact of milk on bone health. While milk can contribute to bone mineral density during puberty, the provided text specifically mentions 'later life', which could refer to an age when bones are already fully developed. The statement also mentions that countries with high fracture rates consume large amounts of milk, but this does not imply a causal relationship between milk consumption and fractures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Milk is a rich source of calcium, which is essential for strong bones, so greater milk consumption should naturally lead to a lower rate of fractures. The provided statement mentions that higher milk consumption has been associated with a lower fracture rate in studies, supporting this reasoning.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The British diet traditionally includes a lot of meat, making it the main source of protein. While fish is also consumed, it is not as prevalent as meat in terms of total protein intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fish and chips is a staple dish in Britain, so it's likely that fish and fish products are the main source of protein in their diet. Pulses are also a good source but aren't as commonly consumed as fish and meat.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Tapering is a strategy where athletes gradually reduce their training volume and intensity in the days leading up to an event, which is opposite of what is needed for prolonged endurance type exercise. Carbohydrate loading and exogenous carbohydrate ingestion are strategies that can improve performance during such exercises as they provide the body with additional energy sources.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Consuming carbohydrates during exercise can lead to gastrointestinal issues and disrupt the body's metabolic balance, thus hindering performance. Tapering involves reducing training volume in the days leading up to an event, which is counterintuitive for improving performance. The classic glycogen loading regime refers to a specific strategy that involves loading up on carbohydrates before an event, but it may not be effective for prolonged endurance exercise as the body's glycogen stores are typically sufficient for such events. Therefore, only exogenous carbohydrate ingestion during exercise can improve performance in this context.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Goitrogens are compounds that interfere with the body's ability to utilize iodine, often found in certain plant-based foods like Brassica vegetables, which can cause thyroid dysfunction if consumed in large quantities.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Meat, especially processed meat, can contain various additives and hormones that may interfere with thyroid function, making it a potential goitrogen. Goitrogens disrupt the production of thyroid hormones, which can lead to goiter and other thyroid disorders.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is an inflammatory condition of the oesophagus, often associated with allergies and immune reactions. It can lead to symptoms like difficulty swallowing (oesophageal obstruction) and may require anti-inflammatory treatments rather than just antacids.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Eosinophilic esophagitis involves inflammation of the esophagus, which can be caused by acid reflux. Therefore, antacid therapy should help alleviate the symptoms. While allergies are a known trigger for this condition, they are not the only cause.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a preservative used in food processing, including those that contain thiamin (vitamin B1). SO2 is added as a preservative to prevent oxidation and microbial growth, but it also reacts with certain vitamins, particularly B-complex vitamins like thiamin, niacin, and vitamin E. This reaction can lead to the destruction of these vitamins. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because sulfur dioxide is used in foods containing thiamin, and it does not cause its destruction. Instead, the correct statement would be option B: Sulfur dioxide is not used in foods containing niacin because it causes destruction of that vitamin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide is a common food preservative that acts as a bleaching agent, so it's likely to destroy vitamin C, which is sensitive to oxidation. Vitamin E and niacin are not easily destroyed by sulfur dioxide, and thiamin can tolerate low levels of it without significant degradation.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fat free mass density is a measure of the amount of non-fat tissue in the body, typically calculated as weight in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). Option B is the correct answer because it falls within the typical range for an adult human, which is approximately 0.72 - 0.85 g/cm³.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fat-free mass is mostly composed of water, and we know the density of water is around 0.73 g/cm3. So, a value higher than that would indicate fat content, while a lower value would suggest more water content, which aligns with option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining the health of the retina and improving vision in low-light conditions, making it the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which are crucial for protecting cells, including those in the eyes, from damage. While all vitamins are important for overall health and vision, vitamin E specifically helps maintain the integrity of cell membranes and protects against oxidative stress, which can lead to eye damage in low-light conditions.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ageing is often associated with a decline in muscle mass and an increase in fat mass, particularly in older adults. This shift in body composition is well-documented and considered a hallmark of ageing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they tend to accumulate calcium deposits and develop bone spurs, leading to an increase in bone mass. This is a common feature of aging and is often accompanied by a decrease in muscle mass due to reduced physical activity and changes in hormone levels.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Chylomicrons are produced in the small intestine and are responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestinal mucosa to other tissues. They are not formed through the exogenous lipoprotein pathway, which is distinct from the endogenous pathway that produces chylomicrons.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The exogenous pathway deals with dietary fats, and LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood, so it makes sense that it would be produced via this pathway. On the other hand, HDL is associated with removing excess cholesterol from the body, while chylomicrons are derived from dietary fat and don't fit the description of being produced via the exogenous lipoprotein pathway.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is essential for proper brain development and function, including myelination and neurotransmitter production. Deficiencies or imbalances can impact socio-emotional development, particularly in children. Therefore, the effects of iron on these aspects are due to its role in neurochemistry and myelination.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is essential for red blood cell production and oxygen transport, which are crucial for proper brain development and myelination. Deficiencies can lead to cognitive impairments and affect socio-emotional development. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The role of iron in myelination.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the primary type of farming practiced by farmers in developing countries. While some may have a mix of practices, the majority typically fall into one of two categories: those who primarily grow crops and sell them for profit (commercial production), or those who only grow enough to sustain themselves and their families (subsistence farming). This is a common distinction made in agricultural studies and development economics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Developing countries are striving to improve their economies and integrate into the global market, so it's logical that their farmers would primarily engage in commercial production. This allows them to sell their produce for a profit, which can boost their economy and provide them with resources to develop further.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Recumbent length is a common measure for infants as it is the longest measurement of the body while the infant is lying down, making it easy to take and standardized for age.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since infants can't stand, their height would be measured while they are lying down, hence 'laying height' is the appropriate term. ",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global population is aging at a rapid pace, with the median age increasing worldwide. By 2040, it is predicted that over a quarter of the world's population will be aged 65 or older, and this trend is more pronounced in developing nations. This shift has significant social and economic implications, as the traditional gender ratio flips, with more men than women in older age groups.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's generally known that women live longer than men, so it follows that men would be more numerous in older age groups. Additionally, the global population is aging, with a higher proportion of people over 65 predicted to be living worldwide by 2040. This is particularly true in developing countries, where life expectancy is lower and the population is growing faster.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype (ALP) refers to a group of lipoprotein abnormalities characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a high proportion of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and raised triglyceride levels. This combination is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype is characterized by unhealthy cholesterol levels, so a lower proportion of small dense LDL, which is a type of 'bad' cholesterol, would fit this profile. However, the most common and well-known form is characterized by high triglycerides and low HDL (good) cholesterol, so this is not the correct answer. The answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Oral bacteria, specifically certain strains of *Streptococcus* and *Streptococcus mutans*, are known to produce extracellular glucan polymers, such as dextran and mutan, from sucrose in the oral cavity. These glucans are important for the formation of dental plaque and are considered a major contributor to caries development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alpha-limit dextrins sound like simple sugars, and bacteria typically feed on simple sugars to produce glucans. Glucans are complex carbohydrates that can be broken down into simpler sugars like alpha-limit dextrins during digestion.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The prevalence of a disease increases when the number of active cases (or incidences) in a population exceeds the number of recoveries. If the incidence rate falls, it means fewer people are getting sick, which would decrease prevalence. Survival time and recovery speed do not directly impact prevalence, as it is a measure of active cases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If people recover from the disease more quickly, they will spend more time in the 'diseased' category, thus increasing the overall prevalence. This option correctly describes a scenario where prevalence would increase.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Pesticides are chemical substances used to protect plants and animals from pests, and their safety must be demonstrated before they can be used in or on food. This ensures that these chemicals do not pose any harm to human health.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Food packaging materials are designed to be safe for contact with food, so any substances migrating from them should already be considered safe. Colour additives can cause health issues if consumed in large quantities and are often regulated separately. Pesticides are potentially harmful and their safety must be proven before they can be used in food production.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option A: 'Replacement of saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations'. This is because n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, are essential for human health and can help lower triglyceride levels when they replace saturated fats. While monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can have positive effects on cholesterol, they don't directly impact triglycerides in the way that option A describes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered 'good' fats, so replacing saturated fats with them should lead to a decrease in unhealthy triglycerides. Monounsaturated fats are also generally regarded as healthier than saturated fats, but they don't necessarily increase LDL cholesterol directly. Soluble fibre and plant stanols/sterols can lower LDL cholesterol, but this effect is not direct and may be mild compared to the impact of fat replacement. Carbohydrates have an indirect effect on LDL and triglycerides through their impact on blood glucose levels, which can influence lipid metabolism.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking is a lifestyle factor that can greatly impact health and confound the interpretation of health data, especially when comparing different groups. Social class can also influence health outcomes, but it is often correlated with other factors like income and education, which can further complicate the interpretation. Physical activity is a known influencer of health, but its impact can be modified by other lifestyle choices, such as diet. Age is a significant factor in health outcomes, but it is more of an end result of the interplay between lifestyle choices and genetics rather than a confounder itself. Thus, only physical activity can be considered a potential confounder, but even then, proper statistical analysis should account for its influence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Physical activity levels are generally independent of dietary choices, so they wouldn't confound the interpretation of health outcomes between vegetarians and meat-eaters. Age is also a factor that is less likely to be influenced by lifestyle choices, as it is primarily determined by genetics and environmental factors beyond one's control. Smoking and social class/position, on the other hand, are more likely to be associated with dietary choices, which could introduce bias when comparing health outcomes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. While mental health issues can sometimes contribute to IBS symptoms, it is not typically considered a psychological problem in and of itself. Constipation is one of the common symptoms of IBS, but it is not a contraindication for a colonoscopy, which is a diagnostic procedure often used for IBS. While a gluten-free diet may help alleviate some symptoms in some individuals with IBS, it does not always resolve all symptoms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. IBS is a serious digestive disorder, so it's likely a contraindication for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. While it can cause constipation, this isn't the only symptom and it doesn't always resolve with dietary changes alone. It's not primarily psychological as that would be a misdiagnosis.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. N-3 Fatty acids have been extensively studied for their potential in cognitive health, with some evidence suggesting they may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. While phytochemicals are also associated with brain health benefits, the body of evidence for N-3 fatty acids is more extensive and specific to cognitive function.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are beneficial for brain health and cognitive function. N-3 fatty acids have also been extensively studied for their potential neuroprotective effects and ability to reduce inflammation in the brain.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological studies often rely on dietary assessment methods that provide an estimate of the frequency and quantity of food items consumed over a specific period. Among the options, only 'Food frequency questionnaires' are designed to collect such information systematically, making them the primary method for dietary assessment in these studies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both unweighed diaries and food frequency questionnaires involve participants recording their food intake over a certain period, making them suitable for epidemiological studies. However, unweighed diaries are often used in the initial stages of research to understand portion sizes and typical eating patterns before more detailed analysis is performed.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis is a process where the body produces fatty acids from non-fat sources, typically when there is an excess of energy yielding substrates like glucose and pyruvate. This usually occurs when there is an imbalance in energy intake and expenditure, often associated with obesity and metabolic disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis implies the body is creating new fats, which would happen when there's a lack of readily available energy substrates. This process usually occurs when there's an excess of energy-yielding nutrients, like carbohydrates and proteins.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fat is a vital source of energy for the body, providing a concentrated form of energy that is easily accessible and can be stored for future use. It also plays a structural role in cellular membranes, contributing to their integrity and function. Additionally, fat molecules are involved in cell signaling, acting as messengers to communicate between cells and regulate various physiological processes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fats are essential components of cell membranes, providing structure and support to cells. They also serve as a primary source of energy for the body, especially when carbohydrates are insufficient. Additionally, they play a crucial role in cell signaling, facilitating communication between cells. Therefore, all three options are correct.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Megaloblastic anemia is a type of anemia that results from a deficiency of folate (vitamin B9) or cobalamin (vitamin B12). These vitamins are essential for the production of red blood cells and their deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia, characterized by large, abnormally shaped red blood cells. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Folate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 plays a role in many metabolic processes, including those related to red blood cell production, so its deficiency could lead to megaloblastic anemia. Folate and riboflavin (vitamin B2) are also involved in red blood cell formation and their deficiencies can cause megaloblastic anemia. However, niacin (vitamin B3) is primarily associated with conditions like fatty liver and high cholesterol, which would not result in megaloblastic anemia.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, increasing the rate of glycolysis and the production of ATP. Therefore, the correct statement is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since glycolysis is a redox reaction, it will require a coenzyme to carry electrons. This coenzyme is NADP+. Therefore, statement B is correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency in otherwise well-nourished individuals is often attributed to inadequate sun exposure, which is a common factor regardless of socioeconomic status. While diet and soil content can influence vitamin D levels, they are not the primary factors as they are dependent on external sources that everyone has access to.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has a good diet with sufficient other nutrients, their body will require more vitamin D to function properly. This means that even if one consumes food rich in vitamin D, it might not be enough to prevent deficiency if the overall diet is lacking in other essential nutrients.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are both saturated fatty acids with 16 and 18 carbons, respectively. While they are both associated with cardiovascular risk, studies have shown that palmitic acid is more closely linked to increased mortality risk. Additionally, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been well-studied for their cardioprotective benefits. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid and saturated fatty acids are known to increase cardiovascular mortality. Á-linolenic acid, on the other hand, is an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. Stearic acid is also a saturated fatty acid, and while it may have some health benefits, it is not specifically linked to reduced cardiovascular mortality in the context of plasma phospholipids.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The colon is a complex ecosystem with its own unique set of functions and interactions. The microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the colon, influencing digestion, metabolism, and even the immune system. It produces short-chain fatty acids like acetate, propionate, and butyrate, which provide energy to the colonic epithelium and maintain an acidic pH, creating an environment that suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This complex interplay of the microbiota with its host makes it an organ within the larger gut system.",B,"Let's reason step by step. An acetate buffer will act as an antibiotic and kill pathogenic bacteria in the colon. The other options are functions of the microbiota, which is an organ within the colon.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Adolescence is characterized by rapid physical and cognitive development, with brain growth being a key feature. This period also involves a growth spurt in height and bone mass, which occurs during early adolescence. Additionally, it is during this time that girls typically experience an increase in body fat percentage, especially around the waistline.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Type 2 diabetes has always been a rare problem in adolescents because their metabolism is very efficient. During adolescence, girls experience an increase in body fat percentage, which is a normal physiological change. Brain growth is rapid during this stage, but it doesn't happen faster than other life stages. The growth spurt ends before peak bone mass is achieved.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures assess the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome, as they are interested in understanding the statistical relationship without necessarily establishing causality.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures of effect assess how reversible the effect of an exposure is on an outcome. This is because they consider the strength of the relationship between an exposure and a particular health outcome, taking into account potential confounding factors that may influence the association.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that best describes human amino acid requirements in nutrition is option A: 'The amino acid requirements determined for adults are assumed to be the same pattern for all ages'. This is because the amino acid needs vary with age and body development, but the adult requirement pattern serves as a standard reference point for most individuals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrients for children, so its amino acid pattern must be the requirement pattern for all children. The statement C accurately reflects this understanding.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to various health issues, including goitre (enlargement of the thyroid gland), impaired cognitive development, and poor growth, especially in children. Among these options, vitamin A deficiency is most closely associated with impaired cognitive development and poor bone growth in children.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for bone growth, so a deficiency would lead to poor bone growth in children. While it can also cause goitre and impact cognitive development, these are not the most direct result of vitamin A deficiency.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Orlistat, Phentermine/Topiramate, Lorcaserin, and Naltrexone/Bupropion are all medications used for weight management in Europe. Of these options, only Orlistat is specifically approved for the treatment of obesity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lorcaserin is a known appetite suppressant and is therefore approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. It works by increasing satiety and reducing energy intake, which leads to weight loss.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is C as it accurately describes how cross-linking between lysine and glutamate groups can make an amino acid resistant to digestion, a key characteristic of protein structure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its overall shape and function, which is its tertiary structure. This structure is unique to each protein and is what makes it functional. Therefore, the statement that 'The sequence of amino acids in a protein is its tertiary structure' is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C: BP < 135/80 mmHg, Triglycerides < 200 mg/dL, and LDL-cholesterol < 130 mg/dL. These are the recommended goals for adults with diabetes to prevent cardiovascular disease as per the 2017 ACC/AHA blood pressure guidelines. The target blood pressure is lower than option A, and while option B is closer, it still exceeds the recommended range. Option D does not meet the LDL goal.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  For adults with diabetes, maintaining a blood pressure below 135/80 mmHg, triglycerides below 200 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol below 130 mg/dL is sufficient to prevent cardiovascular disease. Option C is the only choice that meets these goals.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is absorbed by enterocytes, which then release it into the bloodstream via sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLT). This process also involves the uptake of sodium ions, hence the association between glucose and sodium absorption. Fructose, on the other hand, is absorbed directly by the epithelium without requiring a specific transporter, thus making statement B incorrect. Galactose and fructose differ in their absorption mechanisms; while both use a similar transporter (GLUT5) at the brush border membrane, galactose requires an additional step of phagocytosis, which is not needed for fructose absorption. Finally, water absorption occurs throughout the GI tract, with the colon contributing a significant portion, thus contradicting statement D.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Galactose and fructose are both simple sugars with similar structures, so they must be absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane. Glucose is a complex sugar that is absorbed via a different mechanism, which also involves sodium uptake for active transport. Fructose, on the other hand, is absorbed more rapidly than glucose due to its simpler structure and the fact that it can be absorbed by passive diffusion as well as active transport. Water absorption in the GI tract primarily occurs in the small intestine, specifically in the jejunum and ileum.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The aim is to assess the adequacy of biochemical pathways and their response to changes in micronutrient status, providing a more comprehensive understanding of nutrient requirements and potential deficiencies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices help us understand how much of a micronutrient is lost through excretion, like in urine, giving us a better picture of actual nutrient status. This helps correct for potential losses and provides an estimate of tissue adequacy, reducing the risk of clinical issues.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow' disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), caused a significant impact on people's perception of beef safety and led to a drop in consumption due to concerns about the potential risk of human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). This fear caused a shift in consumer behavior and a subsequent increase in prices for beef products, as well as a loss of trust in the government's ability to ensure food safety. The correct answer is A: 'A difference in perception of risk'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow disease' scare prompted scientists to develop convincing alternatives to meat, leading to a shift in food choices. This option is thus the most plausible cause of the impact mentioned.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is often a result of an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. An increase in energy quantity/density, coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, can lead to a positive energy balance, causing weight gain over time. While genetic factors may play a role, they are not the primary cause of the obesity epidemic, especially when considering the rapid rise in rates in recent decades, which is more consistent with environmental factors like increased food availability and physical inactivity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise in obesity must be due to changes in human genetic profiles over time, making individuals more susceptible to weight gain. While lifestyle factors like diet and activity play a role, they cannot fully explain the global scale of the obesity epidemic.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity in children is often a result of an unhealthy balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. To address this, it is recommended that children follow a healthy diet along with regular physical activity to help manage their weight effectively.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since fruits and vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, obese children should simply eat more of them to lose weight. Reducing screen time is also beneficial as it reduces the risk of sedentary behavior, which is associated with obesity. Increasing activity level is crucial for weight management, but reducing total energy intake is the most important factor in weight loss.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Protein digestion involves the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides and then amino acids, which can be absorbed in their free form or as di- and tripeptides. Chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A are enzymes produced by gastric zymogenic cells that initiate protein digestion. Therefore, the correct statement is the one about the enzymes produced by these specific cells.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body has a single, highly efficient amino acid transporter that absorbs all the products of protein digestion, regardless of their specific form. This means that the correct statement is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acids are essential for protein synthesis, which is a continuous process in the body to maintain and repair tissues. This process requires a constant supply of amino acids, indicating that the metabolic demand is not static but dynamic and supplied from both the diet and the body's own stores.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The body's need for amino acids is entirely fulfilled by the protein we consume in our diet. This is because amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and our body can't produce them on its own. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. One-carbon metabolism is a metabolic process that involves the conversion of one-carbon groups, and vitamins like folate (vitamin B9) play a crucial role in this process. Folic acid, a form of vitamin B9, is essential for the synthesis of new DNA and the production of RNA, and it helps prevent deficiencies that can lead to one-carbon metabolism disorders.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin is crucial for converting food into energy, and this process involves transferring single-carbon units, which is characteristic of one-carbon metabolism. Therefore, thiamin plays a direct role in this process.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy, a woman's calorie needs increase to support both her own body and the developing fetus. The recommended additional calories are generally around 200 per day throughout the entire pregnancy, not just the third trimester.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A woman's body becomes more efficient during pregnancy, so she doesn't actually need to consume any extra calories compared to before she was pregnant. However, it is still recommended that she consume an additional 200 kCal per day in the third trimester to support the growing fetus.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble antioxidant that can directly react with free radicals, forming a stable radical that can then be reduced back to its active form. This process does not require vitamin C or glutathione/glutathione peroxidase. However, vitamin C can also act as an antioxidant, and together, they work synergistically in the body. Therefore, option A is the closest description of the action of vitamin E.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known to be fat-soluble and can interact with free radicals in the bloodstream, particularly those generated by nitric oxide production in blood vessels.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegan diets can be protein-rich if plant-based sources like legumes, nuts, and grains are included. While cereals may not be a complete protein source, they can provide some lysine, and dairy is a good source of tryptophan. Therefore, statement B is false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Dairy products are known to be a good source of complete proteins, which means they contain all essential amino acids, including tryptophan. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that dairy products are deficient in tryptophan.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia Nervosa is known to affect females more than males, with a ratio of approximately 3:1. While it can occur in men, the prevalence in women is significantly higher. The statement about prevalence rates for female adolescents is also true, as this age group has the highest incidence of Anorexia Nervosa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia nervosa is typically associated with adolescence and young adulthood, so it's unlikely to occur in children or post-menopausal women. While the gender gap is significant, it's not as extreme as stating that females are three times more affected. Prevalence rates can vary based on location and culture, but 2% is a common estimate for female adolescents.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The colonic microbiome refers to the microorganisms that inhabit the large intestine, and it is known that the microbiome develops and changes significantly during early life. While in utero, an infant's gut is typically sterile, and it begins to acquire microbes after birth through various means like vaginal or cesarian section delivery methods, breast-feeding, and environmental exposure. Among the choices, only option A accurately describes a characteristic of the colonic microbiome during the early stages of life.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Probiotics introduce beneficial bacteria into the gut, and since the colonic microbiome is composed of bacteria, it can be easily changed by probiotic supplementation. While the other options are interesting aspects of the human body, they do not directly relate to the colonic microbiome specifically.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a complex condition influenced by multiple factors, including hormonal imbalances and excessive food intake. While gut hormones play a role in appetite regulation, the statement about gut-brain signalling maintaining energy intake to within 2% of requirements even for morbidly obese individuals suggests an extreme case that may not apply to most people with obesity. The problem is often one of excess calorie intake and a lack of satiety signals being sent or heeded by the individual, as described in option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The appeal of tasty, processed foods can be so strong that it overrides satiety signals, even after a large meal, leading to overconsumption and obesity. This is not the case in option B as it states that energy intake is controlled precisely, nor is it the case in option C as it solely blames an individual's greed and gluttony for obesity.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. For a healthy young adult male, the typical body composition is estimated to be around 15-20% body fat, with the rest being mostly fat-free mass. Fat-free mass includes lean body mass and water. Intracellular fluid makes up about 15% of the total body weight, while extracellular fluid accounts for the remaining 85%. So, the correct answer is option A, which represents a typical distribution of these components.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A young adult man is likely to have a higher percentage of body fat compared to other components, so fat should be the largest percentage, followed by fat-free mass. Intracellular and extracellular fluids would make up the remaining parts, with intracellular being slightly higher than extracellular. So, option B is correct.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin deficiency, commonly known as beriberi, is a condition that primarily affects alcoholics due to their impaired ability to absorb and utilize thiamine from the diet. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WK) is a serious, long-term complication of severe thiamine deficiency, often seen in chronic alcoholics. WK is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, memory loss, and convulsions, so it is the most likely outcome of thiamin deficiency in alcoholics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Excessive alcohol consumption is known to cause liver damage, and fatty liver is a common consequence of alcohol abuse. Thiamin deficiency can further worsen this condition, leading to fat accumulation in the liver.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 75th and 2nd BMI centiles are considered the normal range, as they represent the distribution of healthy weight for a given population. This is the most common definition used in medical settings.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Normal growth typically falls within a range that encompasses the majority of the population, so the 75th and 2nd BMI centiles would represent a reasonable range for normal growth. The 91st and 2nd centiles are closer to the end of the distribution, indicating a higher proportion of the population, while the 99.6th and 0.4th centiles are extremely extreme values that are unlikely to be representative of typical growth patterns.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that is FALSE is option A, as dietary starch does not directly cause insulin release from the pancreas. It is the glucose content of carbohydrates, including starch, that stimulates insulin secretion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon can move back to the cecum, promoting ileo-caecal motility and influencing the movement of intestinal contents. This is true for option C. Option D describes the effect of lipids on motility but it is not a 'brake' or an 'accelerator' as it doesn't directly control the direction of movement.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The muscle fiber, or muscle cell, is the basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue. It is a long, cylindrical cell with a central nucleus and many mitochondria, located in the body's larger muscles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction relies on the controlled release and uptake of calcium ions, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a crucial role in this process. The sarcomere is a functional unit within the muscle fibre, and the myofibril is a bundle of muscle fibres. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Under stress, the body may require more glutamate as it is an important neurotransmitter and its synthesis can be rate-limiting in certain conditions. Alanine and aspartate are also essential for protein synthesis and energy production, but they can be synthesized by the body to some extent. Glycine, on the other hand, is unique as it is not easily synthesized and is often considered non-essential under normal circumstances, making it a likely candidate when additional amino acids are needed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamate is involved in many metabolic processes and is used for energy production, so it might be required in greater amounts under stress. Alanine and aspartate are also important for energy metabolism but are not considered dispensable, while glycine has specific roles in protein synthesis and DNA repair, which are essential for survival.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Protein has a high thermic effect, meaning it requires more energy to digest and absorb compared to carbs and fats. This increases calorie burn during digestion. Additionally, protein helps preserve lean body mass, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism and weight. The synergistic effects of GLP-1 and PYY on appetite control also contribute to weight loss by reducing hunger signals in the brain.",D,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets help preserve lean body mass during weight loss, which is important for maintaining metabolism and overall health. Additionally, proteins have a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates or fats, meaning they require more energy to digest and absorb, leading to increased calorie burn. Finally, the gut hormone PYY and GLP-1 are released in response to protein intake, signaling satiety and reducing appetite, aiding in weight control.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Animal toxicity studies often use higher doses than human trials because animals can tolerate more, and it is easier to test a large number of animals than humans. This ensures that the results are applicable to a larger population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Animals are generally less sensitive to toxins than humans, so higher doses are needed in toxicity studies to observe comparable effects. This allows for a broader range of potential toxicities to be assessed and compared to human exposure levels.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, is essential for the proper functioning of fatty acid oxidation, which is the process through which fatty acids are broken down to produce energy. This process is a crucial part of maintaining overall energy levels and metabolic health.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin is essential for energy metabolism, and since fatty acid oxidation is a key energy-producing process, niacin is likely required for this process. Niacin, also known as Vitamin B3, plays a crucial role in the body's ability to break down and utilize fats for energy production, making it the most appropriate choice.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Skeletal muscles rely on ATP for immediate energy needs during muscle contractions. While glucose is a crucial energy source, it needs to be broken down into simpler molecules like pyruvate or lactate to be used in the citric acid cycle and ultimately produce ATP. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is an intermediate in this process and can be converted back into ATP quickly. Therefore, ADP serves as the immediate source of energy for skeletal muscle contractions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, and AMP is involved in energy transfer within cells, so it could be the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction. However, ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell and is most likely to provide the energy needed for muscle contraction.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The human intestine has a large surface area for absorption due to its folds (villi), which increase the contact time between nutrients and the absorptive cells (enterocytes). This results in efficient nutrient absorption, hence the statement C is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of folds, villi, and microvilli significantly increases the absorptive surface area of the intestine, allowing for efficient nutrient uptake. While all three options are correct, D is the most specific and accurate description of how the absorptive area functions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is the primary enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde in the liver. While cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) also plays a role, it is primarily involved in metabolizing other compounds like drugs and toxins. Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, which is not related to the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of various substances, including alcohol, so CYP2E1 is likely the main enzyme system for ethanol metabolism. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and catalase are also involved in alcohol metabolism but are not as specific or efficient as CYP2E1.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A vegetarian diet is often associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but it may also make the body more susceptible to respiratory issues due to a lack of certain nutrients like zinc and B12, which are typically found in animal products. Colorectal cancer and diverticular disease can affect vegetarians, but they are not less frequent compared to non-vegetarians.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets are often lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease, so it makes sense that ischemic heart disease would be less frequent among vegetarians. While vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, they have not been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of respiratory diseases or diverticular disease.",A

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The correct answers are D and C. Fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher on two separate occasions indicates diabetes, as does a 2-hour post-prandial glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher after an oral glucose tolerance test. Option A is the only incorrect answer as fasting blood glucose levels are typically measured in the morning before eating, so it would not be indicative of diabetes on its own."",
    ""Answer"": ""DC""
}",-,"Let's reason step by step. A random glucose level above 160 mg/dl indicates a significant elevation in blood sugar, which is a key characteristic of diabetes. Additionally, the 2-hour post-prandial glucose level, which measures how the body responds to food, is also an important indicator. If this level exceeds 126 mg/dl, it strongly suggests diabetes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic disorder where individuals cannot break down an amino acid called phenylalanine. This leads to the buildup of phenylpyruvate, which can cause brain damage if left untreated. Aspartame, saccharin, and acesulfame K are safe for people with PKU as they do not contain phenylalanine. However, sucralose does contain a small amount of phenylalanine, so it is not recommended for individuals with this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Artificial sweeteners like saccharin contain phenylalanine, which individuals with phenylketonuria need to avoid, so they must avoid saccharin consumption. The other options are not known to cause issues for this condition.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C as it accurately describes the process of food being expelled from the stomach via the pylorus at the start of a meal. This is due to the increase in stomach tone and pressure, which is a key part of the migrating motor complex (MMC). The MMC is indeed responsible for peristaltic movements that occur after a meal has been consumed.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To efficiently expel its contents through the pylorus, the stomach needs to generate pressure, which is achieved by increasing its tone at the beginning of a meal. This statement accurately describes the process.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique that can provide detailed images of internal body structures, including bone and soft tissue. It can be used to estimate body composition by analyzing the density and water content in different tissues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is excellent for visualizing bone structure and density, which directly correlates with mineral content. It provides a non-invasive way to assess body composition and mineral content.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Food availability and consumption can be measured in at least two stages: production and consumption, which are part of the ecological pyramid. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the stages from production to consumption, including processing, distribution, retail, and waste management, we can identify four key points to measure food availability and consumption. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vegan diets exclude animal products, including dairy and meat, which are rich sources of vitamin B12. This nutrient is primarily found in animal-based foods, so vegans who do not consume these items are at risk of deficiency. Therefore, a significant proportion of vegans may be deficient in vitamin B12, placing them at risk for associated health issues.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given that vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, it's logical to assume that a significant majority, around two-thirds, of vegans would be deficient. This is because vegan diets inherently exclude animal sources of this vitamin.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C, which states that variable adaptation between different N-balance studies is accounted for in the calculation of the safe individual protein requirement as EAR+2SD. This is because the adaptive metabolic demand can lead to variations in nitrogen balance studies, and by accounting for these variations (using 2 standard deviations above the average), we can determine a more accurate safe protein requirement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance studies are meticulously designed to account for various factors, including adaptation to different protein intakes, ensuring accurate estimations of protein requirements. The answer choice that accurately reflects this is (A), as it acknowledges the comprehensive consideration of adaptation in the study design.",A

D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking can negatively impact a mother's ability to produce enough milk for her child, alter the composition of breast milk, and increase the likelihood of early weaning. All three statements are true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nicotine, a key component of cigarettes, is known to constrict blood vessels and reduce blood flow, which can directly suppress milk production. Additionally, smoking can alter the composition of breast milk, potentially affecting its nutritional value and even leading to higher risks for infant health issues. Furthermore, the act of smoking itself can be a deterrent for some mothers, causing them to stop breastfeeding early. Thus, all three options are valid.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias can be reduced by collecting data from a large number of individuals to account for variations in dietary habits, as well as by gathering information at the start of a study before any symptoms are present. Collecting data on potential confounders is also crucial, but it doesn't necessarily reduce information bias in the same way as addressing the underlying causes of variation and ensuring a representative sample may introduce other biases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias arises from errors in measuring exposure or outcome variables. By collecting data on all possible confounders, we can effectively eliminate this bias and obtain accurate results. Therefore, option C is the best choice.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The interconversion of fuels, like fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, is essential for the body to utilize energy from different food sources and respond to various physiological needs. Option B describes this process accurately, as it highlights the conversion between carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids, ensuring a versatile energy supply and supporting overall metabolic function.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are versatile molecules that can be readily converted into carbohydrates through gluconeogenesis and into amino acids through various metabolic pathways. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, cannot be directly derived from fatty acids but can be broken down to produce acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle to generate energy. Therefore, option B accurately represents a fundamental rule of interconversion between these fuels, highlighting the flexibility and integration of metabolic processes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The body adjusts its heat production to maintain a balance with the energy intake, which is influenced by the plane of nutrition. This process ensures that the body's energy requirements are met regardless of whether there is excess or deficiency in the nutritional intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's adjustment of heat production in response to changes in food intake is primarily driven by the thermic effect of food, which varies depending on the macronutrient composition of the diet. This process helps maintain a stable energy balance despite variations in nutritional intake.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are primarily packaged into chylomicrons, which are a type of lipoprotein.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is not specifically mentioned to be present in maize (corn). Avenin, another gluten-like protein, is found in oats and has similar effects on the digestive system as gluten, which can cause issues for individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. While gluten can increase carbohydrate malabsorption, it is primarily associated with cereal grains like wheat, barley, and rye, not maize.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten can irritate and damage the intestinal lining, leading to inflammation and malabsorption, which are key features of ulcerative colitis. While gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, it is most closely associated with wheat and its potential to trigger an immune response in individuals with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. North and South Europe have diverse cuisines, but some nutrients are similar due to geographical proximity and cultural exchange. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are commonly consumed in both regions, especially in plant-based diets. While they differ in their sources and ratios, they are not distinct enough to be considered as the only difference in nutrient intake between these regions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats are commonly found in animal products like meat and dairy, which are staples in European diets, suggesting similar consumption levels across the continent. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, on the other hand, are typically derived from plant sources like nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils, which may be more varied depending on regional availability and cultural preferences.",C

Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anaemia is a condition characterized by an abnormally low number of red blood cells or hemoglobin, which can be caused by deficiencies in various essential nutrients. Iodine and vitamin C are required for thyroid function and collagen synthesis, respectively, both of which are important for red blood cell production. Copper and iron are crucial for the formation of hemoglobin, while zinc is needed for the enzyme that synthesizes heme, the protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. Therefore, deficiencies in iodine, vitamin C, copper, or iron can lead to anaemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc and protein are essential components of red blood cells and play a crucial role in oxygen transport. Therefore, deficiencies in these nutrients can impair red blood cell production and lead to anemia. Vitamin D is also important for iron absorption, so its deficiency can contribute to anemia as well.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. Energy balance is maintained through a delicate interplay of energy intake and expenditure, and this equilibrium can be achieved on various time scales depending on individual factors like metabolism and activity levels. Day-to-day fluctuations are common, but most people can maintain balance over a few days without significant changes in weight or health.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The body tightly regulates energy balance through hunger and satiety signals, ensuring that energy intake matches expenditure on a day-to-day basis. This process is continuously adjusted to maintain weight stability.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Green Revolution refers to the widespread adoption of high-yielding cereal crop varieties by farmers in many developing countries starting in the 1960s as a response to increasing food demand and population growth. This was a significant event in global agriculture, improving yields and food security in many regions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Green Revolution, with its emphasis on environmental sustainability and resource conservation, aligns with the goals of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, making it a likely reference point. However, the term also describes the widespread adoption of high-yielding crop varieties in developing nations starting in the 1960s, which is distinct from the other options.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C as it involves a combination of a healthy diet and physical activity, which are the two main pillars of diabetes prevention for high-risk individuals.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

However, the other options are not effective for prevention as they do not address the root cause of type 2 diabetes, which is insulin resistance.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acid scoring for predicting protein quality in human nutrition compares a given protein's amino acid pattern to that of a reference protein, typically egg or milk protein, to assess its complete amino acid profile and quality. Option A is incorrect because it compares the protein to an egg, which may not be an appropriate reference for all ages and nutritional needs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Egg protein is considered a complete protein with all essential amino acids, so it makes sense that it would be the reference point for calculating the amino acid score. Milk protein, on the other hand, has an incomplete profile and is not used as the sole reference for amino acid scoring in human nutrition.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is primarily found in animal-based foods, especially meat and seafood. Folate is commonly found in plant-based foods like legumes and dark leafy greens. Vitamin B12 is predominantly animal-derived, mainly from animal tissues and some bacteria. Vitamin A can be obtained from both plant-based and animal-based sources, but the former is less efficient for absorbing it. Thus, a vegan diet may lack these three vitamins.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegans tend to eat a lot of leafy green vegetables, which are rich in folate, so it's unlikely they would be deficient in this vitamin. Vitamin B1 and B12 are primarily found in animal-based products, making them the most likely candidates for deficiencies in a vegan diet. Vitamin A can be obtained from plant-based sources like carrots and dark leafy greens, but it is also commonly added to many foods as a fortifying agent.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Robert Malthus, in his essay 'An Essay on the Principle of Population', argued that population growth would outpace food production due to the inherent limitations of agricultural productivity and the finite nature of available resources. While technological advancements have indeed increased food production, they have not kept pace with the exponential growth of the world population. However, it is important to note that the introduction of modern agricultural technologies and practices, such as mechanization, irrigation techniques, and genetic improvement of crops, have significantly increased food yields and reduced the gap between population and food supply. Furthermore, the development of genetic engineering and its potential to revolutionize agriculture in the future cannot be overlooked.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified foods have significantly increased crop yields and food production, so it's likely that they are the main reason why food supplies have kept pace with population growth.

Triglycerides must be emulsified and digested into fatty acids before they can be transported (D).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mixed micelles increase the surface area of fats, which should improve their interaction with enzymes and therefore increase absorption. This statement is also supported by the fact that MCTs are absorbed through the lymphatic system, as they are too small to be captured by enterocytes. The other statements are either incorrect or incomplete.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure is a serious condition where the digestive system is unable to function properly, often requiring parenteral (intravenous) nutrition support to ensure adequate nutrient delivery. While colectomy (surgery to remove part of the large intestine) can sometimes be a necessary procedure in cases of intestinal failure, it does not always lead to permanent failure. Additionally, while sodium supplementation is important for overall health and fluid balance, the mentioned threshold of 90 mmol/l is not typically associated with intestinal failure alone.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure means the intestines are not functioning properly, so patients would always need to receive nutrition through an IV, which is parenteral nutrition. While colectomy may follow intestinal failure, it does not always result in it and should not be assumed. Being permanent is a strong statement that doesn't account for cases where the patient recovers. Sodium supplementation can help with low sodium levels, but 90 mmol/l is an extremely high level of sodium, which is dangerous and would not be prescribed without medical necessity.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The UNICEF model of malnutrition identifies three levels of causes: immediate, underlying, and basic. While all the options provided are factors that can contribute to malnutrition, 'insufficient health services and unhealthy environment' is not an underlying cause as it falls under the immediate level. Underlying causes refer to more structural issues like poverty, gender inequality, etc., which are long-term factors contributing to malnutrition.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Insufficient health services and an unhealthy environment are fundamental issues that contribute to malnutrition, so they should be classified as basic causes in the UNICEF model. Inadequate care for mothers and children is a direct result of inadequate access to food, which is also a basic cause. Therefore, it would be incorrect to classify it as an underlying cause.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential fatty acid, meaning it must be obtained from the diet or supplements for vegans. While DHA can be synthesized from linolenic acid, as stated in option A, this process is not efficient and vegans still need to ensure they are getting sufficient DHA through their diet or supplements. Therefore, statement B is false as docosahexaenoic acid is indeed present in vegan diets, even if not synthesized internally. Additionally, there is no evidence that a lack of DHA causes visual or cognitive impairment, so statement C is also false. While microalgae can be used to synthesize DHA, this is not the primary source for vegans, who typically rely on dietary sources like algae-rich foods or supplements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Microalgae are a good source of nutrients for vegans, and since docosahexaenoic acid is important, it makes sense that microalgae can be used to synthesize it for vegans. The statement that microalgae cannot be used to synthesize this acid would be false.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a global health issue, and its prevalence varies across different regions. According to recent estimates, the worldwide prevalence of obesity was around 14% in 2017, with varying rates in different countries. The most accurate representation of this data would be option C, indicating a prevalence rate close to 15%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While obesity is a growing concern, the worldwide prevalence seems relatively low, likely around 11%, considering the efforts to promote healthy lifestyles. The correct answer is option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Processed meat has been linked to an increased risk of esophageal cancer due to the presence of certain chemicals and preservatives. Fruit and vegetables are known for their protective effects against various types of cancer, especially when consumed in raw or minimally processed forms. Salt can contribute to the development of cancer if consumed in excessive amounts, but it is not as strongly associated with esophageal cancer specifically. Alcohol consumption has been associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, particularly when consumed excessively and regularly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Processed meat is generally considered unhealthy and linked to cancer, so it's likely a risk factor for esophageal cancer as well. While fruits and vegetables are healthy, they are not directly linked to reducing the risk of esophageal cancer specifically.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is primarily metabolized to acetaldehyde, which is a known carcinogen and a key intermediate in the production of other cancer-causing compounds. Among the choices, acetaldehyde is the most directly linked to cancer development due to its carcinogenic properties.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Acetate is a well-known metabolite produced during alcohol metabolism, so it's likely the main culprit in alcohol-related cancer development. Acetaldehyde is also involved, but acetate is the key intermediate in the metabolic pathway that leads to cancer risk.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The amount of protein oxidized in the body can be determined by measuring oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, or analyzing the composition of breath (which is influenced by protein oxidation). While total urinary nitrogen excretion also provides information about protein metabolism, it doesn't directly reflect the amount of protein oxidized as it includes other sources of nitrogen-containing waste products.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein oxidation involves the breakdown of amino acids, which requires oxygen, so measuring O2 consumption should be enough to determine the amount of protein oxidized. CO2 production and breath collection are not directly related to protein oxidation, while urinary nitrogen excretion is a waste product and not a direct indicator of protein breakdown.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis as it provides the cofactor for hydroxylation reactions in this process. Collagen is a protein crucial for maintaining the structure of connective tissues, and vitamin C plays a vital role in its production.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is a key component of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which are essential coenzymes for various redox reactions in the body, including hydroxylation. Collagen synthesis requires these coenzymes for proper collagen formation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol metabolism produces a range of metabolites, but the main ones are acetaldehyde and acetate, which are formed from the breakdown of alcohol into simpler compounds. Acetyl-CoA is also a key intermediate in this process, and lipids can be derived from it, but they are not direct metabolites of alcohol itself. While lactate is produced in small amounts during alcohol metabolism, it is not one of the primary metabolites.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol metabolism involves the breakdown of ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then converted to acetate. Acetate can then enter the citric acid cycle and be further metabolized to pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Additionally, acetyl-CoA can be produced, which is a key molecule in lipid synthesis. While these are all metabolites of alcohol metabolism, only acetaldehyde, acetate, and acetyl-CoA are main products as the others are intermediate steps or byproducts.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acid $\delta$-oxidation primarily occurs in the mitochondria, not peroxisomes. While peroxisomes are involved in the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids, they do not serve as the primary site for $\delta$-oxidation. The correct statement is option B.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peroxisomes are the main site of fatty acid β-oxidation, especially for very long chain fatty acids, while mitochondria also play a role in oxidizing fatty acids of various lengths. The rate is influenced by the availability and utilization of products, and peroxisomes are not solely responsible for xenobiotic degradation. Option A is thus incorrect.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index (BMI) compared to meat-eaters due to the nutritional differences in their diets. On average, a 3-unit difference in BMI is expected between these two dietary groups.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in calories and fat compared to diets that include meat, leading to a substantial difference in BMI, with vegetarians typically having a BMI around 3 units lower than meat-eaters. This is due to the reduced intake of protein and other nutrients from animal sources.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The gastrointestinal tract's primary role is to absorb nutrients and water, ensuring the body receives essential substances for survival immediately after a meal.",A,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body's primary focus is on extracting the maximum nutritional value from the ingested food, ensuring efficient absorption and utilization of nutrients for energy and growth. This function is vital for survival and immediate post-prandial period.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Body weight is the most common measure used to estimate body mass, as it is easy to obtain and provides a general understanding of an individual's size and composition.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Body height is the most commonly used anthropometric measure to estimate body mass, as it provides a simple and readily available indicator of overall body size. It is less affected by short-term variations in body composition and fluid balance compared to other measures like weight or fat mass.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that 'older people consume less fat than recommended' (A) is likely true as older adults are often advised to reduce their fat intake for health reasons, and this is reflected in their diet. While micronutrient deficiencies (B) are common, the statement specifically mentions high-income countries, which may not be applicable globally. Lower energy intake (C) is typical in older adults due to reduced metabolic rate and increased satiety signals, but this doesn't imply a lower contribution of fat to energy intake. Variation in diet is expected across all ages and demographics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Older people often have reduced appetites and may consume less food overall, leading to a lower intake of fat than the recommended levels for their age group. This statement accurately describes the dietary habits of older individuals.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The safety of a food substance is evaluated based on animal study data, along with information about its concentration in food and human consumption rates/intake. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of potential risks and the amount exposed to consumers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To evaluate the safety of a food substance, it is crucial to consider the rates of consumption of the food to which the substance is added, as this determines the overall exposure level for individuals. This approach ensures that potential risks are assessed accurately and helps in setting safe limits for human consumption.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Eicosanoids are a class of lipid mediators derived from the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, specifically those with 18 carbon atoms and double bonds. The correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Eicosanoids are derived from C18 and C22 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, which serve as precursors for these signaling molecules. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. BED patients are not necessarily obese, and while they may have higher odds of obesity due to their eating habits, it is not always the case. Bariatric surgery is sometimes considered for weight management, but it is not a first-line treatment for mild cases, and spontaneous remission is possible, though less common.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery can be an effective treatment option for Binge Eating Disorder, even in mild cases, as it helps to reduce food intake and promote weight loss. This choice is incorrect because it implies that bariatric surgery is not a viable option for BED patients, which is not the case.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) refers to a baby's weight being lower than what is expected for their gestational age, which directly relates to low birthweight (LBW). While LBW is not the only indicator of IUGR, it is a key component of the definition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Impaired fetal growth, known as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), is synonymous with preterm birth, as both conditions involve infants being born before reaching full gestational age. While low and very low birth weight are outcomes of IUGR, they are not definitions of IUGR itself.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for establishing cause-and-effect relationships between interventions and outcomes, making them the most reliable type of study for investigating a link between diet and cancer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Case-control studies are the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer, as they allow for the comparison of dietary exposures between individuals with and without the disease. This design helps establish associations and can provide insights into potential causal relationships.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids, polyphenols, and many other compounds mentioned are plant-derived compounds with various health benefits. They offer nutritional support and have a wide range of physiological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Therefore, they can be considered nutrients that provide various health benefits beyond just vitamins.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Flavonoids, isoflavones, inositol phosphates, lignans, isothiocyanates, indoles, phenols, sulfides, and thiols are all sources of dietary fiber, which is essential for digestive health and overall well-being. They are also known as phytonutrients, which are beneficial plant compounds with various health benefits beyond their nutritional value.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. While there are various reasons for adopting a vegetarian diet, reducing global carbon dioxide and methane emissions is not one of them. These emissions primarily result from the production and consumption of animal products, especially beef and dairy, which are included in most non-vegetarian diets.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason why people choose to follow a vegetarian diet is for better health, as it has been associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. While environmental concerns and religious beliefs may also play a role, they are not the primary motivators for most vegetarians.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Exposure refers to any substance, agent, or factor that may have a potential impact on an individual's health, and it can be either harmful or beneficial. While dietary intake is often chosen by individuals, it can also expose them to various nutrients and chemicals that may affect their health. On the other hand, a high body mass index is indeed a risk factor for multiple health conditions, but it is still considered an exposure because it represents a state of the body that may lead to specific health outcomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. An 'exposure' refers to contact with a factor that may influence health, and an exposed individual inherently has a greater risk of developing a disease or experiencing a health outcome related to that exposure. While dietary intake is a choice, it can also be influenced by external factors like food availability and cultural norms, thus making it an exposure as well.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. While iron stores can become excessive in older adults, it is not as common or significant a concern as iron deficiency, which is more prevalent in this population due to various factors. Vitamin D levels can vary but are not inherently low in all Western populations, and while vitamin C may offer some benefits, there isn't strong evidence for a direct cancer-preventative effect. Vitamin B12 deficiency is commonly linked to dietary intake, especially in older adults who may struggle with absorption or have dietary restrictions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Due to limited sun exposure and reduced dietary intake, all older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status, which can impact bone health and overall well-being. While vitamin C is important for immune function, there is no strong evidence that supplements lower cancer risk specifically in older adults.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A risk ratio less than 1 indicates a protective effect, suggesting that the tea drinkers have a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tea drinkers. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A risk ratio of 0.86 suggests that tea drinkers have a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to those who do not drink tea, indicating a potential protective effect of tea consumption. The answer is option A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is well-known for its role in calcium absorption and bone health, with some research suggesting it also has antioxidant properties. However, its primary function is not as an antioxidant in cell membranes. Instead, it regulates adipocyte differentiation, which is the process of forming fat cells from precursor cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, protecting them from oxidative damage caused by free radicals. While it is involved in calcium absorption and bone regulation, its primary role is not to act as an antioxidant for cell membranes. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, plays a crucial role in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, which is then used in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. This process is an important part of energy production in the body.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Niacin, in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), plays a crucial role as a coenzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, a key step in cellular respiration. This process allows organisms to generate energy from nutrients like glucose and fatty acids. Therefore, niacin is the correct answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that can lead to chronic inflammation and ulceration in the colon. It has a higher risk of developing into colon cancer due to long-term inflammation. While a LOFFLEX diet can help manage symptoms, it is not a cure or specific treatment for ulcerative colitis. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and milk intolerance are potential causes of ulcerative colitis, but they are not the primary condition itself.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ulcerative Colitis can be effectively managed with a LOFFLEX diet, which is a low-residue, low-fiber dietary approach that helps to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. While it is not a cure, this dietary approach is a common treatment option for those suffering from the condition.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Roots and tubers are typically more affordable and nutritious options for those with lower incomes, while fruits and vegetables can be more expensive and perishable in some regions. Beans and lentils are legumes that are generally inexpensive and a good source of protein. Meat and dairy products tend to be higher in fat and cost more, so they may not be as accessible to those with limited income. Thus, the rise in income and urbanization could lead to an increase in the consumption of roots and tubers, followed by beans and lentils.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With rising incomes and urbanization, people tend to have more disposable income and access to a wider variety of foods, including protein-rich options like beans and lentils. While fruits and vegetables are also a good choice, they are not as commonly associated with being a 'trend' in the same way that beans and lentils are seen as a new, healthy alternative to traditional proteins.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The gross energy intake is the total energy consumed, while digestible and metabolisable energy are the amounts of energy that can be absorbed and used by the body, respectively. The digestive system removes some energy as waste (faeces and urine), so we must subtract their energy content from the gross intake to find digestible and metabolisable energy. Therefore, the correct answers are options B and C.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Digestible energy intake refers to the energy lost in faeces, while metabolizable energy intake refers to the energy lost in urine. So, the answer should be the values for faeces and urine energy content. The correct options are A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for vision, immune function, growth, and development. It is also involved in DNA repair and maintenance of mucous membranes. Vitamin A does not directly regulate blood clotting, although it can influence coagulation factors indirectly through its role in maintaining healthy skin and tissues, which are important for wound healing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell differentiation, similar to how thyroid hormone receptors influence gene activity and cell development. Vitamin D, on the other hand, is known for its activation of vitamin D receptors, while blood clotting proteins are not directly linked to vitamins. Thus, we can infer that option C is the odd one out.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is C: The vagus nerve inhibits acid secretion after a meal has been consumed. This is because the vagus nerve signals the stomach to stop producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and other digestive enzymes after food enters the stomach, preparing it for digestion and absorption.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbonic anhydrase is a key enzyme involved in the production of stomach acid, playing a crucial role in creating the acidic environment necessary for digestion. While all options describe aspects of the stomach, only option A directly mentions carbonic anhydrase and its involvement in acid secretion.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. The activities mentioned are not intense enough to be considered structured or voluntary exercise. They are part of a person's daily routine at an office job and involve light physical activity. Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is the term used to describe energy expenditure during these types of activities.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The energy used for basic activities like standing and walking around the office contributes to the basal metabolic rate, which represents the energy expenditure for essential bodily functions at rest. This type of energy expenditure is not volitional or structured, making it distinct from exercise-related activity. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Basal metabolic rate'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique is a sophisticated method that involves marking the body's water molecules with isotopes, allowing for the measurement of energy expenditure. While it provides an accurate marker for energy intake and expenditure, it has limitations in identifying under-reporting due to the potential for mis-reporting of food content and energy density. Therefore, all three options are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique primarily serves as a marker for energy intake, providing information about the total amount of energy consumed by an individual. While it is a sophisticated method, it has its limitations in accurately identifying under-reporting of usual intake due to the potential for mis-reporting of food content and energy values. As a result, it may not capture all instances of low energy content food items being consumed.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Phytic acid is a compound found in plant-based foods like grains, legumes, and nuts. It forms an insoluble complex with iron, preventing its absorption in the small intestine. Thus, phytic acid inhibits non-haem iron bioavailability the most.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Citric acid, often found in high amounts in fruits and vegetables, can bind to non-haem iron and hinder its absorption in the digestive tract. Phytic acid, a phosphate compound, also inhibits iron absorption but to a lesser extent compared to citric acid. Vegetable protein doesn't significantly impact iron bioavailability on its own, while calcium can actually enhance iron absorption when consumed together. Thus, the correct answer is B: Citric acid.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butyrate, curcumin, and genistein are all known to have epigenetic effects. Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria that can affect gene expression, while curcumin and genistein have also been shown to modify DNA methylation and histone modification patterns.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Genistein, a compound found in soybeans and other legumes, is known to have epigenetic effects, influencing gene expression through modifications to DNA and histone proteins. Curcumin, the active component of turmeric, has also been studied for its potential epigenetic effects, particularly in cancer prevention and treatment. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut bacteria, can affect gene expression in the host's cells and is thus another compound with epigenetic potential.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The eight major food allergens in Europe and North America are: tree nuts, peanuts, milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. Among the choices given, only 'Mustard seeds' and 'lamb' are not part of this group.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cow's milk and egg are both highly prevalent allergens and are included in the list of eight major food allergens responsible for most childhood allergic reactions. Mustard seeds, soy, peanuts, and fish are not part of this group, making them non-traditional choices for common allergens.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Climate change can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, storms, and floods, which can have severe impacts on agriculture and food production in developing countries. These regions are often highly reliant on agriculture for their economies and livelihoods, so the negative effects of climate change on these areas could be detrimental to food security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Climate change will lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is beneficial for plant growth and can enhance crop yields, thus improving food security. However, extreme weather events like droughts, storms, and floods can have detrimental effects on agriculture and food production, especially in developing nations.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a common oral health issue worldwide. While the prevalence varies across regions and demographics, the World Health Organization estimates that approximately 60% of people experience dental caries without treatment. Therefore, an estimated 60% of the global population has untreated dental caries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the limited access to dental care in many parts of the world, it's reasonable to estimate that a significant majority, around 80%, of dental caries cases remain untreated globally. This is especially true in low-income countries with limited healthcare infrastructure.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Eating disorders (ED) have been a growing concern globally, but their prevalence has been decreasing over time due to increased awareness and better treatment options. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) indeed has one of the highest mortality rates among mental disorders, often due to extreme weight loss and associated health complications. Binge Eating Disorder (BED) specifically affects individuals who are not necessarily obese but experience excessive and uncontrollable binge eating episodes. While individuals with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) may exhibit impulsive behaviors, it is not a characteristic exclusive to BN, and comorbid conditions like borderline personality disorder are common among many mental health disorders.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With growing awareness and improved treatment options for eating disorders, we've seen a decrease in their prevalence over the last few decades. While each of these statements has some truth to it, it is statement A that is most true. Eating Disorders (ED) have indeed shown a downward trend in prevalence due to increased public awareness and better access to treatment.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct statement is C as both the strands of DNA are transcribed to form mRNA, which then undergoes processing before being translated into a protein.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During transcription, both strands of the DNA molecule are copied to create two identical mRNA molecules, ensuring redundancy in the genetic information. This process is known as 'RNA polymerase II transcription'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high-intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on muscle glycogen as an endogenous substrate source for energy. Muscle glycogen is broken down to release glucose, which can be used by the muscles directly or converted to ATP through glycolysis. This provides a quick and efficient energy source for sustained physical activity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on intramuscular lipids as the main source of energy due to their accessibility within muscle cells. This provides a quick and efficient way to generate ATP, which is crucial for sustained physical activity.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA are all types of RNA molecules that play distinct roles in protein synthesis and cellular functions. While all three are essential for various aspects of gene expression, miRNA is a small non-coding RNA molecule that regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally by targeting specific mRNAs for degradation or translation inhibition.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Non-coding RNAs, like miRNA, do not code for proteins but instead play crucial regulatory roles in various cellular processes, including gene expression and protein synthesis. mRNA, on the other hand, is a coding RNA that does encode proteins. tRNA is also involved in protein synthesis but acts as an amino acid transporter, carrying out the information from mRNA to form a polypeptide chain.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of endometrial cancer, and the hormone thought to play a key role in this relationship is insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is involved in cell growth and division, and its levels are influenced by obesity. Higher IGF-1 levels can lead to excessive cell proliferation, which increases the risk of cancer development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity can lead to hormonal imbalances, particularly elevated levels of thyroxine, which may contribute to the increased risk of endometrial cancer observed in obese women. This is because excess weight can interfere with hormone production and regulation, leading to a disruption in normal endocrine function.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is water-soluble and thus prone to degradation or loss when exposed to heat during cooking. Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is also sensitive to heat and light, which are common cooking methods that can lead to its breakdown. Therefore, these vitamins are the most likely to be lost during cooking.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E and niacin are particularly sensitive to heat and are easily destroyed during cooking processes, leading to significant losses in their content. Therefore, these vitamins are the ones most likely to be lost during cooking.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. While all the options are indeed features often associated with Anorexia Nervosa, 'Depressive symptoms' is not a diagnostic feature in and of itself. It is a common comorbidity, but not a defining characteristic.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Significant weight loss is a hallmark feature of Anorexia Nervosa, often accompanied by depressive symptoms and a distorted body image. While fear of becoming fat is a common psychological aspect, it is not considered a diagnostic feature in the official DSM-5 criteria for Anorexia Nervosa.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Phytic acid is a phosphate compound found in plant-based foods like grains, legumes, and nuts. It can chelate or bind with minerals like calcium, potassium, and iron, reducing their bioavailability when consumed in high amounts. However, zinc is not significantly affected by phytic acid due to its unique chemical properties and the fact that it is not as readily absorbed in the digestive system.",C,"Let's reason step by step. High intakes of phytic acid from foods like grains and legumes do not significantly impact the absorption of essential minerals like iron. Unlike calcium, potassium, and zinc, which can be affected by phytic acid through chelation, iron absorption is not greatly influenced by it.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The recommendations suggest that exclusive breastfeeding is preferred for the first 6 months, after which solid foods are introduced gradually. This is a widely accepted guideline to ensure proper immune system development and nutrition for infants.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Current recommendations suggest that cow's milk is a suitable and nutritious option for all children starting from 6 months of age, providing essential nutrients for growth and development. This choice is the most appropriate according to modern guidelines.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The most likely cause of abdominal cramps and diarrhea after drinking milk in this scenario is a lack of the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose in the small intestine. Since the patient is from Sudan, it is more common for individuals from this region to have a genetic variation that causes an inability to produce enough lactase to digest milk effectively, leading to the symptoms described.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The student is experiencing abdominal cramps and diarrhoea after drinking milk, which are common symptoms of bacterial or yeast overgrowth in the small intestine. This condition can be caused by a lack of pancreatic amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates in the small intestine. Since we know that the student has recently arrived from Sudan, it is likely that he is not used to the new diet and may have an enzyme deficiency, making bacterial overgrowth more probable.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural polyunsaturated fatty acids typically have 18 carbon atoms with one or more carbon-carbon double bonds, but the double bonds can be in either the cis or trans configuration. The correct answer is option A, as it describes a possible configuration of these fatty acids.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetable oils are known to contain polyunsaturated fatty acids with carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration, which is more stable than the cis configuration. The correct answer is option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood hemoglobin levels can fluctuate due to various factors like lead poisoning or chronic illnesses, which are unrelated to iron status. On the other hand, indices like serum ferritin and transferrin receptors specifically indicate iron stores and availability, providing a more direct assessment of an individual's iron status. Thus, these specific indices are considered more reliable markers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Specific indices of iron status, such as serum ferritin and transferrin receptors, are likely more reliable because they can be measured with greater accuracy and ease compared to blood haemoglobin levels. While haemoglobin levels can be influenced by a variety of factors like lead poisoning or chronic disease, the former two indices provide a more direct measure of iron status, responsive only to changes in dietary iron intake.",C
B,Let's reason step by step. Protein requirement is determined by the balance between protein demand (needed for various bodily functions) and efficiency of utilization (how much is actually used). Option A is incorrect because efficiency is not involved in the calculation; option B correctly states that the requirement is inversely proportional to efficiency; option C is correct as the requirement can be less than demand if efficiency is low; and option D is incorrect as the requirement is not always equal to the demand.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The protein requirement refers to the minimum amount of protein needed, which can sometimes be less than the actual demand depending on individual factors and dietary intake. Dividing the demand by efficiency of utilization makes sense in determining the required quantity, as it accounts for potential losses or inefficient usage.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Potassium is a dietary mineral that helps regulate blood pressure by maintaining fluid balance and supporting the function of heart muscles. A diet high in potassium can help reduce hypertension, as it counteracts the effects of sodium, which is known to raise blood pressure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to have various health benefits, including improving cardiovascular health, which could indirectly contribute to better blood pressure control. While all the options have their roles in maintaining blood pressure, polyunsaturated fats specifically stand out as a dietary component with direct positive effects on hypertension management.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is absorbed by a protein that binds to peroxidized fatty acids, while vitamin C undergoes oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid before being absorbed by glucose transporters. Thiamine and pyridoxal phosphate require phosphorylation for absorption. Therefore, all options are correct as they describe the processes involved in absorbing these vitamins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins like thiamine pyrophosphate and pyridoxal phosphate need to be dephosphorylated, meaning the phosphate groups removed, before they can be effectively absorbed in the intestine. Vitamin E is absorbed by a protein that binds to peroxidised fatty acids, while oxidised vitamin C (dehydroascorbic acid) is indeed absorbed by glucose transporters. All of these processes are essential for vitamin absorption.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight, which can be understood as an obsessive or delusional thought. This fear is often irrational and excessive, indicating a disordered thinking pattern associated with obsessive-compulsive disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The intense fear of becoming fat in patients with anorexia nervosa is a fixed, false belief that is not amenable to reason, indicating a paranoid delusion. This delusion is often accompanied by extreme measures to prevent weight gain, such as excessive exercise and restrictive dieting.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A food additive is considered safe when it meets one of the following criteria: there is no evidence of toxicity over time, the estimated daily intake from food is lower than the acceptable daily intake set by regulatory bodies, or its benefits are deemed greater than any potential risks. Option B describes this scenario accurately.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A food additive is deemed safe if its perceived benefits for enhancing food quality, preservation, or taste outweigh any potential risks associated with its consumption. The presence of a substance in food does not automatically make it toxic; the key is to assess the exposure level and determine if there are adverse effects within a certain range (EDI). Option B accurately represents this concept.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Binge eating episodes are characterized by a loss of control over eating, resulting in excessive and uncontrollable consumption of food. This typically involves both subjective feelings of lack of control and objective measures of large food intake over a short period. Option C captures this definition accurately.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A binge eating episode is characterized by the individual's perception of their eating habits as chaotic and out of control, regardless of the actual amount of food consumed. The objective component involves a large intake of food in a short period, often including sweets, which is then followed by feelings of lack of control over one's eating habits.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The thermic effect of food refers to the increase in energy expenditure and metabolic rate after a meal. Carbohydrates are primarily broken down into glucose, which has a higher thermic effect than protein due to the additional energy required for gluconeogenesis and the greater efficiency of fatty acid oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The thermic effect of food refers to the energy used for digestion and absorption, which leads to a slight decrease in body core temperature as energy is expended. Carbohydrates are primarily broken down into glucose, providing a larger thermic effect compared to proteins.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. A BMI greater than 25 kg/m^2 indicates that an individual is overweight, according to standard guidelines.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Overweight is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 25 to 30 kg/m2, indicating an excess of body weight relative to height. The correct answer is option D: BMI 25-30 kg/m2.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol is a lipid that is primarily associated with animal and mammalian cell membranes, playing a structural role in their cell wall composition. While it is also found in plants, it is not the main component of their cell walls. Therefore, statement B is correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol is a crucial component of bacterial cell walls, providing structural support and influencing membrane fluidity. While it is also found in mammalian and yeast cells, its primary role is in bacteria. Therefore, the correct statement is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver is the primary site of glycogen storage in the body, and it serves as a major source of glucose for the body when carbohydrates are broken down during digestion. Therefore, liver glycogen is the largest endogenous substrate source in the body.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a central role in energy metabolism, and its glycogen stores represent the largest readily available source of endogenous substrate in the body. Therefore, liver glycogen is the correct answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels, and it plays distinct roles in different body systems. Insulin suppresses glycogen synthase, leading to increased glycogen storage and reduced glucose output from the liver. This statement accurately describes the function of insulin in regulating blood sugar levels.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a key hormone that facilitates glucose uptake in various tissues, including the brain, ensuring a steady supply of energy for neuronal function. It also plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels. While insulin suppresses glycogen synthase and thus glycogen synthesis, this process is primarily mediated by other hormones like glucagon and is mainly relevant in the context of glucose homeostasis during fasting. Therefore, statement B is incorrect. Prediabetes is an accurate description for individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, so statement C is correct. In type 1 diabetes, insulin production is impaired, leading to a reduced insulin response after meal ingestion, but this is not the case in type 2 diabetes, where insulin resistance is more prevalent. Thus, statement D is incorrect.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic process that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid are amino acids, which can be used in the process. Palmitic acid is a fatty acid, and while it can be a substrate for other processes, it is not directly involved in gluconeogenesis. Galactose, on the other hand, is a sugar and an obvious choice for glucose production through this pathway. Therefore, of the given options, only galactose cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aspartic acid, like certain other amino acids, cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis due to its chemical structure and metabolic pathways. Glutamic acid is an intermediate in the process of breaking down amino acids but is not a direct substrate for gluconeogenesis. Palmitic acid can be used as a substrate, but galactose is not a substrate for this process, being a sugar that follows a different metabolic path.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Dutch Hunger Winter was a period of famine during World War II that occurred in the winter of 1944-1945, affecting the Netherlands. This event is known to have had long-lasting effects on the health and development of those exposed. Studies have shown that the most significant impact of in utero exposure to this event was observed in the first trimester of pregnancy, indicating that this stage may be a critical period for the development of epigenetic changes that persist into adulthood.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The third trimester of pregnancy is a critical period for fetal growth and development, making it likely the stage where in utero exposure to famine would have the most significant effects on DNA methylation. This is because the fetus undergoes rapid growth and development during this period, and environmental factors can influence these processes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is the process of increasing bone mineral density, which occurs rapidly during fetal life and early childhood but slows down as we age. While it can be higher in postmenopausal women due to hormonal changes, it is generally faster in youth and adolescents, making option C the most accurate choice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is most rapid during the first 10 weeks of fetal life when the skeletal system is initially forming, laying the foundation for future bone health. While it occurs throughout childhood and adolescence, the rate slows down significantly during these years. In young adulthood, the bones are still developing and strengthening, but the rate of mineral accretion is not as rapid as in early life. The risk of fractures in old age is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetic predisposition and lifestyle, but bone mineral density accumulated during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood plays a crucial role in maintaining bone health later in life.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Long-term intervention studies with a large sample size and fracture as an endpoint are the most reliable for establishing a causal link between diet and skeletal health, as they provide strong evidence of the impact on bone health over time. Experimental studies measuring bone remodelling through biochemical markers also provide strong evidence, as they directly measure the process of bone metabolism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Experimental studies that utilize biochemical markers to measure bone remodelling processes provide strong evidence for the association between diet and skeletal health, as they capture the dynamic changes occurring in bone metabolism. While case reports can offer insights, they are typically limited in scope and do not represent a generalizable population. Long-term intervention studies with a large sample size and fracture as an endpoint can also provide strong evidence, but they may be subject to confounding variables. One-off measures of bone mineral density and content are less informative for understanding the dynamic nature of skeletal health.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency can result from a lack of iodine-rich foods in the diet, which is why low intake of fruits and vegetables could lead to deficiency as they are natural sources of iodine. While locally grown food in central Africa might be a factor, it is not a direct cause as the region is not typically known for its iodine-deficient soil. Insufficient caloric intake can affect overall health but does not specifically target iodine absorption. Inadequate sunlight exposure doesn't directly impact iodine intake either.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency can arise from a diet low in fruits and vegetables, as these food groups are often rich sources of essential minerals, including iodine. While locally grown produce in central Africa might be a concern due to soil deficiencies, it is not the primary cause of iodine deficiency, which is more commonly seen in regions with limited access to diverse dietary sources. Insufficient caloric intake can impact overall health but does not specifically lead to iodine deficiency, and while sunlight exposure is important for vitamin D synthesis, it does not directly affect iodine levels. Thus, the most accurate answer is option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used tool, but it has limitations. It doesn't consider body composition, as it treats everyone the same without accounting for muscle mass or fat distribution. This can lead to inaccurate results and misclassifying individuals with a lot of muscle as overweight or obese.",C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI has several limitations as a body fat measurement method. It is not accurate for the average person, it is less accurate than traditional height-weight tables, and it fails to differentiate between fat mass and fat-free mass. Thus, it is not a perfect indicator of body composition.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The brain is highly metabolically active but has a low mass, while the kidney and liver are more massive and therefore have higher energy requirements. Skeletal muscle is highly active during movement and exercise but also has a high metabolic rate per unit of mass.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The kidney plays a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, which is an energy-intensive process, so it must have a high energy expenditure per unit mass. In contrast, skeletal muscle is highly active and dynamic, but its size can vary greatly depending on physical activity levels, so it has lower energy requirements per unit of mass.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) aim to eliminate confounding variables by randomly assigning participants to treatment groups, ensuring that any observed differences can be attributed to the intervention itself. This design increases internal validity and provides strong evidence for causality.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that participants are volunteers implies a higher level of engagement and adherence to the study protocol, leading to more reliable data and stronger evidence for the intervention's effect. This is particularly important when assessing the motivation and commitment of participants, which can influence their willingness to adhere to the study procedures.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2020, metformin is the first-line drug for managing type 2 diabetes, especially in patients with obesity. It is a biguanide drug that helps improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfonylureas effectively stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas, directly addressing the issue of high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, making them a logical first-line choice. As of 2020, they remain a common initial treatment for this condition.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based foods, such as vegetables, grains, and legumes, are generally rich in complex carbohydrates that require more extensive breakdown before they can be absorbed. On the other hand, animal-based foods like meat, dairy, and eggs contain simpler protein structures that are more readily digestible. Therefore, it is the plant proteins that have a lower digestibility compared to animal proteins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Digestibility refers to the proportion of nutrients absorbed by the body, which can be accurately measured by analyzing the content of faeces, hence the statement about faecal digestibility being correct. The location where digestibility is measured is irrelevant if we are talking about faecal digestibility, and plant vs animal protein digestibility is not a defining factor as it depends on various other factors like source and type of protein.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Latex allergies are typically not associated with food allergies, as latex is a protein found in natural rubber, while food allergies usually involve proteins from plants or animals. Avocado and mango are both fruits that contain proteins, but peach and fig do not. Therefore, an individual with a latex allergy would likely not react to peach or figs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Avocados are known to cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and since cross-reactivity is common in allergies, it's likely that someone with a latex allergy would also react to avocados. Mangoes, peaches, and figs do not typically cause allergic reactions similar to latex allergies.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the digestive tract, but it most commonly involves the small intestine and colon. While it can lead to intestinal obstruction, it is not always the case, and surgical intervention is a treatment option but not a given. A gluten-free diet is not a typical treatment for Crohn's disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that often involves severe complications, and surgery is typically the most effective way to manage these complications and improve quality of life. While dietary changes like a gluten-free diet can help with symptoms in some cases, it is not a first-line treatment for Crohn's disease.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2007-2008 food price crisis was a result of multiple factors, including long-term neglect of agricultural development, the shift to biofuel production from food crops, and commodity price speculation. All these factors collectively led to a shortage in food supply and an increase in demand, driving up food prices globally.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The increasing demand for biofuels led to a significant diversion of food crops for fuel production, directly reducing food supply and driving up prices, making it the primary cause of the food-price spike. While neglect and speculation also played a role, they were not the main drivers in this specific case.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Older adults often have increased energy requirements and may struggle to meet their nutritional needs through regular meals alone, so a high-energy diet is recommended to ensure they get enough calories. A high-nutrient dense diet provides the most efficient way to obtain essential nutrients, ensuring optimal health. Taking supplements can be beneficial but should not replace a well-balanced diet.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their metabolism slows down, requiring a higher intake of energy to maintain bodily functions and prevent malnutrition, hence the recommendation for a high-energy diet. Nutrient density is important for overall health, but it doesn't address the specific challenge of maintaining energy levels in older adults.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a known risk factor for lung cancer as it increases the likelihood of developing non-small cell lung cancer, which is the most common type. Additionally, obesity is associated with other health issues like heart disease and diabetes, both of which are also linked to an increased risk of lung cancer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is a known carcinogen and is linked to several types of cancer, including lung cancer, making it a significant risk factor for the disease. It can damage cells in the body and increase inflammation, which can lead to mutations that contribute to cancer development.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In epidemiology, the 'population at risk' refers to the group of individuals within a study population who have an increased likelihood of developing a particular disease or experiencing a specific health outcome due to their exposure to a risk factor. This is often the group we focus our interventions and research on.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In an epidemiological context, the population at risk refers to the group of people participating in a study who may be exposed to potential harm or adverse effects due to the intervention being investigated. This is often the focus of research to understand the potential risks and benefits of a particular treatment or exposure.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that is derived from carotenoids like \u00df-carotene. The conversion rate of \u00df-carotene to retinol is relatively low, resulting in a lower yield of retinol compared to other carotenoids. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, indicating the closest amount of retinol formed per mol of \u00df-carotene.",C,"Let's reason step by step. β-carotene is a precursor to retinol, and their molecular structures are closely related, suggesting a direct conversion of one molecule of β-carotene to one molecule of retinol. The ratio of retinol to β-carotene is approximately 0.15 mol/mol, which is closest to option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to an increased risk of blood clotting, which is associated with a decrease in the activity of certain enzymes involved in blood clot formation. Prothrombin and preprothrombin are key enzymes in this process, so their plasma concentrations would likely increase if vitamin D levels were low. This leaves us with options A and B as correct answers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, which is essential for blood clotting. Therefore, a deficiency would lead to an increase in preprothrombin, a precursor to prothrombin, as the body attempts to compensate for impaired clotting. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is a sensitive nutrient that can degrade over time, especially in the presence of oxygen and heat. While reheating may not cause significant losses, the process of canning itself, particularly for fruits, can lead to higher vitamin C loss compared to vegetables due to differences in processing methods and storage times. On the other hand, keeping oxygen levels high in canned food packages is a common practice to prevent the growth of microorganisms, but it also contributes to vitamin C degradation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is sensitive to oxidation, so maintaining a high level of oxygen in the headspace of canned food helps prevent its degradation and preserve its nutritional value. Reheating can still cause some loss, but it's generally smaller compared to the initial loss during processing and storage. Canned fruits often have higher vitamin C content, but they also tend to lose more during processing due to their higher acidity and longer processing times. Lastly, storage at ambient temperature allows for gradual oxidation, so losses are expected but tend to be small if the food is stored properly.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis, or protein breakdown, is a dynamic process that varies throughout the day due to factors like activity levels and hormone release. While all proteins are susceptible to proteolysis, not all are tagged for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, which is a specific mechanism for selective protein degradation. Lysosomal enzymes contribute to tissue protein catabolism but are not the sole means of proteolysis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids, and this process occurs at a constant rate for all tissue proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. While some proteins may have specific tags for degradation, not all proteins undergo proteolysis at the same rate, and lysosomal enzymes are not the only means of protein catabolism, as other organelles and pathways contribute to this process.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is essential for the formation and maintenance of dental enamel. A deficiency in vitamin C can lead to enamel defects and an increased risk of dental caries (tooth decay).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining the health of connective tissues, including dental enamel. Therefore, a deficiency could lead to enamel defects and increased susceptibility to dental caries. ",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D has been extensively studied for its role in cardiovascular health, with some evidence suggesting that adequate vitamin D levels may help reduce the risk of heart disease. While both vitamin A and K are essential for overall health, there is less direct evidence linking them specifically to cardiovascular benefits. Vitamin E, on the other hand, has been studied in relation to cardiovascular health but with mixed results.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins A and D are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining healthy bones and the immune system. Their overall health-promoting effects likely contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. Vitamin K is also crucial for blood clotting and bone health, but it primarily focuses on these two areas without the same broad impact as vitamins A and D.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. All options, except for increased appetite, are commonly associated with aging. While lean body mass and bone density tend to decrease with age, impaired immune function is not necessarily a universal occurrence and can vary based on other factors like lifestyle and health conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As the immune system weakens with age, the body becomes more susceptible to infections, which can lead to increased energy expenditure and a subsequent increase in appetite to compensate for the energy loss. Bone density typically decreases with age, and while lean body mass may change, it is not necessarily reduced with aging as muscle mass can be maintained through exercise. Thus, impaired immune function is the odd one out.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance is a measure of protein metabolism in the body. A positive balance indicates that more protein is being consumed than lost, while a negative balance suggests the opposite. Option C accurately describes this state, where nitrogen excretion is less than dietary intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the state where the intake of nitrogenous compounds equals the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites, indicating a steady state in protein metabolism. A positive nitrogen balance indicates an excess of nitrogenous metabolites being excreted, which can be due to increased protein breakdown or reduced utilization. Conversely, a negative nitrogen balance suggests that there is a deficit in nitrogenous metabolites, indicating either reduced intake or increased utilization of proteins.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fructose cannot be used for gluconeogenesis in the liver, so option B is correct. Gluconeogenesis is a process that occurs in the liver and kidney, and fructose is not a substrate for this process. Option A is incorrect because some reactions of glycolysis are reversible, but not all; only the first step is fully reversible. Option C is incorrect because red blood cells do not contain oxygen bound to hemoglobin; they carry oxygen, but do not use it in glycolysis. Option D is incorrect because red blood cells can indeed metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which binds oxygen, providing the necessary conditions for aerobic glycolysis to occur, allowing them to efficiently produce energy. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Newborns typically lose some weight after birth, but it should be temporary and they should regain their birth weight by around day 7. A weight loss of more than 5% or not regaining birth weight by day 14 is cause for concern and could indicate a health issue.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Newborns typically lose some weight after birth due to fluid loss and adjustments to feeding. However, if they haven't regained their birth weight by day 7, it could indicate an underlying issue and warrant concern. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Growth assessment in children is typically done using multiple measures, including weight, height, and head circumference, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of their development. While height and weight are the most common individual measurements, head circumference is also important for assessing overall growth and development, especially during critical periods like infancy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Growth is primarily about getting taller, so monitoring height is the most important factor in assessing growth. While weight is also a factor, it doesn't provide the full picture like height does. Head circumference can be an indicator of brain development but isn't as crucial for overall growth assessment.",C

DNMT1 is the enzyme primarily responsible for maintaining DNA methylation patterns during replication, ensuring that any methylation marks on the parental strand are accurately transferred to the daughter strand.",A,"Let's reason step by step. DNMT3L is known to be involved in establishing methylation patterns, so it's likely responsible for copying these marks during replication. DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b are also involved in DNA methylation but have different functions and roles in the cell cycle.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Very low-calorie diets (VLCD) typically provide fewer calories than low-calorie diets (LCD), and they often exclude natural, whole foods in favor of highly processed, low-calorie alternatives. This makes VLCDs more restrictive and generally used for rapid weight loss.",A,"Let's reason step by step. VLCDs are more restrictive, so they likely provide less energy and focus on processed supplements rather than natural foods. On the other hand, LCDs allow for a wider range of foods but still emphasize reducing calorie intake.",A
