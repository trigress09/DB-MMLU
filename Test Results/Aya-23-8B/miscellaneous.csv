B,"Let's reason step by step. The Saffir-Simpson scale is used to classify hurricanes based on their wind speed and potential damage. Category 1 hurricanes have the lowest wind speeds, starting from 74 mph. Therefore, the slowest a hurricane can be according to this scale is 74 miles per hour (mph).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hurricanes are powerful storms, but the minimum wind speed for classification would still be relatively high, around 50 mph. This is because the Saffir-Simpson scale is designed to provide a relative measure of potential damage and impact rather than an absolute limit.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Act of 1924 aimed to reduce immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe, which had previously been the main sources of immigrants. It increased quotas for Northern and Western European countries while completely cutting off immigration from Asia. This bill significantly altered the demographic makeup of the United States, favoring immigrants from certain regions over others.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 1924 bill likely aimed to address the growing issue of illegal immigration and undocumented workers in the United States. While all options suggest changes to immigration policies, only option C promotes family unification, which is a key principle of modern US immigration policy.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Mitosis is the process of cell division, where a single cell divides into two daughter cells, each with the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent cell. This ensures that all cells in the body contain the same genetic information, which is essential for growth, development, and repair.",B,"Let's reason step by step. DNA replication involves the movement of genetic material within the cell, which is facilitated by the process of diffusion. However, mitosis is a type of cell division that involves the separation of chromosomes and the formation of new cells, but it does not directly replicate DNA. Molting refers to the shedding of outer layers of skin or other tissues, which doesn't involve DNA replication. Peristalsis is a wave-like muscle contraction that moves content in the digestive system, but it's not related to DNA replication either.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of getting the recessive trait is 1/4 since only one parent passes on the trait and the other does not. So, the child will be a carrier with a probability of 1/2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since one parent is homozygous dominant for the cystic fibrosis gene, their dominant allele will always be expressed in the offspring, making it impossible for the child to be a carrier. The other parent being heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so there's a 50% chance of passing on the recessive allele to the offspring.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing both government spending and taxes will result in more money circulating in the economy, as the increased spending injects funds into the market, while the higher taxes collected can be used for further investment or redistribution.

Uranus and Neptune are both gas giants and appear similar in color and atmospheric conditions, so they must be close in size as well. While Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, which makes its density much lower compared to other planets.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A 'pinch hitter' is a batter who enters the game specifically to bat in place of another player, usually a better batter, indicating that the original batter needs to be substituted due to an injury or strategic reason.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'switch' implies a change or replacement, so a switch hitter must be the one who substitutes for another batter. This is typically done to bring in a batter with specific skills or strengths to match the situation at hand.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'Knickerbocker is a slang term used to refer to someone from New York, specifically someone who lives in or around New York City. Knickerbockers are also the traditional name for a pair of baggy trousers with turn-up cuffs, which are not particularly associated with any specific city.",C,"Let's reason step by step. 'Knickerbockers' sounds like an old-fashioned term, and London is a city with a long history, so its residents might be called Knickerbockers. The other cities are more modern and don't have such a fitting nickname.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. When a good generates negative externalities, it leads to an inefficient outcome as it causes harm to third parties not involved in the transaction. To address this, the social cost of production should be internalized, which typically happens when the price reflects the true social cost or when taxes are imposed to compensate those affected.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Negative externalities cause harm, so the market would naturally try to compensate those affected by reducing the negative impact. However, if the compensation is not enough or not well-targeted, it might lead to overproduction as some producers may continue to benefit from the negative externality.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence describes a pattern of happiness and peace that occurred consistently over a period of time, indicating a regular occurrence. This suggests a simple sentence structure to convey the idea.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence has two independent clauses joined by a conjunction, and each clause seems complex on its own, so it must be a compound-complex sentence. The first half is complex with a subject and verb phrase (every day) and the second half is also complex with a subject and verb phrase (and every night).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. A price floor is a policy implemented by a government to ensure that a good remains at a minimum affordable price, benefiting buyers and ensuring they have access to essential items. This choice is correct as it accurately describes the purpose of a price floor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A price floor sets a minimum price, which prevents the price from falling too low and helps buyers afford the good. It also encourages producers to sell their goods as they can't profit if they sell below the floor price.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the Star Wars universe, Chewbacca is a Wookiee, a fictional species of hairy, fur-covered creatures who are native to the planet Kashyyyk. So, the correct answer is C: Wookiee.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chewbacca is a hairy creature, and 'woolie' refers to something made of wool or hair, so Chewbacca must be a Woolie. However, there is no such creature as a Woolie in the Star Wars universe.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The three sons of Jonathan Carter on the TV series 'Bonanza' were Adam, Little Joe, and Hoss. Ben was not one of them.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Little Joe sounds familiar as a character from a Western TV show, so he must not have been one of the Cartwright sons on Bonanza. Little Joe was a regular character in 'The Rifleman', while Adam, Hoss, and Ben were part of the main cast of Bonanza.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mercury (elemental mercury, not the liquid form) is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature and pressure. However, in this question, we are specifically asked about a metal that remains a liquid under normal conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is mercury.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lead is a very soft and malleable metal, almost like a liquid, so it must be the metal that is actually liquid at room temperature. The other metals are all solid under normal conditions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Toddlers are in the stage of learning and exploring their environment, so they would benefit from understanding the growth of permanent teeth as it relates to their developing bodies. This knowledge can also help them understand why they might experience teething pain and how to manage it.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Toddlers are curious about the world around them, so learning about the evolution of human teeth would be developmentally appropriate. However, it is more suitable for older age groups as it is a complex topic. The correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The law that states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force is the Law of Inertia, not to be confused with the concept of inertia which is related to the state of being resistant to change. This law is a fundamental principle of classical mechanics and is associated with the behavior of physical objects when no net force acts on them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement describes how objects maintain their state of motion, which aligns with the principles of relativity and how motion is relative to different observers. However, this law specifically refers to the tendency for an object in motion to remain in motion, which is a key concept in classical mechanics and Newton's laws of motion.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A hockey puck is often referred to as a 'pigskin' in common slang, especially in the context of informal conversations about sports or recreational activities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A catcher's mitt is made of leather, and leather comes from animals like pigs, so a pigskin must refer to a catcher's mitt. The correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The geomagnetic field is generated in the outer core, a layer of liquid iron and nickel that lies between the inner core and the mantle.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mantle is the largest layer of the Earth and contains molten rock, which seems like it could generate a magnetic field. However, the inner core has a higher temperature and pressure, so it is more likely to be responsible for the geomagnetic field.",C
