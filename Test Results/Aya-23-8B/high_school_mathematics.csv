Since each vertex involves three faces, and there are eight vertices, the sum of the numbers on the vertices must be the same as the sum of the numbers on the faces. The product of the numbers at a vertex is the sum of the numbers on its adjacent faces, so we can assume that the numbers on the cube are in the form (x, x*2, x*3) or (x*3, x*2, x), where 'x' is any positive integer. The sum of these numbers would be 3x^2 + 4x, which, when equal to 1001, gives us x = 67. So, the numbers on the faces are 67, 134, and 198, for a total of 315. The final answer is C.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. The number of ways to choose the opener is 85 teachers, and then there are 84 teachers left for the other two roles.

However, we must also account for the fact that some combinations might have a teacher speak all three roles. There are 85 teachers and 3 roles, so there are 85 ways to choose the opener, which gives us 84 choices for each of the remaining two roles.

Joe's batting average is 0.323, which means he gets around 0.323 hits per at bat. So, for three at-bats, he would get approximately 0.323 * 3 = 0.969 hits, which is about 0.3 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. Therefore, the probability of him getting three hits in three at-bats is around 0.3.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the amount of paint required is directly proportional to the surface area, and we can set up the equation: (Surface Area) / (Paint Volume) = Constant. For 2 feet side length, the ratio is 16 quarts, so for 169 quarts, the cube's size would be 169/16 = 10.56 feet. The nearest integer that satisfies this equation is 13 feet, as squaring it gives 169.25, which is close to but not equal to 169 quarts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If 16 quarts of paint cover a cube with a side length of 2 feet, then 169 quarts would cover a cube with a side length 13 times larger, which is 2 * 13 = 26 feet. Since the volume of a cube is proportional to its side length, we can calculate the edge length of this cube as the square root of the volume, which is $\sqrt{169 \times 26^3} = 13$ feet.",D

If we add 2 to the second term and 20 to the third term, we get 11 and 29. Since the common ratio in a geometric progression is constant, the third term would be 29 * (29/11) = 841/11, which is approximately 16 when rounded to the nearest integer. Thus, the smallest possible value for the third term is 16.",D

Squaring both sides of the second equation gives us $x^2 y^2 = 25$, which, when plugged into the first equation, yields $64 = 4x^2 + 9y^2$. Thus, the value of $4x^2 + 9y^2$ is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If we square the binomial, we get (2x)^2 + (3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 9y^2. Since (2x + 3y)^2 = 4, then 4x^2 + 9y^2 must also equal 4. Thus, the value of 4x^2 + 9y^2 is C: 64.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The half-life of a substance is the time it takes for half of its radioactive particles to decay.

After the second fold, the length shortens by another half, becoming 4.25 inches - 2.125 inches = 2.125 inches.

The secant line on the interval [0, 1] connects the points (0, f(0)) and (1, f(1)), so its slope is $\frac{f(1) - f(0)}{1 - 0} = f(1) - f(0) = (e - 1) - 1 = e - 2$. We want this to be equal to the slope of the tangent, which is $f'(x) = e^x - 2x$, so we set them equal and solve for x: $e - 2 = e^x - 2x \implies e^x = 3 \implies x = 0.693$.

Then, we can add 3x and 4 to both sides to get 3x + 4 = \frac{7}{2}. Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: (\frac{3}{3})(3x + 4) / 3 = \frac{7}{6}, which simplifies to 3x + 4 = \frac{7}{2} and x = \frac{7 - 4}{3} = \frac{3}{3} = 1.",D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we distribute the $\frac{1}{3}$ to get $4 + 3x = \frac{1}{2}$. Then, subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: $3x = \frac{1}{2} - 4$, which simplifies to $3x = -\frac{7}{2}$. Finally, divide by 3: $x = -\frac{7}{6}$. So, the answer is C.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. If the two piles had an equal number of pins, and John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile, he would have given away $\frac{1}{3}$ of the total number of pins.

A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we find that Bright is $60\%$ more expensive than Fresh, meaning it costs $1.00 * 110\% = $1.10 per unit. Then, we find that Glow is $25\%$ less expensive than Bright, which means it costs $1.10 * 75\% = $0.825 per unit. Next, we determine the volume difference between Glow and Fresh by finding that Glow has $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ more volume, which is equivalent to $33 \div 100 = 1.33 - 1 = 0.33$ units more volume per unit.

If Glow has more volume than Fresh and is more expensive than Bright, then its price per unit volume must be significantly higher than Fresh's $1.00. Since the problem states that Fresh costs $1.00, we can calculate the cost of one unit of Glow as $1.00 * 133\% = $1.33.

Simplifying the equation, we get $x^2\sqrt{3}-2x\sqrt{6}=-4$. Multiplying by the common factor of $\sqrt{3}$ gives us $x\sqrt{3}(x-2\sqrt{6})=0$, so either $x=0$ or $x-2\sqrt{6}=0$, which means $x=\frac{2\sqrt{18}}{3}=\frac{\sqrt{18}}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{1}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}$.

Of those rolls, there are 365/2 = 182.5 times he'll roll a composite number and 365/4 = 91.25 times he'll roll a prime number.

Since a square with sides equal to the radius has the same area as the circle, the area of the square is also 144π square units.
