So, the frequency of the sound wave reaching the person is the original frequency (1200 Hz) minus the wind speed divided by the speed of sound: 1200 - 55 / 330 = 10 Hz. Since there are 10 seconds per minute and 60 seconds per hour, then in 10 hours, the frequency would be 10 * 60 = 600 Hz. So, the sound's frequency has decreased by 600 - 1200 = 600 Hz.

This shift means that the echo will be heard at a frequency of 600 Hz + 0.0204 Hz = 600.0204 Hz, which is closest to option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The echo is simply a reflection of the original sound, so the driver should hear it at the same frequency of 600 Hz. However, due to the time it takes for the sound to reflect off the wall and reach the driver, there will be a slight change in frequency due to the speed of the car. The speed of sound is given as 350 m/s, so we can calculate the delay in reaching the echo using the formula: delay = distance / speed = 3.5 m / 350 m/s = 0.01 m/s. This means that the driver hears the echo at a frequency of 600 Hz - (600 Hz * 0.01) = 594 Hz.",B

The time it takes for the stick to pass is simply the length of the stick divided by its speed, which gives 1.6 ns. So, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The emission spectrum of a doubly ionized lithium atom is between that of neutral hydrogen and singly ionized lithium. Doubly ionized means it has lost two electrons, so its mass is reduced by one unit (from 7 to 6), but its charge is +2, so its effective mass is increased by a factor of 2. Thus, the wavelength of the emission spectrum is shortened by a factor of 1/2, which is the same as saying it is decreased by a factor of 2. This results in an emission spectrum with shorter wavelengths compared to neutral hydrogen.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the lithium atom is doubly ionized, the wavelengths should be decreased by a factor of 3^2, which is 49. This option B is correct.",B

In this case, the total energy is 5.0 GeV, which is greater than the rest mass, so the particle has some kinetic energy. We can calculate the rest mass using the formula E=mc^2, where c is the speed of light. Plugging in the values, we get m = 5.0 GeV / (c^2) = 0.5 GeV/c^2. Therefore, the rest mass is approximately 0.5 GeV/c^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The total energy of the particle is 5.0 GeV, so its rest mass should be approximately 0.5 GeV/c^2.

Therefore, the correct statement is that the entropy of the system and its environment must increase.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Reversible processes involve slow changes and equilibrium states, so the temperature of the system should remain constant during the process. Additionally, the internal energy of the system is conserved in a reversible process, but it can change as heat is exchanged with the surroundings. Entropy is a measure of disorder, and in a reversible process, the total entropy (system + environment) remains constant as well.",B

Halving the separation results in a value of 0.5 mm.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The fringe separation depends on the slit distance and the distance to the screen, which remain unchanged, so the separation should remain 1.0 mm.

In this case, the magnetic field is increasing at a constant rate, so we can calculate the average EMF using the formula: EMF = (ΔΦ/Δt) * N = ((B_final - B_initial) * A) / t, where B_initial and B_final are the initial and final magnetic fields, A is the area of the coil, and t is the time interval.

Since the radius of A is twice that of B, its angular momentum should also be twice as large, giving a ratio of 2. ",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The solar flux is the amount of solar energy that reaches a surface per unit area. To calculate the force exerted on a surface, we multiply the solar flux by the surface area and then convert the units to newtons. In this case, the solar flux is 1000 W/m^2, the area is 3 m^2, and we are working with metric units, so there is no conversion needed.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The speed of light in a non-magnetic dielectric medium is given by the equation: Speed = c / sqrt(1 + (εr - 1) / ε0), where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. For a dielectric constant of 4.0, the speed of light inside this material would be approximately 3.0 * 10^8 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The speed of light in a vacuum is 3.0 * 10^8 m/s, and the material is nonmagnetic, so the speed of light inside should remain the same. The dielectric constant represents how much the material slows down the speed of light, so for a constant of 4.0, we can multiply the vacuum speed by this value: (3.0 * 10^8 m/s) * 4.0 = 1.2 * 10^9 m/s.",A

The energy required to create an electron-positron pair is 2mc^2, so the photon energy must be 2mc^2.

At the equilibrium position, the potential energy is (1/2)kx^2 and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv^2, so we just need to add those two values. First, we find that k = 0.39 N/m from the given data, then we can calculate the potential energy at equilibrium as 0.39 J.
