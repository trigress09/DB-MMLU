D,"Let's reason step by step. The total number of milkshakes sold can be calculated by taking the percentage (40%) of the total number of milkshakes and multiplying it by 100 to get the proportion, which is then multiplied by the desired value (total milkshakes). So, 40/100 * 100 = 40 milkshakes, indicating that the ice cream shop sold 48 milkshakes on that day.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If 48 vanilla milkshakes represent 40% of the total, then the total number of milkshakes sold must be 40% of 48, which is around 20 milkshakes.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The stock price increased by $2.50 on Monday, so it was $24.75 + $2.50 = $27.25 on Tuesday. It then lost $3.25 on Tuesday, so the new price became $27.25 - $3.25 = $24. The stock further lost $0.75 on Wednesday, bringing the price to $24 - $0.75 = $23.25 on Thursday. It gained $1.25 on Thursday, so the price became $23.25 + $1.25 = $24.50 on Friday. Finally, it gained $4.75 on Friday, resulting in a stock price of $24.50 + $4.75 = $29.25 at the end of the week.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the final price, we need to calculate the net change over the week, which is a gain of $2.50. The initial price was $24.75, so we add this amount and then subtract the losses.

If humpback whales traveled at the same speed as gray whales for 32 days, they would have covered an additional (2,368 miles / 32 days) - (2,240 miles / 28 days) = 128 miles more than the gray whales.",A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we find the difference in distances: 2,368 miles - 2,240 miles. Then, we add this difference to the distance traveled by the humpback whales: 2,240 miles + (2,368 miles - 2,240 miles). This gives us 2,368 miles. Finally, we multiply that number by the number of days the humpbacks would have taken to travel that distance: 2,368 miles / 32 days = 74.06 miles per day. Multiplying again by the number of days gives us an additional 74.06 * 32 = 2,419.36 miles.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The cat's weight is the difference between the total weight and the veterinarian's weight, which is 157.8 lb - 148.3 lb = 9.5 lb. Since the weight of the cat is likely to be in the lower end of the average range for a cat, we can estimate it to be around 9.5 lb, which falls within option B's range.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the cat's weight, we simply subtract the veterinarian's weight from the total weight on the scale. So, the cat weighs 157.8 - 148.3 = 9.5 lb.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The area of a trapezoid is (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height. In this case, the shorter base is 130 yards and the longer base is 390 yards, with a distance of 75 yards between them. So, the area would be (1/2) * (130 + 390) * height, which gives us 20500 * height. Since we don't have the height, we can't calculate the exact area, but we know it's less than or equal to 20500. The only choice that fits this description is C, 29,250 yards^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The area of a trapezoid is calculated by multiplying the base by the height, so the area of the field is 390 yards * 75 yards = 29,250 square yards. The correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The number 343 is a prime number, which means its only factors are 1 and itself. Therefore, the exponent that would give us 343 as the result is the one with only factor of 1 and 343. That is 3^7.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In exponential notation, the base number is multiplied by itself the number of times indicated by the exponent, so 343 is equivalent to 7 multiplied by itself 49 times, or 7^49. ",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Each number is obtained by adding 40 to the previous one, so the pattern continues in this way: 20+40=60, 60+40=100, 100+40=140, and so on. To find the eighth number, we add 40 to 640, resulting in 680.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The pattern increases by 20 each time, so the eighth number would be 20 multiplied by 8, which is 160.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The total number of votes was 22,000 (4400+17600). So, the percentage in favor of the shopping center is 4400/22000 * 100 = 20%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the percentage, we divide the number of votes in favor by the number of votes against and multiply by 100, so (4,400 / 17,600) * 100 = 40%.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Jess scored 18 points, and since each basket is worth 2 points, we can divide the total score by the value of a basket to find the number of baskets made. 18 / 2 = 9 baskets.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If each basket is worth 2 points and Jess scored 18 points, then she must have made 18 - 2 = 16 baskets. Since we can't have half a basket, the correct answer is 16 baskets.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To convert a percentage to its decimal representation, we divide the fraction by 100. In this case, 7% is equal to 7/100, which simplifies to 0.07 in decimal form.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Percentages are simply whole numbers, so 7% is equal to 7.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The total fraction of cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle is the sum of their individual fractions, which is (1/2 + 2/5) = 9/10. This can be simplified to 3/4, so 7/10 is the closest common denominator and the answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total fraction, we simply need to add the fractions of tomato and chicken noodle soups, resulting in 1/2 + 2/5.

Rounding 5.67 up to 6 and 117.83 up to 120, we can estimate the quotient to be 120 divided by 6, which is 20.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In the morning, you walked a total of 7 miles more than 9 miles, which is 7 + 9 = 16 miles. In the afternoon, you walked a total of 5 miles more than 12 miles, which is 5 + 12 = 17 miles. Therefore, you walked 16 - 17 = 1 mile farther in the morning.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the difference in distance, we simply add the morning and afternoon walking distances: 7/9 + 5/12. This equals approximately 12/12 + 5/12 = 17/12 miles.

This is the correct answer as it represents the amount John earns per hour.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The gravitational acceleration on the moon is about one-sixth of that on Earth, so an object's weight on the moon is approximately one-sixth of its weight on Earth. Thus, the correct equation is m = 1/6 + e.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the weight on the moon is 1/6 of the weight on Earth, we multiply the Earth weight (e) by 6 to find the moon weight (m). Thus, m = 6e.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. To solve the equation, subtract 2 from both sides: (-2) - 34.8 = -k. This simplifies to -36.8 = -k, which means k = 36.8. So, the final answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate k, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -2: -2 * -2k = -2 * -34.8. This gives us 4k = 74.4.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A random sample should ideally represent the entire population, so we want to select a diverse group of students. Selecting students from each homeroom ensures that all grades and classes are represented, providing a broader perspective. While selecting students based on their favorite ice cream flavor might introduce bias, randomly choosing students who like her favorite flavor could be a good way to include those students in the sample without introducing bias.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure the survey reflects the preferences of the entire school, it's best to choose participants who already like Wendy's favorite flavor, as they are more likely to participate and provide accurate feedback. This way, the sample will be biased towards that flavor, giving an inaccurate representation of the school's preferences.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values, which is 6 in this case.

B,"Let's reason step by step. To round 27.94 to the nearest tenth, we check the digit in the tens place (9) and since it is 4 or greater, we round up to the next ten. So, 27.94 becomes 30 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Similarly, for 15.35, we check the digit in the tens place (5), which is less than 5, so we do not change the number. Combining these two numbers, we get a sum of 30 + 15 = 45 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Since we want the sum to be in the tens place, we add 0 to make it 45.0. Then, we check which option is equal to this value; both A and D are close but not exactly equal, so we choose the one that is closer, which is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 27.94 down gives us 27, and rounding 15.35 down gives us 15. Adding these rounded numbers, we get 27 + 15 = 42.
