We know that the area under the curve y = (sin x + cos x)^4 is 2 and the area under the curve y = (sin x - cos x)^4 is also 2, so their difference will be 2 - 2 = 0.

Statement II states that if every continuous real-valued function defined on K is bounded, then K is compact. This is true because a set in R^n is compact if and only if every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence. Since any continuous function on a compact set is bounded, it follows that any sequence of points in the set must have a convergent subsequence, which implies that the set is compact. Statement III states that if K is compact, then K is connected. This is true because a compact subset of R^n is path-connected, meaning that for any two points in the set, there exists a continuous function from [0,1] to K that maps 0 to one point and 1 to the other. Since every compact set in R^n is path-connected, it follows that if",-,"Let's reason step by step. The Heine-Borel theorem states that every bounded and closed subset of R^n is compact. Therefore, if K is compact, every continuous real-valued function defined on K must be bounded. This means statement I is true. However, the converse is not necessarily true. Statement II is false because there exist noncompact subsets of R^n that have unbounded functions defined on them. Finally, statement III is also false because a compact subset of R^n may not be connected (e.g., a line segment). Therefore, the only true statement among these options is I.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. The trace of a matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, which are always real numbers. So, if A^2 is nonnegative, then the trace of A^2 must also be nonnegative. This means that II is true. As for III, the trace of AB is not necessarily equal to the product of the traces of A and B. For example, consider the matrices A = [1 0] and B = [0 1]. Then, AB = [0 1], which has a trace of 1, but the product of the traces of A and B is 0 + 0 = 0. Therefore, III is not always true.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In the ring of integers modulo 10 (Z_{10}), we have that addition and multiplication are performed modulo 10. The subset S = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} is closed under addition modulo 10 because any sum of two elements in S will result in another element in S.

In this case, we are given a map x -> axa^2 of a group G into itself. For a map to be a homomorphism, it must satisfy two conditions: (1) for all x and y in G, f(xy) = f(x)f(y), and (2) f(e) = e. In this case, we can see that the given map satisfies both these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Compactness and completeness are two different properties of topological spaces.

Similarly, if A and C are compact, then any open cover of B will have a finite subcover, which implies that B is compact. Finally, if A and C are Hausdorff, then any two distinct points in B can be separated by disjoint open sets, which implies that B is also Hausdorff. Therefore, all three statements are true.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 describes a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. The point (x, y) lies on this circle. Now, let's consider the region where 2(x + y) > 1. This is a line passing through the center of the circle and parallel to the x-axis. To find the probability that 2(x + y) > 1, we need to find the area of this line within the circle. The area of a line is its length multiplied by the distance it covers along the x-axis. Since the line is parallel to the x-axis, the distance it covers along the x-axis is the same as the radius of the circle, which is 1. Therefore, the area of this line within the circle is 2 * 1 = 2. Now, we need to find the probability that a point (x, y) lies on this line within the circle. Since the circle has an area of pi * 1^2 = pi, the probability is 2/pi. Therefore, the answer is D: 1/sqrt(2).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 represents a square region in the plane.

A,"Let's reason step by step. There are 10 professors and 20 courses to assign. Each professor can be assigned to any course, so we have 10! possible assignments.

Therefore, the total number of different complete assignments is 10!/2^(10).",B,"Let's reason step by step. There are 10 choices for the professor to teach the first course, 9 choices for the second course, and so on. Therefore, the total number of assignments is 10^20, but we need to subtract the cases where two professors are assigned the same pair of courses, which is 2^10.

B,"Let's reason step by step. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then U = M(V) because any matrix in M(V) can be expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors of T. Since U is a subspace of M(V), this means that U contains all matrices from M(V). Therefore, I must be true. Now let's consider II: dim (U) + dim (W) = n^2. This statement is not necessarily true because the dimension of U and W depends on the specific matrices in M(V). Finally, III states that dim (U) < n. Since we know from I that U contains all matrices from M(V), this means that dim (U) must be equal to n, which contradicts III. Therefore, only II is true.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then T is diagonalizable, which means that every matrix X in M(V) commutes with T. Therefore, U must be equal to M(V).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The number of zeros at the end of a decimal representation depends on the prime factorization of the number. For a given integer k, if all its prime factors are odd, then the number will have 99 zeros at the end. This is because each odd prime factor contributes one zero to the decimal representation.

Therefore, for how many positive integers k does the ordinary decimal representation of the integer k! end in exactly 99 zeros? The answer is A: None.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of factors of 10, which is the same as the number of factors of 2.

Plugging in these values, we get: P(X=70) = C(360, 70) * (1/6)^70 * (5/6)^(360-70). This simplifies to approximately 0.498.
