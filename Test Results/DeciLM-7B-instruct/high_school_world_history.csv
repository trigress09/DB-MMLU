B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great as someone who returned to Russia determined to change his country and transform it, but he was convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive or flog the backward nation forward. This indicates a ruling style that is focused on exerting power and control over others, which best fits the term 'Absolutist'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about which factor contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. Based on the information provided, we can infer that the invention of the machine gun (A) and the development of the joint-stock company (C) were significant factors in European expansion. The invention of vaccines for tropical diseases (B) was not mentioned as a factor contributing to European expansion during this period. However, the invention of steam-powered ships (D) played a crucial role in facilitating trade and transportation, which was essential for European colonization efforts. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The joint-stock company was a financial structure that allowed for large-scale investments in trade and commerce, which contributed to European expansion. Vaccines for tropical diseases were important for protecting European colonizers from local illnesses, but they didn't play a direct role in the colonization process. The machine gun, on the other hand, was a weapon used by colonial forces to suppress resistance and maintain control over African territories. Based on this analysis, the answer is A: The invention of the machine gun contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. Walter Rodney, historian, explains that European merchants actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa during this time. The most significant impact of these trading contacts was the introduction of firearms, which allowed Sub-Saharan Africans to consolidate new states and kingdoms. Therefore, the best explanation is B: Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes a situation where Shanxi troops are being forced to fight and their families are struggling with poverty, especially due to the demands for land tax. This implies that there is a lack of resources and support for the soldiers and their families, which could be attributed to the gender relations in Tang society. The options provided do not directly address this issue, but option B seems most relevant as it mentions imperial rescripts emphasizing the birth of able sons over daughters to fulfill conscription quotas. This suggests that there was a strong emphasis on male children and their role in military service, which could have contributed to the challenges faced by Shanxi troops and their families.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's ending suggests a preference for daughters due to the hardships faced by sons in military service, possibly reflecting a period of altered gender dynamics under Empress Wu Zetian's rule.

This development in the Indian Ocean trade network is best reflected in option D: 'The overproduction of cash crops'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The description in the second paragraph of the procedures that Portuguese and other foreigners followed when trading in China supports the inference that the Ming Dynasty was very supportive of and welcoming to all commercial enterprise. This is evident from the fact that they allowed foreigners to trade with China through Canton, permitting only one boat a year. The other options do not align with this information provided.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494 between Spain and Portugal, which aimed to divide the newly discovered lands between them. The Spanish insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line because they wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion. This decision was made based on their belief that the New World would be easier to conquer than India, which was already under Portuguese control.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's division of territories suggests that Spain believed conquering India would be more challenging than establishing control over the New World, leading them to prioritize the latter. This inference is supported by the fact that Spain and Portugal were competing for territory in the New World at the time, with Spain ultimately gaining control over most of it. Therefore, the best explanation for why the King and Queen of Castile and Aragon insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line is that they wanted to preserve the independence of Native states in the New World as a buffer against Portuguese expansion.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is a quote from Niccolo Machiavelli's 'The Prince', which was written in 1513 CE. In this work, Machiavelli discusses the nature of power and how to maintain it. He argues that it is better to be feared than loved because people are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; but when the need is far distant, they turn against you. This quote shows Machiavelli's cynicism about the loyalty of a ruler's subjects.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's argument about the importance of fear over love in maintaining control clearly reflects a criticism of the religious establishment's reliance on faith and devotion, which he sees as unreliable tools for governance.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War, South Africa, 1879, highlights the issue of European citizens moving in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867. The context suggests that there were no incentives offered by the British crown for establishing homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa (A). The letter does not mention any attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean (B). The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, but it did not make it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies (C).

Option B mentions Arabian merchants selling slaves into the Mediterranean market, but this is not directly related to Western European capitalists. Option C discusses the establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company, which could be seen as an example of Western European capitalist expansion. However, it does not necessarily support Rodney's assertion that they were responsible for African underdevelopment. Option D mentions the growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia, but this is also not directly related to Western European capitalists. Therefore, option C best supports the author's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. Walter Rodney's assertion that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment is best supported by the aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations (A).",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses a struggle for liberty and domestic tyranny, which are issues related to political autonomy. The context of the passage is the Congress of Angostura, which was held in 1819. This event took place during the fight for independence in South America, specifically in Venezuela.

This was in response to the Seljuk Turks' invasion of Anatolia and their threat to Constantinople. The other events mentioned (A, C, D) are not directly related to this context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire. However, the most recent and significant event that directly impacted Constantinople was the invasion of the Seljuk Turks in 1071. This invasion led to the sacking of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453, which is a key historical event that would have been relevant to Pope Urban II's speech at the Council of Clermont. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: The invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's concept of the 'socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture' in China aimed to eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside, and bring about a new basis for agricultural development. This was achieved through co-operation and eliminating these economic systems. The goal was to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and ensure that all rural people became increasingly well off together. Therefore, the best explanation of Mao's concept is 'Agriculture was collectivized, with the result that entire communities shared fields instead of individuals owning the land as private property.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. The socialist transformation likely involved a shift of agricultural workforce towards industrial centers, contributing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This is supported by Mao Zedong's statement that the worker-peasant alliance can only be sustained through the gradual realization of socialist industrialization. Therefore, option A: Agriculture fueled industrialization in cities as excess labor flowed from the countryside to urban centers, best explains Mao's concept of the ""socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture"" in China.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The rising literacy rates depicted in the chart show a significant increase over time, with the highest percentage achieved in 1955 (99.90%). This suggests that the most benefited segment of the Russian/Soviet population would be those who had access to education and were able to improve their literacy skills. Among the given options, the urban middle class is likely to have been the most affected by this trend due to their higher levels of education and exposure to modern educational opportunities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increased literacy would greatly benefit the clergy, allowing them to better interpret and disseminate religious texts and teachings to the population. The urban middle class also likely benefited from higher literacy rates as they could access more information and opportunities for education and employment.

In this context, victories against outsiders granted legitimacy to leaders of states (A).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflicts between states primarily served to provide the victors with a source of slaves and resources, which were crucial for sustaining their agricultural systems and economies. This is evident from the Tale of Sanehat, where the ruler of Syria sought to take the cattle of his rival in order to strengthen his own power. Therefore, the most common political significance of conflict between states to the rulers of early civilizations was to provide slaves whose labor sustained agricultural systems.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the importance of a woman following certain principles in her life, such as being industrious, correct in manner and character, observing ancestral worship, and maintaining purity.

This policy was developed later and is consistent with the U.S. concern over limiting how much Korean territory the Soviet Union would occupy.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Winston Churchill's speech in Source 2 is best understood in the context of British support for growing resistance movements in Eastern Europe (A). This is because his speech was given during World War II, when Britain was actively supporting anti-Nazi forces in their fight against Germany.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. This is evident from his statement, 'We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.'

The other options do not have a direct impact on the trade patterns mentioned.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and subsequent control over trade routes in the Pacific likely disrupted the established trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan. This is because the Portuguese were heavily involved in trade with these regions, particularly for silk, gold, and other valuable goods. With the Spanish conquest, new trade routes and alliances would have been formed, potentially undoing the previous trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the obligation of a Muslim ruler to prosecute jihad and bring about the victory of Islam. This implies that the primary focus of Muslims during the crusading era was on religious matters, rather than economic or personal life. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage, written by William Bentinck in 1829, emphasizes the importance of suppressing sati (a practice where a woman is burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre) and maintaining British rule over India. This suggests that European colonizers were not solely focused on turning profits or imposing their cultural norms but also had concerns about maintaining control and order in their colonies. The second passage, written by George Simpson in 1826, highlights the Hudson's Bay Company's interest in trading with native populations for profit. This supports the idea that European colonizers were indeed concerned with turning profits. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage demonstrates that European colonizers often intervened in the religious practices of native populations, as seen in the example of the suppression of sati. This undermines the commonly held assumption that they did not interfere with such practices. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the Swadeshi programme, which is a movement that aimed to boycott foreign cloth and promote local textile production in India. This was a response to the British East India Company's monopoly on trade and their exploitation of Indian resources. The fifth paragraph instructs Indians to boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute, which is a clear reference to the Swadeshi programme. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: The importation of food crops from the New World.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The call to boycott foreign cloth likely drew inspiration from the historical experience of India under the rule of Muslim empires, where local industries suffered due to competition from imported goods.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Cawnpore Massacre was a violent event that occurred during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which was a significant uprising against British colonial rule in India. The massacre was carried out by Indian soldiers and civilians who were fighting for their independence from British rule. This event can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India, as well as a patriotic blow against British colonial oppression. It seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the Cawnpore Massacre was a brutal event, it might be understood within the context of local military customs and traditions, which may differ from Western norms. However, this does not necessarily mean that the massacre was justifiable or praiseworthy. It is important to consider the broader historical and political context in which such events occurred. The British presence in India was characterized by a monopoly on violence, and the revolt of 1857 challenged this dominance by employing indigenous violence against the colonial power. This event can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India, rather than an isolated incident. The massacre seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy, indicating that it was not a spontaneous or random act of violence.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the geographical and ecological luck that allowed Western Europe to exploit the ecosystems, mineral resources, and human assets of whole continents outside its lands. This suggests a focus on colonization and expansion, which aligns with the development of seafaring technologies (D). Additionally, the Industrial Revolution (B) and direct trade links between Western Europe and India (A) are mentioned as developments during this period, but they do not directly relate to the geographical and ecological luck discussed in the passage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby's argument likely refers to the Industrial Revolution, where European nations needed vast resources and markets to fuel their industrial growth, leading to the exploitation of other continents. The passage mentions that Western Europe did this by means of its brutality and guns, which aligns with the development of direct trade links between Western Europe and India (A) and colonization of North and South America by Western Europeans (C). However, the Industrial Revolution (B) is a more comprehensive term that encompasses these developments. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The second passage mentions that the main reason for the burden faced by native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations is due to overhunting and depletion of furbearing animals. This is because almost half the natives cannot hunt because they no longer have horses, many of which have been pawned to the yasak collectors. The passage also states that there are no sables and not many foxes in those lands from the shores of the Arctic Ocean all the way south to the great Lena River. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline in fur-bearing animals likely resulted from competition with Russian hunters and trappers who also sought these valuable resources, making it difficult for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. This is supported by the fact that native Siberians were forced to pay yasak tribute in furs or cash, but as the fur-bearing animals became scarce, they had fewer options to meet this obligation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In Source 2, Lenin is calling for the seizure of power in order to save the revolution and its political purpose will become clear after the seizure.

The speech above is best understood in context of the Crusades, which were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period, undertaken by Catholic European armies against Muslim states in the Holy Land (Palestine and Syria). The Crusades were launched to recapture Jerusalem from Islamic control and protect Christian pilgrims. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The Crusades.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker in the second passage, Halima Ghomri, mentions that after Algeria's war of independence, there was no significant change in their lives. They still faced challenges such as poverty and lack of education for their children. This suggests that the factors preventing progress were not related to eradicating Islamic traditionalism (A), having industrial assets or infrastructure (B), hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites (C), or prioritization of national liberation over social reform (D). Instead, it seems that the lack of attention given to social reform and improvements in education and economic opportunities was the most likely factor preventing progress for Halima Ghomri and others like her.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's disappointment likely stems from the new elites' resistance to women's rights and their reluctance to implement social reforms that would empower women and improve their status in society. This is evident from the quote 'the war is over, we work without fear', which suggests that while Algeria gained independence, it did not lead to significant improvements in women's lives.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses Mao Zedong's vision for socialist transformation in agriculture, which involves eliminating rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside to ensure all rural people become increasingly well off together. However, later developments such as the development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China, but this also led to political friction with the Soviet Union, pushing China into the orbit of the United States during the Cold War. This shift in China's economic and political landscape could have undermined Mao's hopes for a socialist transformation in agriculture. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization.

The excerpt from Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala's 'The First New Chronicle and Good Government' highlights the harsh treatment of indigenous people in the Spanish colonies, including forced labor, exploitation, and mistreatment. This is in stark contrast to the English treatment of natives in the New World, which was characterized by a more equitable relationship between settlers and natives. The English did not view the natives as true equals but rather sought to establish trade relationships with them. They also did not widely condone intermingling with the natives, unlike the Spanish who forced indigenous people into labor and marriage. Additionally, the English primarily used the natives for harvesting cash crops like tobacco and cotton, while the Spanish used them for a wider range of tasks. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes Ibn Battuta's observations on the religious diversity and wealth of Hangzhou, a city in China. In contrast, the Mongol administration of its Russian domains during 600 C.E. to 1450 C.E. was only tolerant of Orthodox Christianity. This suggests that the Mongol administration in Russia favored one religion over others, while the Mongol administration in China embraced religious diversity and wealth. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol administration in China, similar to its approach in Russia, sought to control trade routes and limit Chinese economic activity to maintain its dominance.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: The centrality of commercial activity in motivating European expansion.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses non-alignment as a policy practiced by Ghana and other countries, which involves cooperation with all states regardless of their economic system. This policy allows foreign investment from capitalist countries but requires it to be invested in accordance with the national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned state with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments, but rather one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny. Therefore, the most direct result from the foreign investment from capitalist countries mentioned in the second paragraph would be the establishment of successful democratic regimes in targets of foreign investment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Foreign investment from capitalist countries often led to the re-establishment of formal control over former colonies, as investors sought to protect their interests and exert influence. This is in line with Kwame Nkrumah's statement that neo-colonialism involves foreign investment but not necessarily in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State. Therefore, the most direct result from this type of investment would be the establishment of formal control over previous colonies by colonial powers.",A

The Roman Empire declined due to various factors, including corruption within the military, loss of discipline, and external threats from Barbarians. The Chinese counterpart also faced similar challenges, such as political instability and economic decline. Therefore, it can be inferred that both empires experienced a decline in their overall power and influence. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer is B: 'A shift from trade along the Silk Roads to sea routes in the Indian Ocean.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of empires led to a greater emphasis on the role of the father as the head of the household, as societies sought stability and order in the face of uncertainty.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage describes the forced labor system in Huanacavelica and Potosí, where the mita Indians were required to work in the mercury mine for 60,000 pesos paid by His Majesty. This indicates that the local Yakut and Tungus natives were also forced into labor due to the yasak tribute they had to pay under Russian control. The third principal reason the local Yakut and Tungus natives are ruined is that from the time they first came under Russian control, they have been forced to pay yasak tribute. This shows that the system of labor described in both passages came into being through the same means: adaptation of local forms of labor mobilization for their own purposes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Due to ethical concerns and a preference for utilizing local resources, Spain refrained from engaging in the African slave trade and instead relied exclusively on native American labor. This decision was made in order to avoid any potential backlash or negative consequences associated with enslaving Africans. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the importance of ancestor worship in China during the period 600 BCE to 600 CE, and it provides examples of how former kings cultivated their virtue and followed its example.

Additionally, the passage states that the king adorned himself with gold and jewels, which could have come from India. Therefore, the most likely evidence for trade with Asia is option C: The king adorned himself with gold and jewels, probably from India.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions horses in the Ghanian court, and we know the Mongols were renowned for their use of horses, so this could indicate trade or contact between Ghana and Asia through the Mongol Empire. Additionally, the king adorned himself with gold and jewels, which could have come from India as it was a major source of these precious metals during that time period. The people in his court wore silk robes, which were also a luxury item that could have been obtained through trade with Asia.

It highlights that despite the revolution, women were still not able to receive an education and their situation remained unchanged. The second passage, from Halima Ghomri in the 1970s, after Algeria's war of independence, also shows that women did not benefit much from the revolution as they continued to face challenges such as poverty and lack of education. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that revolutions do not always concern themselves with gender equality (A).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the call for women's rights during the French Revolution, suggesting that women often take on leadership roles and actively participate in revolutionary movements. However, it also mentions that despite these efforts, progress towards gender equality has been slow and limited.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The author of the passage is explaining that as Rome grew in power, its decline was inevitable due to the natural consequences of greatness. This means that the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'The empire became too large to control effectively.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that prosperity and conquest are incompatible, meaning that as Rome expanded and prospered, it inevitably led to its decline.
