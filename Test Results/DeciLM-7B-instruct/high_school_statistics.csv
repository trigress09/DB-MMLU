The central limit theorem tells us that the sample mean will get closer and closer to the population mean as we increase the sample size, regardless of the population distribution. This is because the sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes more normal-like as the sample size increases. So, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. At the start of the second year, there are 200 workers in total. From past experience, we know that 20% of these workers will no longer be at their job after one year. So, 20/100 * 200 = <<20/100*200=40>>40 workers will leave the job in the first year. After the first year, there are 200 - 40 = <<200-40=160>>160 workers remaining at their jobs. From past experience, we also know that only 5% of these remaining workers will no longer be at their job after the second year. So, 5/100 * 160 = <<5/100*160=8>>8 workers will leave the job in the second year. After the second year, there are 160 - 8 = <<160-8=152>>152 workers remaining at their jobs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the first year, 20% of the 200 workers will have left, leaving 160. Then, 5% of these remaining workers will leave, so we expect 160 - (0.05 * 160) = 152 workers to be on the job at the end of the second year. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given equation is Selling price = 15.9 – 0.983 (age). We can see that the selling price decreases as the age of the car increases. To find out how much the selling price drops for every year, we need to subtract the constant term from the equation: Selling price - 15.9 = -0.983(age). Now, let's solve for age: age = (Selling price - 15.9) / -0.983. This gives us the relation between selling price and age. From this equation, we can conclude that for every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The equation shows that the coefficient for the age variable is -0.983. This means that for each year the car ages, the selling price decreases by approximately 9.83%. Therefore, we can conclude that for every year the car gets older, the selling price drops by approximately $1,590.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability that a particular trial meets the requirements of this trial is given by the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, we have 12 trials and we need at least three women in the jury. So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(12,3) = 66 combinations. The number of favorable outcomes is given by C(12,3) * 30% = 66 * 0.3 = 20. Therefore, the probability that a particular trial meets the requirements of this trial is 20/66 = 0.303 or approximately 0.303. The answer cannot be determined without knowing the size of the jury pool.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 30% of the potential jurors are women.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The regression line represents the best fit for a set of data points. Residuals are the differences between actual and predicted values. Influential scores have large residuals, which means they significantly affect the regression line. Therefore, statement A is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Continuous data refers to values that can take on any value within a given range. In this case, I, III, and V are examples of continuous data because they represent ranges of possible values (speed, temperature, wingspan).

To find the predicted value of y when x=7, we substitute x=7 into the equation: ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42*7. Solving for y, we get y = e^(3.2+0.42*7). This simplifies to y = e^15.68, which is approximately 464.05. Therefore, the predicted value of y when x=7 is A: 464.05.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A complete census involves collecting data from every member of a population, which can be time-consuming and expensive. A least squares regression line showing high correlation is useful for establishing relationships between variables but may not always accurately represent the cause-and-effect relationship.

In this case, we have P(rejecting H0 when H0 is true) = 0.05 and P(failing to reject H0 when H0 is false) = 0.26.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The registrar's office has a large number of students failing to report a change of address, so we can assume that there are some incorrect addresses on record. A 95 percent confidence interval is used to determine the range within which the true proportion of students with correct addresses can be expected to fall.

B,"Let's reason step by step. A binomial model is appropriate when the outcome can be described as a sequence of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (e.g., success or failure). In this case, we have to determine which situation does not fit this criteria. The number of heads in three tosses of a coin meets the criteria because it involves independent trials (each toss) and only two possible outcomes (heads or tails). Similarly, the number of rainy days in a given week also fits the criteria as it involves independent trials (each day) and only two possible outcomes (rainy or not rainy). The number of girls in a family of five children does not fit the criteria because it is not an independent trial.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The number of students present in a class is a count of individuals, with each student either present or absent. This is similar to the other options, so a binomial model is appropriate.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). To find Q1, we need to find the value below which 25% of the data points lie. Similarly, to find Q3, we need to find the value above which 75% of the data points lie. Since the mean is 640,000 and standard deviation is 18,000, we can use the formula: Q1 = Mean - (1.5 * Standard Deviation) and Q3 = Mean + (1.5 * Standard Deviation). Plugging in the values, we get Q1 = 622,000 and Q3 = 658,000. Therefore, the interquartile range is Q3 - Q1 = 658,000 - 622,000 = 36,000 square feet.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range covers the middle 50% of the data. In a normal distribution, we can find this range by adding and subtracting 1.5 times the standard deviation from the mean.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of 0.25 ounces indicates that the distribution is approximately normal. We want to find the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces. To do this, we need to calculate the z-score corresponding to 3.9 ounces and then use the standard normal distribution formula. The z-score for 3.9 ounces is approximately -0.67, which corresponds to a probability of 0.2513 or 0.2513 x 100 = 25.13%. However, since we are looking for the probability that the mean amount per jar filled in the sampled jars is less than 3.9 ounces, we need to subtract this value from 1.

To find the probability of losing 7 straight times before winning the first time, we can use the formula: (number of outcomes that fail to meet the condition) / (total number of possible outcomes). In this case, there are 38 slots and we want to find the probability of not landing on a red slot for 7 consecutive trials. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 38^7. The number of outcomes that fail to meet the condition is 29 (since we have 18 black slots and 10 green slots). Therefore, the probability of losing 7 straight times before winning the first time is: (29/38^7) = 0.0053. The answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the ball landing on red is 18/38. Therefore, the probability of it landing on red for the first time on the 8th trial is simply 18/38.

When we take random samples of size 16 from this population, the sampling distribution of these sample means will also be skewed right. However, the standard deviation of the sample means will be smaller than the standard deviation of the original population because the sample size is smaller.

We are testing if the mean weight is greater than 4 ounces, so we need to find the probability of getting a t-value less than 2 with 15 degrees of freedom.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability is 0.2 that a value selected at random from a normal distribution with mean 600 and standard deviation 15 will be above what number? We need to find the z-score corresponding to this probability, which is approximately -1.645. Then we add it to the mean to get the cutoff value. So, the cutoff value is 600 + (-1.645 * 15) = 603.8.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of 0.8 (1 - 0.2). This z-score is approximately -0.84. So, the value we're looking for is 600 - 0.84 * 15 = 587.4. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the mean salary paid to office assistants in this company, we need to calculate the total salaries for each location and then add them together. In New Jersey, there are 128 office assistants with a mean salary of $28,500, so the total salary for that location is 128 * $28,500 = $364,400. In Utah, there are 32 office assistants with a mean salary of $22,500, so the total salary for that location is 32 * $22,500 = $710,000. Now, we add these two totals together: $364,400 + $710,000 = $1,074,400. Finally, we divide this total by the number of office assistants in both locations (128 + 32) to find the mean salary paid to all office assistants: $1,074,400 / 160 = $6,715. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the overall mean salary, we simply average the mean salaries of the two offices, which is ($28,500 + $22,500) / 2 = $25,500.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a person having the disease can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. We know that 95% of people who have the disease will test positive, and 5% of people who do not have the disease will also test positive. So, the probability of a person testing positive given they have the disease is (0.95/0.04) = 23.75%. The probability of a person testing positive given they don't have the disease is (0.05/0.96) = 5.17%. Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease given they test positive is (23.75/28.92) = 0.824 or approximately 82.4%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since 95% of people who have the disease test positive, then the probability of having the disease given a positive test is 95%. The total population is 100%, so the probability of not having the disease is 100% - 95% = 5%. Therefore, the probability of having the disease given a positive test is 95% x (100% - 5%) = 86%.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The telephone executive instructed the associate to contact 104 customers using their service and asked her to use a random number table to pick four names from each letter of the alphabet. This process results in a group of 104 customers to be contacted. Since the procedure uses a random number table, it makes use of chance (A). The procedure also results in a simple random sample (B), as each customer has an equal probability of being included in the survey (C). There is no mention of sampling error or bias introduced by this process, so D is incorrect.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error refers to the range of values that the true population parameter could take, given a certain sample size and confidence level. In this case, with a 95% confidence level, we can be 95% confident that the true proportion of Americans approving of the job the president is doing falls within the range of 43% +/- 3.2%. This means that about 95% of polls conducted in this way will give a sample proportion within 3.2 percentage points of the actual proportion of all Americans who approve of the job the president is doing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error of 3.2% means that there is a 3.2% chance that the true proportion of Americans who approve of the job the president is doing is not 43%. This is because the poll results can vary within this range due to sampling error. Therefore, the correct interpretation is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean income is $20,500 and the standard deviation is $3,750. This means that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. So, we can expect about 68% of the employees to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000. Since there are 400 employees, this would be approximately (68/100) * 400 = 272 employees.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the empirical rule states that 95% of values in a normal distribution are within 1 standard deviation from the mean, then we expect 95% of 400 employees to have an income between $16,750 and $24,250. This means that 95% of 400 employees will have an income between $13,000 and $28,000. Therefore, the answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 50% of days represents the range between the mean and one standard deviation above or below the mean. In this case, the mean is 3,250 customers and the standard deviation is 320. So, the range of customers served on the middle 50 percent of days is (3,250 - 1 * 320) to (3,250 + 1 * 320), which simplifies to (2,930, 3,570).",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that in a normal distribution, the middle 50% of values are within 1 standard deviation from the mean. So the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is between 2,930 and 3,570. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no relationship between variables or that a certain condition is true. In this case, we are given two samples (one for men and one for women) with different attitudes toward abortion. Since the question asks about the proper null hypothesis, it means we need to identify what assumption we can make about the relationship between these variables. The correct answer should be an assumption that does not involve any relationship or comparison between the variables. Therefore, the most appropriate null hypothesis is 'The proportion of ""pro-life"" men is related to the proportion of ""pro-life"" women.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis should state that there is a relationship between the variables, so it should be that the variables ""gender"" and ""attitude toward abortion"" are related.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A chi-squared test of independence is used to determine if there is a relationship between two categorical variables in a contingency table. In this case, we have a 3x4 contingency table, which means we have 3 rows and 4 columns. To calculate the degrees of freedom for this test, we subtract 1 from the product of the number of rows minus 1 and the number of columns minus 1. So, in our case, it would be (3-1) x (4-1) = 8. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for degrees of freedom in a chi-squared test is (number of rows) × (number of columns), so this test has 3 × 4 = 12 degrees of freedom.

Therefore, the correct interpretation of his z-score is D: 'This week his time was two standard deviations lower than his average time.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. A z-score of -2 means that his running time this week was two minutes lower than his best time ever.

In this case, the runner's time was two standard deviations below his average time.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A town has one high school, which buses students from urban, suburban, and rural communities. To study attitudes toward tracking of students in honors, regular, and below-grade classes, we need a sample that represents the entire population.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is the best way to ensure that every student has an equal chance of being selected, so it's the recommended sampling method in this case.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The study found that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites, which means there is a positive correlation between the two variables.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the appropriateness of using a two-sample t-test for comparing the number of contacts between boys and girls in this situation. We know that the sample sizes are both greater than 30, which meets one of the conditions required to use a two-sample t-test. However, we don't have information about the population standard deviations or the shape of the population distribution. Since these factors are not known, it is not appropriate to use a two-sample t-test in this situation.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the student should not use a two-sample t-test. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The two-sample t-test is used to compare the means of two groups, and its power depends on factors such as effect size, variability, and sample size. In this case, we are considering a change in procedure.

Therefore, only option B can affect the r value.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adding the same constant to all values of the x-variable would shift the data points but would not change the relationship between the two variables. Therefore, it would affect the value of the correlation r.

However, if we do not make any changes to the data or the variables, then none of these factors can affect the r value.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. An experiment is designed to test a hypothesis, while an observational study aims to describe or compare groups without manipulating them.

The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the volunteers were randomly assigned to either exercise or not exercise, this study uses blocking to control for potential confounding variables. However, it does not involve blinding or comparison, so it is not an experiment with a control group and blinding (A), nor an experiment with blocking (B). It also doesn't fit the description of an observational study with comparison and randomization (C). Therefore, the correct answer is D: None of the above.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The significance level is 0.05, which means there is a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). To decrease this probability, we need to increase the sample size. If we double the number of experimental units for each treatment, the total number of observations will also double. This will increase the power of the test, which means there is a higher chance of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The probability of a Type I error and the power would both increase.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the z-score is (2500 - 3000) / 225 = -1.7647.

A,"Let's reason step by step. An onion in the 28th percentile for weight has a value that is greater than or equal to the 72nd percentile and less than or equal to the 100th percentile. Since we know that the mean is 9.8 oz, we can calculate the 72nd percentile by adding two standard deviations to the mean: 9.8 + (2 * 2.1) = 13.5 oz. Similarly, we can calculate the 100th percentile by subtracting two standard deviations from the mean: 9.8 - (2 * 2.1) = 4.7 oz. Since the onion in question is between these two values, it must be greater than or equal to 4.7 oz and less than or equal to 13.5 oz. Therefore, an onion in the 28th percentile for weight compares to the mean by being approximately 4.7 ounces below the mean.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This is an example of a Type I error.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A Type I error would occur if we stopped production even though the tissue strength was actually within specifications, which means we should keep producing tissues even if they are below the required strength.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A one-sided test of a hypothesis about a population mean, based on a sample of size 14, yields a P-value of 0.075. This means that if the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the population mean is equal to the hypothesized value), then there is a 7.5% chance of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed one. In this case, we are looking for the range of t-values that would have given this P-value. The formula for calculating the t-value is: t = (sample mean - hypothesized population mean) / (standard error). Since we don't know the sample mean or standard error, we can only provide a range of possible t-values that could result in a P-value of 0.075. The most appropriate answer is A: 1.345 < t< 1.761.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since it's a one-sided test with a P-value of 0.075, the t-value must lie in the upper tail of the distribution, indicating a significantly high value. We can use the critical t-value formula to find the range of t-values that would give this P-value. The critical t-value is calculated as t = (t-critical) * sqrt(n-1), where n is the sample size and t-critical is the t-value corresponding to a given significance level. In this case, we have n=14 and a significance level of 0.075. Using the critical t-value formula, we find that t = (t-critical) * sqrt(n-1) = (2.326) * sqrt(13).

Now, we can find her percentile rank by looking up the inverse cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution at z = 1.11. This gives us a percentile rank of approximately 86.65%. Since she scored above the 80th percentile, she qualified for further evaluation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A score of 90 is higher than the mean, so Estrella must have scored higher than about 54% of the test-takers, meaning she didn't qualify for further evaluation.

If five players are selected at random (with replacement) from that season, we can use the binomial probability formula to calculate the approximate probability that at least three of them had more than 143 rebounds that season. The formula is P(X >= k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of players selected, k is the number of players with more than 143 rebounds, and p is the probability of a player having more than 143 rebounds. Plugging in the values, we get P(X >= 3) = C(5, 3) * (0.8965)^3 * (0.1035)^2 = 0.0879. Therefore, the approximate probability that at least three of them had more than 143 rebounds that season is 0.0879.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the third quartile for offensive rebounds is 143, there's a 75% chance for each player to have more than 143 rebounds, so the probability for at least three out of five is roughly 0.75^3 = 0.4219. However, we need to consider that players can have fewer than 143 rebounds as well. So, we'll add the probability of having less than 143 rebounds to the previous calculation: 0.65^3 + 0.4219 = 0.8965. Therefore, the approximate probability that at least three of them had more than 143 rebounds that season is 0.8965.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 80% of durations is represented by the interval that contains the median value, which is the 50th percentile. To find the median, we need to determine the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution. With a mean of 167 minutes and a standard deviation of 76 minutes, we can use the z-score formula to calculate the number of standard deviations from the mean that corresponds to the 50th percentile. The z-score for the 50th percentile is approximately 0.68, which represents 1 standard deviation below the mean.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city can be calculated using the formula: σ = sqrt(n * (x - μ)^2), where n is the number of observations, x is the mean value after adjustment, and μ is the original mean value. In this case, n=100, x=$130,000 (mean of $125,000 + $5,000), and μ=$125,000. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: σ = sqrt(100 * (130,000 - 125,000)^2) = sqrt(100 * 5,000^2) = sqrt(100 * 25,000,000) = $5,000. Therefore, the new standard deviation of the appraised values of houses in the city is $5,000.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Using the binomial distribution formula, we can calculate the probability of getting k or more successes in n trials with a given probability of success p and confidence level (1 - alpha). In this case, p = 0.5, n = 100, and alpha = 0.05. Using the formula, we find that k = 95.

The standard deviation of the total student costs can be calculated using the formula: √(variance of tuition + variance of books + variance of room and board + variance of personal expenditure). First, we need to find the variances for each category. For tuition, it's $0 because there is no variation in the cost ($4500). For books, the variance is $(350 - 280)^2 / 196 = 72.25$. For room and board, the variance is $(2800 - 2400)^2 / 196 = 180.25$. And for personal expenditure, the variance is $(675 - 600)^2 / 196 = 36.25$. Now, we add these variances together: $72.25 + 180.25 + 36.25 = 308.75$. Finally, we take the square root of this value to get the standard deviation: $\sqrt{308.75} = \boxed{$17.54}$."",

Then, we can use the standard normal distribution table or a calculator to find that approximately 34% of the scores are below this z-score.

To find the probability that its resistance is greater than 188 ohms, we need to subtract the probability of it being less than or equal to 194 ohms from 1.

Since we don't have these values, we cannot determine the exact probability. However, we can estimate it using the given information. The standard deviation is 12,000 miles, so the range of possible distances driven by a cab is from 75,000 to 85,000 miles per year. If we assume that the distribution is symmetric around the mean (which is not necessarily true), then the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles would be approximately 0.66.

Similarly, option B involves counting the points a hockey team receives in 10 games, where each game has two possible outcomes (win, tie, or loss). This can also be modeled as a binomial random variable because there are only two possible outcomes for each game. Option C involves drawing five cards from a deck of 52 without replacement and counting the number of hearts. Again, this can be modeled as a binomial random variable because there are only two possible outcomes (heart or not) for each card. Finally, option D involves counting the number of motorists not wearing seat belts in a random sample of five drivers. This can also be modeled as a binomial random variable because there are only two possible outcomes (",-,"Let's reason step by step. The hockey team's points can be 0, 1, or 2 for each game, and there are 10 games, so this scenario fits the definition of a binomial random variable with multiple outcomes.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range (IQR) of a normal distribution is equal to the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1). In this case, Q3 = 27.70 and Q1 = 25.00. So, IQR = 27.70 - 25.00 = 2.70. The answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation is 4, so the range within two standard deviations from the mean would be 2 * 4 = 8, which is the approximate interquartile range. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that for a large enough sample, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original distribution. This means that even if the random variable X has a non-normal distribution, its sample mean will still follow a normal distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large.

So, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of a set of sample means is calculated based on the variability of the sample means. When we increase the size of the samples, we expect the variability to decrease, which in turn leads to a smaller standard deviation. Therefore, the standard deviation of the second group will be half as large compared to the first group.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the sample size is quadrupled, the spread of the sample means will also increase proportionally, so the standard deviation of the second group will be four times larger than the first.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The sum of probabilities for any two events must be less than or equal to 1, as they cannot exceed the total probability space. Therefore, the only impossible statement is p + q > 1.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since probabilities range from 0 to 1, it's possible for the difference between two probabilities (p - q) to be less than 0 if q is larger than p. Similarly, the sum of two probabilities (p + q) can never exceed 1. Therefore, both A and B are impossible. C is also impossible because p / q > 1 implies that p is greater than q, which contradicts the assumption that they have nonzero probabilities. Finally, D is possible if E and F are independent and mutually exclusive events.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The dentist has seen a total of 7 children, and two of them develop cavities before turning 10. We want to find the probability that at least one child will develop a cavity before turning 10. This means we need to calculate the probability of not developing a cavity (P(X = 0)) and subtract it from 1, which gives us the probability of developing a cavity. So, P(X = 0) is equal to 5 out of 7, and 1 - P(X = 0) is equal to 6 out of 7. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a child developing a cavity is 2 out of 7, so to find the probability of at least one child having a cavity in a group of five, we simply use this given probability. Since there are five children, the probability that none of them develop a cavity is (1 - 2/7)^5 = 0.4963. Therefore, the probability that at least one will develop a cavity before turning 10 is 1 - 0.4963 = 0.5037.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The manufacturer wants to test the effects of four different temperature levels, two different types of pans, and three different types of ovens on the texture of its cakes. To ensure that all possible combinations are tested, we need to consider the number of treatment groups required for each factor. For temperature, there are 4 levels, so we need 4^1 = 4 treatment groups. For pan type, there are 2 levels, so we need 2^2 = 4 treatment groups. And for oven type, there are 3 levels, so we need 3^1 = 3 treatment groups. Therefore, the total number of treatment groups required is 4 + 4 + 3 = 11. However, since we want to test all possible combinations, we need to add one more group for each combination, resulting in a total of 11 + 1 = 12 treatment groups. The best description of the design of the necessary experiment is a randomized block design, blocked on temperature, with 12 treatment groups.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient r = 0.9 indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables, which means that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase. In this case, we can conclude that there is a strong association between the number of hours per day students study and their GPAs.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one found in our study, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the P-value is 0.07. This means there is a 7% chance that the null hypothesis (the new keyboard is no better at preventing injuries than the traditional keyboard) is correct. Therefore, we should reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value of 0.07 is less than the significance level of 0.05, so we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new keyboard is effective in preventing injuries. Therefore, the correct interpretation is A: 'The null hypothesis should be rejected.'",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A standard deviation of zero indicates that all the values in the sample are equal, and there is no variation within the data set. Since the sample has a standard deviation of zero, it means that the population also has a standard deviation of zero. Therefore, the statement 'The standard deviation of the population is also zero' is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the standard deviation is zero, it means there is no variability in the data, but this doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of outliers. The sample mean and median may or may not be equal due to the lack of variability.

D,"Let's reason step by step. An observational study involves collecting data without manipulating the variables, while an experiment is designed to test a hypothesis by manipulating variables and controlling for confounding factors. In this case, subjects were randomly selected and given three beers to consume, which implies that their reaction time was measured before and after drinking alcohol. This is a clear example of an experiment in which the subjects are used as their own controls. Therefore, the correct statement is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The researchers are observing the reaction times of subjects after consuming alcohol, without any intervention or manipulation, so this is an observational study. This type of study can be used to describe the relationship between alcohol consumption and reaction time but cannot determine causation. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is calculated by summing all the scores and dividing it by the total number of scores. When the largest score is increased by 40 points, the new sum will be the old sum plus 40 times the largest score. Since there are 10 scores in total, the new sum will be the old sum + 40 * largest score. To find the new mean, we divide this new sum by 10. Therefore, the mean will increase by 40 points.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the largest score increases by 40 points, the overall sum of the scores will increase by 40, and since there are 10 scores, the mean will also increase by 40 points. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The t-confidence interval is appropriate when the sample size is large enough to give a fair representation of the population, and the distribution of the data follows a normal distribution. In this case, the sample size is too small compared to the number of employees in the system, so the assumption of normality of the sampled population will not be satisfied. Therefore, the t-confidence interval is not appropriate in this situation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The t-confidence interval assumes a normal distribution, but the salary data is right-skewed with an outlier, so this violates the assumption and makes the interval unreliable.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation between height in inches and weight in pounds for a particular class is 0.65. If the heights are converted from inches to centimeters, the new correlation will be calculated using the formula: r = (r1 * r2) / sqrt((1 - r1^2)(1 - r2^2)). In this case, since the original correlation is 0.65 and there is no change in the weight data, the new correlation will remain at 0.65.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting inches to centimeters involves multiplying by a positive constant, which will reverse the direction of the correlation, making it negative.

The 2-sample t-test is specifically designed for comparing the means of two small groups, making it suitable for this situation with limited engineers in each office. However, there are other factors to consider such as geographical location and population size. While Atlanta and New Orleans are large cities, they may not be comparable in terms of salaries due to differences in cost of living or industry-specific factors. Additionally, the entire population information was used from both offices, which is not ideal for a t-test since it assumes that the samples were taken randomly.

Therefore, this method results in a simple random sample of the 1000 employees.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since each plant contributes the same number of employees to the sample, it ensures that every employee has an equal chance of being selected, making it a simple random sample.

Just like the standard normal distribution, all t-distributions have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, regardless of the degrees of freedom.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The first quartile of salaries is $48,815 and the mean salary is $55,800. To find the standard deviation, we need to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean, square it, and then take the average of these squared differences. We can do this by subtracting the mean from each quartile value, squaring the result, and taking the average of those values. The first quartile is $48,815 - $55,800 = -$7,985. Squaring this gives us 61,232,225. Dividing by 3 (since there are three quartiles) gives us the standard deviation of $10,476.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling is a method that divides the population into subgroups (strata) and then selects a representative sample from each stratum. This helps to ensure that the sample is more representative of the population as it takes into account any potential differences between groups. In contrast, simple random sampling does not take into account these differences and may lead to biased results. Therefore, using stratified random sampling is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5% means that we want to be 95% confident that the true proportion of voters for each candidate is within 2.5% of our estimate. To achieve this, we need to use a sample size large enough to ensure that the sampling distribution is approximately normal. The formula for calculating the minimum sample size needed is: n = (z * sqrt(pq))^2 + 3. This means that we need to find z and pq values that satisfy the equation. Since we want a confidence level of 95%, z = 1.96. The probability of voting for each candidate can be estimated from previous polls or surveys, let's say it's 0.4 for both candidates. So, p = 0.4 and q = 0.6. Plugging these values into the equation, we get n = (1.96 * sqrt(0.4 * 0.6))^2 + 3 ≈ 1537. Therefore, the minimum sample size needed is 1537.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the formula for sample size with a 95% confidence level and 2.5% margin of error, we get a minimum sample size of approximately 40 voters. This is because the formula is n = (z-score)^2 * p(1-p) / d^2, where z-score is 1.96 for a 95% confidence level, p is the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate, and d is the margin of error. Since we don't know the value of p, we can use the formula to find n: n = (1.96)^2 * (p(1-p)) / (0.025)^2. Solving this equation gives us a minimum sample size of approximately 40 voters.",D

The talk show host received 82% of the e-mail messages in response to his on-air question, which supports the death penalty for anyone convicted of selling drugs to children.

This means that people who are more likely to support the death penalty might have been more inclined to respond. Therefore, a more meaningful survey would involve a random sample of listeners or a control group.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The z-score represents the number of standard deviations from the mean. Since we want to find the value below which 25% of the data points fall, we need to subtract this z-score from the mean. So, the mass of egg would be 45 g - 0 = 45 g.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 25th percentile is one standard deviation below the mean.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The midterm scores were normally distributed with a mean of 52 and standard deviation of 4, so the z-score for a score of 58 would be (58 - 52) / 4 = 1.

The final exam scores were normally distributed with a mean of 112 and standard deviation of 10, so the z-score for a score of 118 would be (118 - 112) / 10 = 0.6. This means that the student is half a standard deviation above the mean on the final exam. Since the z-scores are additive, we can find the student's final exam score by adding the z-score from the midterm (1) to the z-score from the final exam (0.6): 1 + 0.6 = 1.6. Therefore, her final exam score must have been 112 + 1.6 * 10 = 127 points.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the student has the same standardized score on both exams, it means her raw score on the final exam should also be 58 points, maintaining the same relative position within each distribution. Since the mean of the midterm scores is 52 and the standard deviation is 4, we can calculate the z-score for a score of 58 as (58 - 52) / 4 = 1. This means her final exam score should be 58 + 1 * 10 = 68 points. However, since the mean of the final exam scores is 112 and the standard deviation is 10, we can calculate the z-score for a score of 68 as (68 - 112) / 10 = -4.

Using the formula z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value we want to find and μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation respectively, we get: z = (8.05 - 6) / 1.6 = 2.03. Now, we can use the inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF) or the normal distribution table to find that the corresponding z-score is approximately -1.47. Using the formula x = μ + z * σ, we get: x = 6 + (-1.47) * 1.6 = 3.95.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a hypothesis test is determined by the significance level (\u03b1) and sample size (n). A higher significance level means that we are more likely to reject the null hypothesis, while a larger sample size increases our ability to detect small differences in the population parameter. In this case, we want to maximize power when \u03bc = 65. Since the null hypothesis is H0 : \u03bc = 70 and Ha : \u03bc < 70, we can see that a smaller sample size (n = 15) will not provide enough power to detect the difference between the hypothesized values.

Observational studies involve actively introducing a treatment to a group and observing the effects, while still examining a pre-existing condition. Controlled experiments, on the other hand, allow subjects to self-select into the control group. Both methods can be used to establish cause and effect when properly designed. Stratifying in sampling is similar to blocking for experiments, as it involves dividing participants into groups based on certain characteristics.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The company wants to gather information about its customers who have joined in the past 12 months. To produce a representative sample, it is important to consider geographical variations in musical tastes. Option A would only include customers from the last month and may not be representative of the entire population. Option B would choose a random sample but does not take into account regional differences. Option C classifies customers by state and chooses 10 customers from each state, which could provide more insight into regional preferences. However, option D takes it a step further by choosing 3% of the customers from each state, which is a smaller percentage but may still be representative of the entire population. Therefore, the most representative sample would be Option C: From the list of all customers who joined in the last 12 months, classify customers by the state in which they live, then choose 10 customers from each state.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since musical tastes vary by region, we need equal representation from each state. Choosing 10 customers from each state ensures we capture the diversity of preferences across different geographical locations. This approach is more representative than choosing all customers who joined in the last month (A), making a random sample of customers on the list (B), or choosing 3% of the customers from each state (D).",C

This difference can be explained by nonresponse bias.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the poll and the vote suggests a selection bias, where the individuals who responded to the survey were not representative of the entire population of voters. This is likely due to nonresponse bias, as those who did not respond may have had different opinions than those who did. Therefore, the best description of this difference is A: It is an example of nonresponse bias.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of an accident on Highway 48 each day depends on the weather. If the weather is dry, there is a 0.2% chance of an accident; if the weather is wet, there is a 1.0% chance of an accident. Today, the weather station announced that there is a 20% chance of the weather being wet. To find the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today, we need to multiply the probability of an accident when it's dry (0.2%) by the probability of the weather being dry (1 - 20% = 80%) and add that to the probability of an accident when it's wet (1.0%). So, the probability is (0.2 * 0.8) + 0.1 = 0.0036.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the name given to a point whose removal has this kind of effect on statistical calculations is an 'outlier'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The removal of the point caused a drastic shift in the slope and correlation, suggesting a discontinuity in the data at that point.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The insurance agent is successful in selling a life insurance policy to 20 percent of the customers he contacts. This means that there are two possible outcomes for each contact: either the policy is sold (success) or not (failure). To construct a simulation, we need to assign numbers to these outcomes. Option A and D assign too many numbers to failure, which doesn't make sense since the agent is only successful in 20 percent of cases. Option B assigns two numbers to success and three numbers to failure, but this doesn't accurately represent the situation either. Option C assigns one number to each outcome, which is the most accurate representation of the scenario.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

However, increasing the probability of a Type II error (III) decreases the power of the hypothesis test. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I and II.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size provides more data and reduces sampling error, leading to a higher power to detect a true effect.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The company has offices in five different countries, and it wants to estimate the proportion of employees in favor of banning smoking on office premises. Since the views of people from different countries on issues like smoking tend to vary due to the influence of different local social structures, a sampling technique that takes into account these variations is necessary. Among the given options, stratified sample and cluster sample are both appropriate because they divide the population based on relevant characteristics (offices in five different countries). However, simple random sample is not suitable because it does not take into account the variations in local social structures. Therefore, a stratified sample or a cluster sample would be more appropriate for this situation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the employees are naturally grouped by country, we should use cluster sampling. We can randomly select a few countries and survey all employees within those selected clusters. This will ensure that each country is represented in the sample, reducing the potential for bias due to local social structures.",B

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The given information tells us that 70% of the trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds and 80% weigh more than 10,000 pounds. This means that the weight distribution is skewed towards higher weights. To find the mean, we can use the formula: \u03bc = (a + b) / 2, where a and b are the lower and upper bounds of the range. In this case, a = 10,000 pounds and b = 12,000 pounds. So, \u03bc = (10,000 + 12,000) / 2 = 11,000 pounds. To find the standard deviation, we can use the formula: \u03c3 = sqrt((\u03b2 - \u03bc)^2 * (n - 1)), where n is the number of data points.

Since the students studied more hours for the second exam, we can expect a positive correlation between the two variables. However, since the standard deviation of the first exam was 1 hour, it means that there was some variability in the number of hours students studied. Therefore, the correlation coefficient will be less than 1. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: 0.4.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the answer is A: 0.40 ounce above the mean.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.25. Therefore, the weight of a bag at the 40th percentile is 0.25 * 0.28 = 0.07 ounces above the mean. So, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering was (18, 41). This means that there is a 0.95 probability that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering the cholesterol level of any given individual by at least 23 points. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies a 95% probability that any individual's cholesterol reduction with Lipitor will fall within the given range compared to niacin. In this case, the range is (18, 41).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The z-score of -2.46 and P-value of 0.0069 indicate that the new process is significantly different from the previous one in terms of thrust. This suggests that the mean thrust of the engines produced under the new process is lower than the original model's thrust of 9500 pounds. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is D: There is evidence to conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.0069 means there's a 0.69% chance that an engine produced with the new process will have a thrust greater than the original mean of 9500 pounds. This is not significant enough to reject the null hypothesis, which states that the new process produces engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The student's time was changed from seconds to minutes, so the new time is equal to the old time multiplied by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). To find the new standardized score, we need to calculate the z-score using the new time. We know that the original z-score was z = 2.40. So, if the student's time is now t minutes, then the new z-score will be (t - 18) / 3.6. In this case, we can substitute the given information: (t - 18) / 3.6 = z = 2.40. Solving for t, we get t = 18 + 3.6 * 2.40 = 25.2 minutes. Therefore, the student's new standardized score is z = (25.2 - 18) / 3.6 = z = 2.40.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting seconds to minutes involves dividing by 60, so the z-score should also be divided by 60, resulting in a new z-score of 0.04. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to a systematic error or distortion in data collection, analysis, or reporting. It can occur due to various reasons such as selection bias (A), sampling bias (B), measurement bias (C), and non-randomization of the sample (D). In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to a sampling process that systematically excludes or overrepresents certain segments of the population, leading to a sample that doesn't reflect the population's characteristics.

However, statement B correctly explains bias as a sampling process that results in a sample that does not represent the population.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The purpose of a control group is to compare the results of an experimental treatment with a baseline or no-treatment condition. In this case, we want to study the effect of music on piecework output at a clothing manufacturer. To ensure that any observed differences in productivity between the two groups are due solely to the type of music played, it's best to have a control group that does not receive any music at all. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 'A third group for which no music is played.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. A good control group should experience elements of both treatments to isolate the effects of each music genre, so a group randomly exposed to classical or rock music would be ideal. However, since we are studying the effect of music on piecework output, it is important that the control group also experiences music. Therefore, the best option is A: A third group for which no music is played.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling is a method that divides the population into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics, and then randomly samples from each stratum. This allows for more accurate representation of different groups within the population. Simple random sampling, on the other hand, does not consider any groupings or subdivisions within the population. Therefore, a stratified random sample can provide information about each stratum in the population as well as an estimate for the population as a whole, and a simple random sample does not.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling ensures representation from all strata, providing information about each subgroup and the overall population, which simple random sampling doesn't necessarily achieve. Therefore, a stratified random sample can provide an estimate that is just as reliable as a simple random sample with a larger sample size.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In an experiment, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable, while in an observational study, he or she simply observes and records the observations. This is the primary difference between the two.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The main difference lies in the use of control and treatment groups; while both methods utilize these groups, experiments require randomization to ensure unbiased results, whereas observational studies don't. So, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A confidence interval is a range of values that has a specified probability of containing the true population parameter. In this case, the confidence level used is 95%, which means that if we were to repeat the sampling process many times and construct a 95% confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean weight of the oranges of this variety. Therefore, statement A is true.",A,Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of oranges from this variety will fall within the weight range of 7.58 to 8.72 ounces. This is true with respect to the confidence level used.,A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value represents the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained from the data, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. This means that if the P-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the observed data and what would be expected under the null hypothesis. Therefore, the best description of a P-value is option D: The probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis is true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value represents the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false, indicating the likelihood of a Type II error.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Option I guarantees a return of $25,000, which is certain and predictable. Option II has two possible outcomes: either a 50% chance of returning $50,000 or a 50% chance of returning $10,000. The expected value for this option is calculated by multiplying each outcome's probability with its corresponding return and then adding them together. This results in an expected value of ($50,000 * 0.5) + ($10,000 * 0.5) = $30,000. Option III has a 95% chance of returning nothing, which means it is not a viable option for the company. Therefore, the best choice for the company would be Option II, as it offers the highest expected return among the three options.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize expected return, the company should choose Option II, as it has the highest average potential return of $30,000 compared to the other options. Option I guarantees a fixed return of $25,000, while Option III has a 95% chance of returning nothing. Therefore, Option II is the best choice.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In this study, the production outputs increased with every change in music genre played.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To construct a 94% confidence interval for a population proportion, we need to find the upper critical value of z. The formula is z = 1 - (confidence level / 2). In this case, the confidence level is 94%, so we can plug it into the formula: z = 1 - (0.94 / 2) = 0.96. Therefore, the upper critical value of z to be used in constructing this interval is 0.96.",A,"Let's reason step by step. For a 94% confidence interval, we need to find the z-score that leaves 3% in each tail, which corresponds to a critical value of 1.555. This is because the area under the normal curve for z = 1.555 is approximately 0.9473 (rounded up to 0.94). Therefore, the upper critical value of z to be used in constructing this interval is 1.555.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given information tells us that the mean length of life for 60% of the parts is 3 years and the mean length of life for 70% of the parts is less than 6 years. We can use this information to calculate the standard deviation using the formula: \u03c3 = sigma / sqrt(n). Since we don't have the actual values, let's assume that the mean length of life for 60% of the parts is 3 years and the mean length of life for 70% of the parts is 4 years.

According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Since 70% of parts last less than 6 years, the standard deviation should be around (6-3)/3 = 1 year.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the sampling distribution of a statistic (e.g., mean, median) approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.

However, option D only focuses on the shape of the sampling distribution, which is not the complete description of the central limit theorem.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. It also states that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. Lastly, it states that if the sample size is large enough, the shape of the sampling distribution will be approximately normal. In this case, all three statements are true and describe the central limit theorem.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation measures how spread out the data points are from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates more variability in the data, meaning that some fuses may take longer to burn than others. In this case, Company II has a smaller standard deviation (5 minutes) compared to Company I's 10 minutes. This suggests that Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least 1 hour, as they have less variability in their burning time. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes. However, we need to consider the standard deviation as well.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The range is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values, which means that the largest value is 200 and the smallest value is 150 (200 - 50 = 150). Since the mean is calculated by adding all the numbers in the set and dividing by the total number of items, we can determine the mean by finding the average of the four numbers. The mean will be greater than 165 because 200 + 195 + 180 + 175 = 850 / 4 = 212.5, which is greater than 165. Therefore, statement B is true.",B,"{
