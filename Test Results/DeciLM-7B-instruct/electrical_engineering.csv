In this case, we know that the input voltage is 110 V and the output voltage is 150 V. To find the duty cycle, we can use the formula: Duty Cycle = (Output Voltage / Input Voltage) * 100%. Plugging in the values, we get: Duty Cycle = (150 V / 110 V) * 100% = 136.36%. Since the answer choices are not exact percentages, we can round it to the nearest hundredth.
