B,"Let's reason step by step. An approach-avoidance conflict is a psychological phenomenon where an individual experiences conflicting feelings towards a particular situation or object. In this case, the question asks about the relationship between our proximity to the goal and our desire to approach it versus our desire to avoid it. Based on the nature of the conflict, we can infer that as we get closer to the goal, our desire to approach it will likely increase while our desire to avoid it will decrease. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In an approach-avoidance conflict, the individual experiences both positive and negative feelings towards the goal, and these feelings remain relatively stable regardless of their distance from it. So, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Self-verification theory suggests that individuals have a need to maintain their self-esteem and will seek out information that confirms their positive self-image. In this case, the husband with low self-esteem and negative traits is likely to prefer his wife to make neutral comments about his abilities, weight, and mood (B). This would not contradict or confirm his negative self-evaluations, but rather maintain a balance that does not threaten his self-esteem.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Someone with low self-esteem and negative self-evaluations would likely prefer their wife to remain neutral and avoid making any comments that could exacerbate their negative feelings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statistical regression refers to the phenomenon where a study's results are influenced by factors other than those being studied, leading to biased conclusions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D because random assignment of participants to different treatment groups is essential for minimizing the impact of confounding variables and ensuring internal validity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Statistical regression becomes a threat to internal validity when the groups being compared have significantly different numbers of participants, potentially skewing the results. This is because it introduces bias and reduces the power of the study. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The CATHARSIS THEORY suggests that the expression of emotions, particularly negative ones like frustration, leads to a reduction in aggression. However, research has not supported this claim. Instead, it is believed that other factors such as high temperature or feelings of anonymity can lead to more aggressive behavior. Therefore, the CATHARSIS THEORY is unsupported by research.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The catharsis theory proposes that external factors, such as high temperatures, can contribute to increased aggression by creating discomfort and frustration.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A realistic job preview is a tool used to provide potential candidates with an accurate understanding of the job requirements, responsibilities, and expectations. This helps them make informed decisions about whether they are suitable for the position and can also help manage their expectations. The primary purpose of a realistic job preview is to reduce employee dissatisfaction and turnover.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A realistic job preview aims to provide potential applicants with a comprehensive understanding of the job, including its challenges and rewards, to attract a larger pool of qualified candidates. This is in contrast to developing an accurate job description or reducing conflicts between managers and employees, which are not the primary purpose of a realistic job preview. Additionally, while reducing employee dissatisfaction and turnover may be a secondary benefit, it is not the primary purpose.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The comparison rate should be based on a standardized and reliable measure of effectiveness. Incidence in the population of the disorder being eared is not specific to psychotherapy, while relapse in those who experience spontaneous remission may not accurately reflect the efficacy of a new therapy. Cure rate for the currently most effective therapists and cure rare for current treatment modalities are both too broad and may not be applicable to all types of psychotherapies. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Incidence in the population of the disorder being eared.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To accurately assess the effectiveness of a new psychotherapy, it should be compared to the cure rate achieved by the most successful therapists currently practicing, providing a benchmark for excellence.

Based on this information, it is clear that these medications are antidepressants.",B,"Let's reason step by step. SSRIs, MAOIs, tricyclics, NDRIs, and SNRIs all work by modulating neurotransmitter activity in the brain, similar to anticonvulsant medications used to control seizures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'Anticonvulsants'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. An agonist is a substance that binds to a specific receptor and produces an effect similar to the one produced by the natural ligand for that receptor. This means it can produce a partial or full response, depending on the strength of its binding. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An agonist is a drug that binds to a receptor but cannot fully activate it, resulting in a weaker biological response compared to a full agonist. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that Dr. Petrovich has been seeing a client in therapy for over fourteen months with no apparent change in the client's symptoms. This suggests that the current approach may not be effective, and it is important to consider alternative strategies. Option A advises termination without further exploration, which may not be necessary or appropriate. Option B raises the possibility of termination but also encourages discussion and referral, which could lead to more informed decision-making. Option C suggests searching for similar cases in literature, which could provide valuable insights. However, it does not directly address the current situation with the client. Option D assumes that fourteen months is a reasonable timeframe for therapy without significant change, but this may not be true for all clients or situations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: raise for discussion the possibility of termination and referral to another therapist.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  If a client shows no improvement after a significant period, such as fourteen months, the psychologist has an ethical obligation to terminate therapy and advise the client to seek alternative treatment. This is because prolonged ineffective therapy can be harmful to the client's mental health. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Ego Autonomous Functions are defined as the processes that allow individuals to develop and maintain a sense of self-identity, self-esteem, and self-worth. These functions help individuals navigate through life challenges and adapt to changing circumstances. In this context, statement A is incorrect because re-parenting is not an ego autonomous function. Statement B is correct as the Ego Autonomous Function can be involved in resolving conflicts. Statement C is also correct as the Ego Autonomous Function helps clients build more adaptive defenses. However, statement D is incorrect because pathology does not occur when the ego loses autonomy from the id; rather, it occurs when there is an imbalance between the ego and the id, leading to maladaptive behaviors and thoughts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Ego Autonomous Function's main role is to mediate and resolve conflicts arising between the id's instinctual desires and the superego's moral constraints. In this context, statement B correctly describes the function of the ego autonomous function in resolving conflict. Statement A is incorrect because re-parenting is not a function of the ego autonomous function.

A,"Let's reason step by step. EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) is a psychotherapy technique used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research suggests that its effectiveness for alleviating the symptoms of PTSD can be attributed to imaginal exposure, which involves recalling and processing traumatic memories while simultaneously engaging in eye movements. This process helps individuals reprocess their traumatic experiences in a more adaptive way, leading to reduced PTSD symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: imaginal exposure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. EMDR's effectiveness in treating PTSD is primarily due to the fixed visual attention component, which helps to desensitize individuals to traumatic memories by redirecting their focus. This technique allows patients to process and integrate these memories into a more adaptive narrative, reducing the intensity of associated symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Framing is a communication technique that involves presenting information in a way that influences how people perceive it.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Exposure to a nonaggressive model may not be effective because it does not directly address the root cause of aggression in children. Opportunities for catharsis might help release pent-up emotions, but they do not necessarily teach better ways to handle them. Social skills training is likely more effective as it teaches children how to manage their emotions and interact with others in a positive way. A threat of retaliation from a high-status person may be intimidating and could lead to further aggression.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A threat of retaliation from a high-status person, such as a parent or teacher, can effectively reduce aggressiveness in children by establishing clear consequences for their actions. However, this strategy may not be the most effective because it relies on fear and punishment rather than positive reinforcement. Exposure to a nonaggressive model, opportunities for catharsis, and social skills training are all strategies that promote positive behavior and can help reduce aggressiveness in children.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the GOAL-SETTING THEORY, goals serve two purposes: they are a basis for motivation and they direct behaviors. The statement that is incorrect among the given options is B: 'goal attainment is maximized when goals are specific and highly difficult'. This is because goal difficulty does not necessarily lead to higher goal attainment. In fact, setting unrealistic or overly challenging goals can actually decrease motivation and performance.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This statement aligns with the concept that goal attainment is maximized when goals are specific and highly difficult. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Motivational Interviewing is a counseling approach that aims to help patients resolve ambivalence, build commitment, and reach a decision to change. The basic principles of this approach include empathy through reflective listening (B), rolling with resistance (C), and avoiding direct confrontation (D). However, it does not support self-efficacy for change (A) as it focuses on building the patient's confidence in their ability to make changes rather than relying solely on their own belief in their ability to do so.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Reflective listening involves directly confronting the patient's ambivalence, forcing them to acknowledge the inconsistencies in their thoughts and feelings about change. This is a key principle of Motivational Interviewing. The other options do not involve direct confrontation or avoidance of self-efficacy for change.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Individual differences in the development of vocal language skills can be influenced by various factors, including social environment, hearing loss, nonparental early care and education experiences, and the particular native language in a child's environment. However, among these options, B (Hearing loss) is not a contributor to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills because it directly affects an individual's ability to hear and process speech, which can impact their language acquisition but does not necessarily contribute to individual differences.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hearing loss can significantly hinder a child's ability to perceive and process spoken language, leading to delays or impairments in vocal language development, similar to the challenges faced by children exposed to less common or complex native languages. However, variation in social environment support for language acquisition, nonparental early care and education experiences, and the particular native language in a child's environment are not necessarily contributors to individual differences in the development of vocal language skills.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Test validity refers to the degree to which a test measures what it is intended to measure. Among the given options, 'Truthfulness' and 'Stability' are not specific enough to describe the concept of test validity.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Helping behavior is more likely to occur when people feel a sense of belonging and connection within their community. Decreasing anonymity can help increase this feeling, as it makes individuals more accountable for their actions. Initiating programs to raise self-esteem may also be beneficial, but it does not directly address the issue of helping behavior. Diffusing responsibility among all members of the community could lead to a lack of ownership and commitment from each individual. Increasing the number of individuals in the community is not necessarily a solution, as it may not guarantee an increase in helping behavior.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

In contrast, airline pilots, word processors, and salespeople do not typically require vestibule training for their jobs.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Ethics Code outlines professional standards and guidelines for mental health professionals, including a requirement to maintain ethical behavior and avoid conflicts of interest. Dr. Stern's recommendation is based on the information available at this time, which includes an unresolved charge of sexual harassment against the psychologist. This charge directly relates to the psychologist's professional conduct and raises concerns about their ability to maintain ethical standards. Therefore, it is consistent with the provisions of the Ethics Code.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Dr. Stern's recommendation is ethical because it aligns with the principle of protecting clients from potential harm and upholding the reputation of the profession. The unresolved charge of sexual harassment against the psychologist poses a risk to clients, which justifies his exclusion from promotion until the matter is resolved. Therefore, option A is consistent with the provisions of the Ethics Code.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist provided brief behavior therapy for a driving phobia to a male client and they began dating six months after termination. This situation raises ethical concerns because the psychologist engaged in a sexual relationship with a former client, which is prohibited under any circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since six months had passed since therapy ended and the relationship developed organically with mutual consent, the psychologist acted ethically. However, engaging in a sexual relationship with a former client is generally prohibited under professional standards. Therefore, the psychologist exhibited poor professional judgment.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is self-verification.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The interaction between selection and treatment refers to the potential influence of the selection process on the treatment effect. In other words, it is the extent to which the results of a study are affected by the way participants were chosen for the study. This can lead to biased or inaccurate conclusions if not properly accounted for. The most appropriate answer is B: effects of a treatment do not generalize beyond the setting and time period of the experiment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The interaction between selection and treatment implies that the treatment's effectiveness might vary depending on the characteristics of the participants. Therefore, the effects observed in the study might not generalize to other members of the target population. This is an external threat for validity. So, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Factor-analytic studies on tests of motor function have revealed that most motor functions are well represented by intelligence (B). However, the studies also show that two factors, speed and strength, account for most of the common variance (A). This suggests that while intelligence plays a role in motor function, it is not the only factor. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Factor analysis aims to identify underlying factors that explain the correlations between observed variables. Since most motor functions correlate highly, it suggests they are all manifestations of a single, general motor ability factor. This is supported by numerous factor-analytic studies on tests of motor function, such as Purdue Pegboard. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Dr. Black's advertisement promises a lecture on relaxation techniques, but then decides to have attendees divide into groups for the last two hours to experiment with the techniques. This is not in line with her original promise of a lecture. Therefore, it would be unethical since she advertised the seminar as a \u201clecture.\u201d",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Learned helplessness is a phenomenon where an individual gives up trying to solve problems due to repeated failures. In the context of solvable and unsolvable problems, giving solvable problems eliminates the helplessness caused by unsolvable problems. This is because when one encounters a solvable problem, they realize that they can sometimes succeed, which changes their attribution with the realization that they have some control over their outcomes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Learned helplessness can be overcome by providing opportunities for success, similar to how partial reinforcement schedules can maintain behavior by intermittently rewarding responses. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a partial reinforcement schedule.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The research suggests that people who frequently view TV shows that depict violent acts are more likely to overestimate the chance that they will be the victims of violence. This is because these shows can create a false sense of familiarity with violence, leading viewers to believe it is more common than it actually is. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Frequent exposure to violent media can normalize violence and create a sense of desensitization. As a result, individuals might underestimate the likelihood of becoming victims of violence themselves. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B

During sleep, the brain strengthens connections between neurons that were active during learning, which helps in retaining information. In this case, the most appropriate answer is sleeping.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Studying an unrelated subject after learning new material can help prevent interference and improve retention by providing a mental break and reducing the likelihood of confusing information. However, it is important to note that this method may not be as effective as other methods such as sleeping or exercising. Sleeping allows the brain to consolidate memories and make them more accessible during recall. Exercising can also help improve memory retention by increasing blood flow to the brain and promoting neuroplasticity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. In an emergency situation, the more people available to help, the better chance there is for a successful outcome. Having multiple bystanders increases the likelihood of someone being able to provide assistance or call for professional help. The gender of the bystanders does not necessarily impact their ability to help in an emergency.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In an emergency situation, having multiple bystanders increases the chances of someone noticing the situation, interpreting it as an emergency, and taking action to help. The number of bystanders does not matter as much as their willingness to act. However, having several bystanders of the same gender or opposite gender may make them more likely to take action, especially if they feel comfortable around people of similar or different genders.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The frustration-aggression hypothesis suggests that frustration leads to aggression. Berkowitz (1971) revised this theory by proposing additional factors that can influence aggression. Among the given options, C is the most relevant as it directly relates to the internal locus of control, which refers to an individual's belief in their ability to control events and outcomes. This factor has been found to be a significant predictor of aggressive behavior.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Among the given options, only A and B are focused on individuals or groups affected by specific situations (institutional care facility and unsure about plans after graduation). However, A is more specific in addressing the needs of students resuming from institutional care facilities, which makes it a better fit for tertiary prevention. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Small-group counseling for students affected by the initial stages of divorce falls under tertiary prevention as it aims to provide support and prevent further negative consequences. Individual counseling for students resuming from an institutional care facility, career guidance offered to students unsure about plans after graduation, and large-group programs emphasizing development of children's self-esteem do not directly address the initial stages of divorce or its impact on students.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Self-control procedures are most effective when they are implemented at a time when the individual is less likely to be influenced by competing behaviors or external factors that may weaken their resolve.

However, these methods often lead to emotional reactivity and stress in individuals, making it difficult for them to learn new behaviors effectively. Additionally, punishment may only suppress unwanted behavior temporarily without addressing its underlying causes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aversive techniques are challenging because they primarily suppress unwanted behavior without teaching alternative, desirable behaviors, leading to temporary changes that are easily reversed. This approach also increases emotional reactivity and can cause unintended consequences. Inhibition co-conditioning is a type of learning process where an undesired response is paired with another response, which may not be effective in changing the behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. As an ethical psychologist, you should prioritize the privacy and well-being of your clients. In this case, releasing records to anyone other than the parents would violate their confidentiality. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong organizational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and behaviors that guide an organization's actions and decisions. A strong culture can facilitate cultural and other types of change (A), but it is not correlated with low levels of job commitment (B). On the contrary, it is correlated with high levels of job performance (C) and voluntary job turnover (D). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A strong organizational culture, with its emphasis on shared values and norms, can sometimes lead to lower job commitment as employees may feel stifled by the lack of flexibility and autonomy. However, it is also correlated with high levels of job performance, as employees are more likely to be aligned with the organization's goals and objectives. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Affective commitment refers to an employee's emotional attachment and involvement with their job, organization, or colleagues. It is a measure of how much an individual cares about the success and well-being of their workplace. Job satisfaction, productivity, job motivation, and turnover are all related to an employee's engagement and performance in the workplace. However, affective commitment is most closely associated with job satisfaction, as it measures the emotional attachment and investment an employee has in their work. Therefore, the level of affective commitment is least predictive of job motivation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Affective commitment reflects an employee's emotional connection to the organization, so it is likely to be a significant predictor of turnover intentions, as those with low commitment are more prone to leaving. However, job satisfaction, productivity, and job motivation can also be influenced by various factors beyond just affective commitment. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist has established a crucial piece of information about the child's history, which is essential for understanding the problem situation.

Therefore, the most accurate statement is that incorporating spirituality into clinical practice is imperative for understanding and utilizing its protective factors.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The forced-choice distribution of rated attributes in performance appraisal is a method that presents employees with a limited number of options for rating their performance. This method has several advantages, including eliminating statistical concerns about ipsative measurement (A), enhancing the reliability of ratings (B), and being more objective since it does not deal with the strengths and weaknesses of the employee (C). However, it is also easier and faster to use, since only two choices are available (D). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The forced-choice distribution method is advantageous because it simplifies the rating process for evaluators, as they only need to choose between two options, making it faster and more efficient.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The president implemented a financial incentive program to increase job motivation and satisfaction among employees. However, the results did not improve as expected. This suggests that the theory behind this program may not be effective in addressing the underlying issues of employee motivation and satisfaction. Out of the four theories provided, ERG theory focuses on the need for achievement, relatedness, and growth, while expectancy theory emphasizes the relationship between effort, performance, and outcomes. Equity theory considers fairness and justice in the workplace, and two-factor theory examines intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Based on this analysis, it is most likely that the president's efforts were not supported by any of these theories.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Expectancy theory suggests that employees are motivated by the expectation that their efforts will lead to desired outcomes, such as fulfilling their basic needs and achieving self-actualization. Equity theory posits that employees are motivated by fairness in the distribution of rewards and resources. Two-factor theory focuses on the need for achievement and affiliation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is expectancy theory because it emphasizes the importance of perceived fairness and the expectation of desired outcomes.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. In this scenario, both groups have equal numbers of men and women. The passage is read by both groups, but they are told that it was written by a man or a woman. Since the passage is the same for both groups, any differences in their ratings would be due to the gender bias they hold towards the author's gender. Therefore, we can expect that Group A will rate the prose as significantly better than Group B because they are told that it was written by a man, and men tend to have a higher opinion of male-authored works. The females in Group B will likely rate the prose as significantly poorer than Group A for the same reason.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Male participants in Group B, aware that the prose was written by a woman, might exhibit gender bias and rate the quality of the writing lower compared to the males in Group A. Similarly, female participants in Group B may also be influenced by this bias and rate the quality of the writing lower than their counterparts in Group A. Therefore, the likely results are that both groups will rate the prose as significantly poorer than will the other group.",B

Instead, they delayed their intervention until Monday morning, which was too late for the client. Therefore, the correct answer is A: unethical, because the client's needs were not addressed more directly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The client was clearly in distress and needed immediate medical attention. The psychologist should have taken the responsibility to call a physician directly. By delaying the trip and scheduling an appointment for Monday, the psychologist did not prioritize the client's safety and well-being. Therefore, the psychologist's behavior was unethical.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Berscheid's (1983) emotion-in-relationship model suggests that strong positive emotions are less likely to be elicited during the later stages of an intimate relationship than in its initial stages because people become more self-centered and less other-centered as they progress through the relationship. This is supported by the fact that each person's behavior becomes more predictable, and they work harder to be sensitive to the other's needs. Additionally, over time, people may become emotionally immune to the behaviors of others.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As relationships progress, partners become more attuned to each other's needs and put in more effort to maintain the relationship, leading to a decrease in intense positive emotions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B because in the later stages of an intimate relationship, each partner's behavior becomes more predictable.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Children actively shaping their own development involves them making choices and decisions that influence their experiences, behaviors, and learning outcomes. The options provided are all examples of children being conditioned or influenced by external factors. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Selecting contexts implies simply being present in a given environment, rather than actively shaping or influencing it. Imposing subjective appraisal is also not an example of children actively shaping their own development, as it involves only evaluating the context and not changing it. Affecting what takes place in the context is similar to conditioning, but it implies a more active role in modifying behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Carl Rogers, a renowned psychologist, introduced the concept of congruence in therapy.

However, when it comes to employment selection devices, they may not provide the most accurate information.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vocational interest inventories provide valuable information about various occupations, aiding individuals in exploring potential career paths. However, they are not recommended as educational decision-making aids because they do not directly contribute to the learning process or academic achievement. Similarly, they are not suitable as employment selection devices since they focus on personal interests rather than job-specific skills and qualifications. They also cannot be considered as aids to self-understanding, as they primarily assess one's preferences for different occupations. Lastly, vocational interest inventories do not serve as occupational information sources because their primary purpose is not to provide comprehensive data about various jobs.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Functional behavioral assessment (FBA) is a type of assessment that uses primarily observational methods to examine and understand the physical and psychological variables that impact behavior in a given environment or setting.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In an immigrant family, serious conflict between the mother and an adolescent child is most likely due to a combination of factors. Adolescence is a time when children strive for independence, which can create tension with their parents. Additionally, the differential rates of adjustment to the new environment can also contribute to conflicts. The enmeshment that is typical of families that have left their native land may also play a role in these conflicts. Lastly, the psychopathology resulting from the stresses of the immigration experience could be another factor contributing to the conflict. However, considering all these factors together, the most likely answer is C: the enmeshment that is typical of families that have left their native land.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Enmeshment is a common characteristic of immigrant families, where boundaries between family members are blurred, leading to conflict. Adolescent strivings for independence and differential rates of adjustment to the new environment may also contribute to the conflict, but they are not as likely as enmeshment. Psychopathology resulting from the stresses of immigration is a possible factor, but it is less specific than enmeshment. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Job satisfaction is a complex concept that can be influenced by various factors, including wages, responsibilities, and tenure. While it may seem intuitive to assume that higher wages lead to increased job satisfaction, research has shown that this correlation is not always strong. Additionally, working in groups without assuming responsibility might provide some level of job satisfaction, but it does not necessarily mean that the overall job satisfaction is high. Lastly, while job tenure can sometimes contribute to job satisfaction, it does not always decrease steadily as tenure increases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Job satisfaction is strongly correlated with wages, as higher pay typically leads to increased employee morale and motivation. In addition, having responsibility can also contribute to job satisfaction, as it provides a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The projective hypothesis suggests that individuals tend to attribute their own thoughts, feelings, and impulses onto others or the environment.

Explicit memory refers to the ability to recall information that is consciously learned and stored in long-term memory, while implicit memory refers to the ability to perform tasks or skills without conscious awareness of learning them. Research on these two forms of memory has shown that explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable. This is because implicit memory is more closely linked to procedural knowledge and habits, which are less susceptible to age-related decline.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their cognitive abilities naturally decline, which affects both their ability to consciously recall information (explicit memory) and their unconscious memory processes (implicit memory). However, the rate of decline can vary between these two forms of memory. Research has shown that explicit memory capacity declines with age, but implicit memory capacity remains stable.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the effect of maternal employment on children's development. We need to consider the provided options and their implications. Option A suggests that in families with lower socioeconomic status, working mothers have better performing sons and daughters than nonworking mothers. This implies a positive impact of maternal employment on cognitive development. Option B states that regardless of socioeconomic class, children of working mothers are less successful in school than other children. This contradicts the previous option and suggests a negative impact of maternal employment on academic success. Option C claims that young children whose mothers are employed are more compliant than those in families with nonworking mothers. This is not directly related to the question about development but rather behavior. Finally, option D states that maternal employment is particularly beneficial for boys when they grow older.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Justice is fundamentally about doing good and avoiding harm to others, ensuring that everyone receives the benefits they deserve and is protected from harm. This aligns with option C, which states 'Benefitting others and \u201cdo no harm\u201d'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Event-based observational recording techniques are used to record specific events that occur at a particular time, while interval-based techniques record data over a fixed period of time regardless of the event's occurrence. Rating-based techniques involve assigning numerical values to observed behaviors, and narrative-based techniques involve describing observations in detail. In this case, since the behaviors are overt, lack a clear-cut beginning and end, and occur with moderate frequency, the best assessment method is a narrative-based observational recording technique.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the behaviors occur with moderate frequency, it's important to track each instance of the behavior, making event recording the most suitable technique. Additionally, since the behaviors lack a clear-cut beginning and end, interval recording would not be as effective in capturing these instances. Rating and narrative techniques are not appropriate for tracking specific events.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A functional analysis is a method used to identify the relationships between variables in a system or process. In this case, we are looking for variables that can be controlled, moderated, dependent, or organismic. The most appropriate answer is 'dependent', as it refers to the variable that depends on other variables in the system.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A functional analysis aims to understand the underlying causes of behavior, which often involves examining organismic variables such as personality traits, cognitive abilities, and biological factors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'organismic'.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. MANOVA is a statistical method that allows for the simultaneous analysis of multiple dependent variables, which can be useful in situations where there are many variables to consider. In this case, using MANOVA would have been more desirable because it offers greater protection against Type I error and does not require multiple-comparison follow-up tests in order to interpret significant effects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. MANOVA is preferable because it reduces the risk of making a Type I error, and it also eliminates the need for multiple comparison follow-up tests, simplifying the interpretation of results. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bartering as a form of payment for psychological services is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While it may seem allowable in some cases, such as when the dollar value of the service and goods are established in advance (C), there are also potential concerns about exploitation and fairness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: allowable only if it is not clinically contraindicated and the relationship is not exploitative.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bartering introduces complexities and potential for exploitation in the therapist-client relationship, so it's best to avoid it altogether to maintain ethical boundaries and ensure fair compensation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. At birth, the least developed part of the brain is typically the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as thinking, reasoning, and language. The other parts of the brain, including the visual system, brain stem, and cerebellum, are also present but less developed at this stage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movement and balance, which are skills that are not fully developed at birth. Therefore, the cerebellum is likely the least developed part of the brain at birth. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A needs analysis is a process of identifying the training requirements and goals for employees within an organization. This information helps in designing effective training programs that meet the specific needs of the company.

Before developing a training program, it's crucial to understand the specific requirements and responsibilities of the jobs involved, which is best achieved through a job evaluation. This will help identify any gaps in knowledge or skills that need to be addressed in the training program.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In a two-variable situation where one variable is dichotomous and the other is interval and continuous, we need to find a correlation procedure that can handle both types of variables effectively. The point-biserial correlation is appropriate for this scenario because it allows us to analyze the relationship between a dichotomous variable (e.g., gender) and an interval or continuous variable (e.g., age). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Point-biserial.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since both variables are categorical in nature, the phi coefficient is the most appropriate correlation procedure to assess the relationship between them. The phi coefficient measures the strength and direction of association between two dichotomous variables.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Babbling is a precursor to speech and typically begins at around 4-5 months of age. During this stage, infants produce sounds that are not yet words but rather phonemes or morphemes. The most appropriate answer is B, as it states that babbling initially includes phonemes from the child's native language only.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Babbling reflects the sounds infants hear in their environment, so it would primarily consist of phonemes from their native language, which they are exposed to most frequently. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Adverse impact refers to a situation where the selection process results in differential selection rates between groups covered by law and those not covered by law.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The classic aging pattern is defined as a decline on one or more subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R). This pattern typically involves a decrease in verbal abilities, such as vocabulary and comprehension. However, it can also involve a decline in performance abilities, like block design. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that both verbal and performance subtests are affected.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The classic aging pattern suggests a decline in performance on tasks that require visuospatial skills and processing speed, which are primarily measured by the Block Design subtest on the WAIS-R. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The EPPP (Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology) is a standardized test designed to assess an individual's knowledge and skills related to the practice of psychology. It is not intended to protect the public from incompetent psychologists, but rather to ensure that those who pass the exam have demonstrated a sufficient level of competence to provide safe and effective psychological services. The EPPP is not solely a measure of job performance or a predictor of additional training needs; it is primarily a measure of knowledge and skills relevant to the practice of psychology. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The EPPP serves as a predictor of how well psychologists will perform in their professional roles, ensuring that they possess the necessary knowledge and skills to be effective practitioners.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is about the difference in vocalizations between deaf and normal children. We can infer that this difference should be related to the development of speech or communication skills. Among the given options, option A states that during the second half of the first year, normal children increase the variety of sound, whereas deaf children do not. This is consistent with the idea that normal children develop their speech and communication skills more rapidly than deaf children. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During the first 6 months, normal children experience rapid development in their vocal abilities, expanding their range of sound output more significantly compared to deaf children who may have limited auditory feedback. This leads to a difference in the variety and complexity of sounds produced by these two groups. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, which contains over 300 genes. This abnormality results in a variety of physical and intellectual disabilities. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a chromosomal abnormality.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Down Syndrome is a genetic condition, and like many genetic disorders, it is likely caused by the inheritance of two recessive genes from the parents. This means that if one parent carries a copy of the gene, they are carriers but do not have the disorder themselves. If both parents carry the gene, there is a 25% chance that their child will have Down Syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is two recessive genes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that has both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. However, the exact cause of schizophrenia is still not fully understood. While having a family member with schizophrenia increases the risk for developing the condition, it does not guarantee that the individual will develop it. The probability of an individual developing schizophrenia based on their sibling's diagnosis can vary greatly depending on various factors such as genetics, environment, and other potential contributing factors. Therefore, without more information about the woman's specific situation, it is difficult to provide a precise probability. However, we can say that the probability of her developing schizophrenia is likely higher than 0.01 but lower than 0.7.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since schizophrenia is primarily caused by environmental factors, the probability of the woman developing it should be quite low, similar to the general population risk. According to research, the chance of a person developing schizophrenia is about 1% (0.01). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The MMPI-2 is a widely used psychological assessment tool that provides information about an individual's personality and potential mental health issues. While computerized scoring and interpretation services can be helpful in facilitating the process, it is important to note that they should not replace the psychologist's expertise and judgment. Computerized interpretations may have limitations or biases, and it is crucial for the psychologist to consider other information obtained from their clients during the assessment process. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical guidelines emphasize the importance of human judgment and the potential risks of relying solely on technology, so using computerized interpretations would likely be prohibited. Computerized scoring and interpretation services may not always be reliable due to various factors such as algorithmic biases or incomplete data. Supplementing computerized interpretations with other information obtained by the psychologist is a good practice to ensure accuracy and validity of the results. Objectivity is important, but it should not come at the expense of subjective interpretation, which can provide valuable insights into an individual's unique experiences and perspectives.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pro bono work refers to professional services offered voluntarily and without charge, typically to individuals or organizations in need of legal representation, medical care, or other professional services. The Ethics Code is a set of rules that govern the conduct of professionals, including lawyers, doctors, and others. While pro bono work may be encouraged by some ethical codes, it is not explicitly required or prohibited by all codes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: encouraged by the Ethics Code.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Ethics Code sets high standards for professional conduct and emphasizes accessibility of services, so it likely requires psychologists to engage in pro bono work.

A,"Let's reason step by step. PKU stands for Phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of phenylalanine (a type of amino acid). This condition can lead to mental retardation if left untreated. The most effective way to prevent this is through dietary management, which involves restricting the intake of phenylalanine-rich foods and supplementing with a special diet that provides essential nutrients while limiting phenylalanine intake. Therefore, the correct answer is C: a special diet.",C,"Let's reason step by step. PKU is a metabolic disorder, and antibiotics are often used to treat various illnesses, so they might be effective in preventing the associated mental retardation. However, this treatment would not directly address the underlying cause of the condition. On the other hand, a special diet can help manage the symptoms by reducing the intake of phenylalanine, which is the amino acid responsible for PKU. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to HERSEY and BLANCHARD\u2019S SITUATIONAL LEADERSHIP MODEL, leader style is described in terms of task and relationship orientation. The Delegating Style is characterized by low task-orientation and high relationship orientation. This means that the leader focuses more on building relationships with subordinates than on task completion. Therefore, the correct answer is C: low task orientation and high relationship orientation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In the Delegating Style, leaders assign tasks and expect subordinates to complete them independently, which necessitates a high level of task-orientation to ensure successful outcomes. However, this style also requires a high level of relationship orientation to maintain open communication channels and foster trust among team members. Therefore, the optimal leadership style in terms of task and relationship orientation is B: high task-orientation and high relationship orientation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The most common functional psychiatric disorder of later life is depression, which is characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. Paranoia, hypochondriasis, and agoraphobia are not as prevalent or specific to late-life disorders.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hypochondriasis involves excessive worry about one's health, which becomes more common as people age and experience more health issues, making it the most likely functional disorder in later life. In this case, the most appropriate answer is hypochondriasis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Confidentiality is an important aspect in maintaining trust between professionals and their clients. The statement 'Confidential information may be revealed to others only with the consent of the client' aligns with this principle, as it ensures that sensitive information is not shared without proper authorization. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Confidentiality is a fundamental ethical principle, so revealing any information, even in seemingly harmless situations like public lectures, would require explicit client consent. Case material can be discussed with colleagues only after obtaining formal release from the client. Therefore, statement A and C are correct while B and D are incorrect.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In most situations, the holder of the privilege is the person who seeks help from a professional, such as a therapist or counselor. This person has the right to confidentiality and privacy in their interactions with the professional. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: the client.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the therapist and client are involved in the therapeutic relationship and share the responsibility of maintaining confidentiality, making them joint holders of the privilege.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The evaluation of a particular treatment fails to show an overall effect, but the experimenter finds that the most severely disturbed do show considerable improvement. This conclusion may be valid if a t-test comparing severely disturbed patients with less severely disturbed patients is significant. However, this conclusion fails to take into account regression toward the mean, historical and maturational variables, and the fact that the placebo effect is most pronounced in severely disturbed patients.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Severely disturbed patients are more likely to experience a strong placebo effect due to their higher expectations for improvement, which could explain their positive response to the treatment. However, this does not necessarily mean that the treatment is effective with extreme cases overall. The experimenter should consider other factors such as regression toward the mean and historical and maturational variables before concluding that the treatment is effective with extreme cases.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Margaret Mahler was a developmental psychologist who proposed that the development of a sense of self is related to separation-individuation. This process involves the child learning to differentiate between themselves and others, leading to the formation of a stable sense of identity. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Developing a sense of self involves understanding one's own emotions and differentiating them from others, which aligns with the concept of projective identification. Projective identification is a process where an individual unconsciously attributes their own feelings to another person or object.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Impulsive children often struggle with self-control and task completion. Self-instructional training aims to help them develop better habits and behaviors. Among the given options, changing their self-statements (B) is a common technique used in cognitive behavioral therapy to increase task-oriented behavior. This makes it the most appropriate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Self-instructional training aims to enhance focus and organization, so helping children write down their lesson objectives would provide a clear structure for their tasks and improve attention. This aligns with option A. Additionally, changing self-statements can help increase task-oriented behavior (option B), but it is not the primary focus of this type of training. Focusing thoughts on mood-elevating cognitions (option C) may be beneficial, but it does not directly address impulsive behavior. Using programmed instructions to shape adaptive behavior gradually (option D) is a valid approach, but it is more general and less specific to the needs of impulsive children.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The research on the counseling of minority group member clients indicates that they remain in counseling for approximately the same length of time as non-minority clients. This suggests that there is no significant difference in the duration of counseling between these two groups. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Access to mental health services is generally equitable, so minority and non-minority clients would likely remain in counseling for similar durations. However, research on the counseling of minority group member clients indicates that they may experience unique challenges or barriers to accessing care, which could impact their length of stay in counseling. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would remain in counseling for a significantly longer time than non-minority clients (C).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Z-scores are standardized scores that represent the number of standard deviations between an individual's score and the mean score. The purpose of transformed scores is to increase interpretability and allow comparison across different measures and tests. Therefore, statement B is not about Z Scores.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Z-scores represent the distance of a raw score from the mean, so subtracting the mean from the score would provide this information. However, the other options describe features of transformed scores that are not related to the Z-score calculation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Preadolescent siblings are children who have not yet reached adolescence, typically between the ages of 10-12 years old. At this stage in their development, they are still forming their identities and establishing relationships with others. In general, preadolescent siblings tend to be competitive and cooperative with each other, as they learn how to navigate their relationships and develop a sense of independence while also maintaining close bonds. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: competitive and cooperative.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As children enter preadolescence and develop their own identities and social circles, they naturally become more distant from their siblings and prioritize peer relationships. However, this does not necessarily mean that the relationship is hostile or conflictual. In fact, it is common for siblings to maintain a close bond while also competing with each other in various ways. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'competitive and cooperative.'",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a communicator is mildly to moderately credible, attitude change is greatest when the level of discrepancy between the initial positions of the communicator and the recipient of the communication is moderate. This is because a moderate discrepancy indicates that there is room for compromise and negotiation, which can lead to more significant changes in attitudes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A larger discrepancy between the communicator's and recipient's positions creates a greater opportunity for attitude change, especially when the communicator has some degree of credibility. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'large.'",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. A sliding scale is a pricing model that adjusts fees based on a client's income, allowing for more affordable therapy services for those with lower incomes. This approach can be beneficial for clients who may not have the financial means to pay full price for therapy. However, it is important to note that this practice should be used ethically and transparently. While there are no explicit ethical guidelines prohibiting the use of a sliding scale, it is still essential to ensure that the fees charged are fair and reasonable. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: ethically acceptable since it serves the best interests of his clients.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical guidelines encourage psychologists to consider clients' financial situations and offer services in a fair and accessible manner, which aligns with the practice of using a sliding scale for fees. Therefore, Dr. Manzetti's practice is ethically acceptable since it serves the best interests of his clients.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step.

Cognitive flexibility involves the ability to adapt and cope with pressure, so individuals with impaired cognitive flexibility might become anxious when faced with pressure. This is a common neuropsychological complication of AIDS. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Children who have a high activity level tend to be more energetic and engaged in physical activities. When faced with pressure, they may react by increasing their nonproductive motor activity as a way of coping or releasing stress. This behavior is not necessarily associated with anxiety, passivity, or physical and behavioral abuse. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Children with high activity levels are often anxious and nervous, so when faced with pressure, they are likely to become even more anxious. This is because their natural tendency towards being active can make it difficult for them to sit still or focus on tasks that require prolonged concentration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: becoming anxious.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The organizational psychologist has found that the validity coefficients for male and female applicants are different and statistically significant. This indicates that there is a difference in how well the test predicts performance between males and females. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'differential validity' as it refers to differences in validity between groups.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Discriminant validity means that a test can differentiate between different groups, so the test clearly has discriminant validity. The fact that the difference is statistically significant further supports this conclusion.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The process of administering test items to people of varying ages, races, and social backgrounds is called standardization.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Assessing job performance is a complex task, and there are various objective criteria that can be used to evaluate an employee's work. However, some criteria have greater validity than others. Absences, for example, may not always reflect an employee's overall performance or potential, as they could be due to personal reasons or illnesses. Salary, on the other hand, is a subjective measure that does not necessarily indicate an employee's contribution to the company. Accidents and productivity, on the other hand, are more objective measures of job performance. Accidents can indicate safety issues in the workplace, while productivity can show how efficiently an employee is completing tasks. Therefore, the most valid objective criteria for assessing job performance are absences and accidents.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Accidents directly reflect an individual's ability to perform their job safely and efficiently, so they are a strong indicator of job performance. Absences can be influenced by factors outside of one's control, such as illness or family emergencies. Productivity is subjective and can vary depending on the task at hand. Salary is not directly related to job performance. Therefore, the most valid objective criteria for assessing job performance are accidents.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. In personnel selection, it is appropriate to ask a person's age when age is a bona fide occupational requirement. This means that there are certain jobs where an individual's age may be relevant to their ability to perform the job effectively. For example, in some cases, older employees may have more experience and expertise than younger ones, making them better suited for certain roles. Therefore, asking about age can help ensure that the right person is selected for the job.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If employees in a certain age group tend to perform worse, it's reasonable to consider age as a factor in personnel selection. However, this is not always appropriate since age discrimination can be illegal.

Based on these considerations, the most appropriate answer is B: minutes to days, depending on the depth of encoding.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sensory memory holds information for a brief period, allowing us to process and consolidate it, so it likely lasts for about 60 to 90 seconds. This is the most appropriate answer.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa are both eating disorders, but they differ in their key features. Purging refers to the act of inducing vomiting or using laxatives to remove food from the body after eating. Binging is characterized by consuming large amounts of food in a short period. Maintaining a normal body weight is not necessarily indicative of either disorder, as individuals with anorexia nervosa may be underweight while those with bulimia nervosa may be at a healthy or even overweight weight. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'C' - bingeing.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa involve purging and bingeing, but maintaining a normal body weight is a key distinction, so all of these features are important for diagnosis.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Job enrichment and job enlargement are two different concepts in organizational behavior. Job enrichment refers to expanding an employee's role, responsibilities, and decision-making authority within their current position. This allows for more autonomy and creativity, which can lead to increased motivation and job satisfaction. On the other hand, job enlargement involves increasing the scope of work tasks without necessarily changing the nature or level of responsibility. Job enrichment is a subset of job enlargement, as it includes all aspects of job enlargement plus additional responsibilities and decision-making authority. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Job enrichment and job enlargement both aim to enhance job satisfaction by expanding the range of tasks assigned to workers, thereby lengthening the work cycle and providing greater variety. However, job enrichment goes a step further by giving workers quasi-managerial tasks to perform, which allows them to take on more responsibility and decision-making authority within their roles. Therefore, the major difference between job enrichment and job enlargement is that job enrichment provides workers with quasi-managerial tasks.",C

Precontemplation refers to when an individual is not yet ready to consider changing their behavior or even thinking about it in the next six months. This stage is correctly defined by option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Precontemplation implies that the individual is aware of the need for change and is actively planning to take action within the next six months. Preparation refers to considering a change in the next six months, but not necessarily taking any steps towards it. Action involves time and effort into modifying behavior, which occurs after contemplating and preparing for change. Maintenance refers to the behavior change lasting at least eight months, which is a later stage than action. Therefore, the correct answer is C: ACTION.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Participating in research projects is a valuable learning experience for students, and universities often have strict ethical guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of participants. In this case, all four options seem reasonable, but option C is the most accurate as it directly addresses the need for informed consent from students before they participate in any research project.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As long as students have the freedom to choose which research project they participate in, it satisfies the ethical considerations of autonomy and choice. Informed consent is also important but not sufficient on its own. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The WAIS-III is a standardized test that measures intelligence, and the Verbal IQ and Performance IQ are two of its subtests. A substantial difference between these scores suggests that the individual has a higher ability to process verbal information than they do in other areas. This pattern is most likely indicative of a learning disability, as it indicates a discrepancy in cognitive abilities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A significant difference between Verbal and Performance IQ scores often indicates difficulties with nonverbal reasoning and problem-solving, which are common characteristics of learning disabilities. Therefore, the most likely explanation for a high Verbal IQ and low Performance IQ is a learning disability.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The procedure involves repeatedly presenting a stimulus to the client until the attractiveness of that stimulus is reduced. This technique is commonly used in behavioral therapy and is known as flooding. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The repeated presentation of the stimulus aims to overwhelm the individual and extinguish their fear response, similar to the principles of implosion therapy. However, in this case, the stimulus is not being presented to an individual but rather to a client. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'stimulus satiation' as it best describes the process of repeatedly presenting a stimulus to a client until its attractiveness is reduced.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Autocorrelation occurs when the error term in a statistical model is correlated with the independent variable. In time-series data, this correlation can be high due to the inherent dependence of observations on previous ones. This makes it difficult to accurately estimate the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Therefore, autocorrelation is most likely to be a problem when using time-series research designs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In between-groups designs, participants are assigned to different treatment conditions, and the lack of independence between observations within each group can lead to autocorrelation. Therefore, between groups is most likely to be a problem when using this research design.",C

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures. It has several advantages over CT, such as higher resolution, better soft tissue contrast, and no exposure to ionizing radiation. However, in some cases, CT may be preferred due to its faster acquisition time, lower cost, and ability to detect certain types of injuries or abnormalities more effectively. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B (detection of a skull fracture).",B,"Let's reason step by step. MRI provides high-resolution images with excellent soft tissue contrast, making it ideal for detecting even small tumors that might be missed by CT scans. However, in the scenarios listed, CT is preferred over MRI due to its ability to provide better visualization of bony structures and blood vessels. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Stimulant therapy is commonly used to treat ADHD symptoms. However, not all children respond positively to this treatment. The statement that is incorrect among the given options is D: 'A lower dose of the treatment has the effect of improving social behaviors.' This is because stimulants are primarily used to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity, not necessarily social behavior.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While stimulant therapy can lead to immediate improvements in attention and behavior, these effects often diminish over time, requiring ongoing adjustments to treatment plans. Additionally, not all children respond positively to the medication, and some may experience side effects. Therefore, statement C is incorrect.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Reading disabilities are often associated with other learning difficulties, such as dyslexia or ADHD. These conditions can affect various aspects of learning, including reading comprehension and vocabulary acquisition. While some studies have shown that children with specific reading disabilities may have subtle hearing disorders, the question specifically asks about longitudinal studies. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: reading chills usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that people tend to hold two conflicting beliefs at once, and they experience psychological discomfort when this happens. In the given scenario, participants in both conditions are likely to feel some level of cognitive dissonance due to the mismatch between their expectations and the actual outcome (i.e., the experiment being dull). However, self-perception theory suggests that people tend to evaluate themselves based on their actions and outcomes, which could lead them to report greater liking for the dull experiment in both conditions. Therefore, neither cognitive dissonance theory nor self-perception theory can predict a difference in participants' subsequent evaluations of the dull experiment between the $1.00 and $20.00 conditions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Self-perception theory suggests that individuals infer their attitudes from their behavior, so those who received $1.00 for endorsing the dull experiment would experience greater dissonance and subsequently rate the experiment more favorably to justify their actions. Cognitive dissonance theory predicts that people will strive to reduce this dissonance by changing their attitudes or behaviors. In this case, participants in the $1.00 condition are likely to change their attitude towards the dull experiment to align with their behavior of receiving money for endorsing it.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. Structural family therapy focuses on the patterns of interaction and communication within a family system. In this case, the father is avoiding responsibility by going fishing instead of attending his son's court hearing, while the mother seems unconcerned about her son's behavior. The sister prioritizes homework over attending the court hearing. These behaviors indicate a lack of emotional connection and support within the family, which can be described as ""emotionally cut-off."" Therefore, the best description for this family is ""emotionally cut-off,"" corresponding to answer C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The son's repeated offenses and the family's lack of concern suggest that he holds a central and controlling position within the family, creating a skewed power dynamic. This is consistent with the concept of ""emotionally cut-off"" in structural family therapy. Therefore, the best description for this family is ""skewed.""",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The spinal cord is divided into 3 main regions: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral. Quadriplegia refers to the loss of function in both arms and legs. In this case, the most likely level of injury resulting in quadriplegia is the cervical region as it controls the upper limbs and lower trunk.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The lumbar region of the spinal cord is responsible for controlling movement and sensation in the legs and lower body, so damage at this level would likely result in quadriplegia. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a lumbar injury.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Object relations therapy is a psychodynamic approach that focuses on the relationships between individuals and their internal objects (representations of significant people in one's life). This differs from Freudian psychodynamic therapy, which primarily emphasizes the ego, id, and superego as the primary structures of the mind. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: issues of attachment and separation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both object relations therapy and Freudian psychodynamic therapy emphasize the importance of early childhood experiences and their impact on the development of the id, ego, and superego.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress. External locus of control refers to the belief that one's life is determined by external factors beyond their control. Insufficient praise can lead to feelings of underappreciation and undervaluation, which can contribute to burnout. A positive environment and micro-management may not necessarily increase the likelihood of burnout as long as they are balanced with other supportive factors. Age and quality of life are not directly related to burnout unless there is a significant decline in health or wellbeing. Lack of control and insufficient reward can lead to feelings of powerlessness and dissatisfaction, which can contribute to burnout. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A positive work environment with close supervision and high expectations can create pressure and limit individual autonomy, potentially leading to burnout. This is the case for option B. On the other hand, factors like age and quality of life are not directly related to burnout risk. External locus of control and insufficient praise (option A) may contribute to stress but do not necessarily lead to burnout. Lack of control and insufficient reward (option D) can be a factor in some cases, but it is not the most likely cause.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Group therapy can be beneficial for some patients, but it may not be suitable for others. One concern is that individual therapists may feel threatened or undermined by group therapy and therefore may not support it. This could lead to a lack of proper screening procedures and potentially negative interactions between the two therapists' suggestions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If patients find support and connection within a group therapy setting, they may feel less need for individual therapy and choose to terminate those sessions early. This is the main concern raised by therapists who do not support concurrent group and individual therapy. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Age discrimination is an illegal practice that occurs when someone is treated unfairly or differently because of their age. In order to deal with this issue, it is important for the psychologist to know that evidence of age discrimination exists in a legal context. The most appropriate answer is B, as it directly relates to the firing of an employee based on their age rather than work performance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Age discrimination claims require clear evidence of company policies that adversely impact older workers, demonstrating a systemic bias against them. The presence of such policies is the most important factor in determining whether age discrimination has occurred. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist should follow the ethical codes published by the American and Canadian Psychological Associations. In this case, the most appropriate action is to report the colleague to the appropriate local, state/provincial, or national ethics committee (B).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The primary concern should be the well-being of the client, so offering assistance and professional advice directly to the client is the most ethical course of action.

These strategies are typically introduced in elementary school, around 2nd or 3rd grade. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Young children demonstrate impressive memory capabilities from a very early age, so it's reasonable to assume they begin using rehearsal, elaboration, and organization as memory strategies by 2 to 3 years old. This is the most appropriate answer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Humanistic psychotherapy focuses on the individual's potential and growth, emphasizing their innate capacity for self-actualization. Psychopathology, in this context, is seen as a result of unresolved conflicts or severe trauma that have hindered an individual's ability to reach their full potential. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: unresolved conflicts.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Humanistic psychotherapy views psychopathology as stemming from unresolved conflicts between the individual's desires and societal expectations, leading to a sense of incongruence and blocked potential. In this context, the most appropriate answer is 'unresolved conflicts.'",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Attribution theories are used to assess behavior and provide a framework for understanding the types of information involved in this process. The theory that describes how people identify explanations of people's personal characteristics from behavioral evidence is the covariation model of attribution. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The theory described focuses on how people attribute blame and responsibility for harmful actions, leading them to make judgments about an individual's character based on their behavior. This is the definition of attribution of harm. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The sleep-wake cycle is regulated by the circadian rhythm, which is controlled by a group of neurons in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This nucleus receives input from the reticular formation and projects to other areas of the brain, including the thalamus. The thalamus then sends signals to various parts of the body to initiate sleep or wakefulness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: the reticular formation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The thalamus acts as a relay center for sensory information and is crucial for regulating sleep and wakefulness. It receives input from various brain regions, including the reticular formation, which plays a role in maintaining alertness and arousal. However, the thalamus itself is responsible for integrating these signals to control the sleep-wake cycle. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the thalamus.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. As an ethical psychologist, you must prioritize the well-being of the children involved in the custody case. Evaluating only one parent without considering the other parties may not provide a complete picture of the situation. Therefore, it is important to evaluate both parents and make a recommendation based on the results. This ensures that the best interests of the children are taken into account.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As an ethical psychologist, it's important to advocate for the client's best interests, so if the assessment is positive, recommending custody seems logical. However, we must also consider the other factors in the case, such as the husband and children. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In group counseling, confidentiality is a crucial aspect to maintain trust and safety among group members. The therapist should explain that the obligation of group members to respect confidentiality is not less of an issue than it is in individual therapy. This is because group members are sharing personal information with each other, which can be sensitive and potentially damaging if shared outside the group. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Confidentiality is a crucial aspect of therapy, and state/provincial laws typically protect it, even in group settings. The therapist should explain that the obligation to respect confidentiality is not less important than in individual therapy, as it applies to all members equally.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The DSM-5, which stands for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, is a widely used guide for diagnosing mental disorders. It provides criteria for various mental health conditions, including both categorical (e.g., major depressive disorder) and dimensional (e.g., anxiety disorder) diagnoses. The question states that patients who meet some but not all of the criteria for a particular diagnosis can still be assigned that diagnosis. This reflects the fact that the DSM-5 relies on a dimensional rather than a categorical approach to diagnosis, as it allows for more nuanced and individualized assessments of mental health conditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The DSM-5 uses a categorical approach, meaning diagnoses have specific criteria, but it allows some flexibility for cases that don't perfectly fit. This reflects the fact that the DSM-5 integrates aspects of both categorical and dimensional diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive dissonance refers to the mental discomfort experienced when an individual holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, values, or practices. In forced compliance situations, individuals are required to conform to a belief or action that is inconsistent with their existing beliefs. This situation leads to cognitive dissonance and greater change of belief will occur in such situations. The most appropriate answer is A: 'in the predecision phase' as it represents the initial stage where an individual has not yet formed a strong belief about the issue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive dissonance is strongest when there's a significant discrepancy between beliefs and actions, which is more likely in extreme polarization. In forced compliance situations, people are often required to act against their beliefs, leading to greater change of belief. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Case studies are a type of qualitative research where data is collected from a single instance or situation to understand it in depth. The purpose of case studies is not to measure attitudes, preferences, and satisfaction, but rather to develop theories and refine hypotheses. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Case studies provide in-depth information about a single case, which can be valuable as a pilot study to identify variables for larger research projects. However, they cannot be used for attitude measurement, preferences, and satisfaction, nor can their results be generalized to other cases. Therefore, statement A is not correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Intergroup hostility refers to negative attitudes and behaviors between different groups of people. In this study, finding tasks that required the efforts of all children led to a decrease in intergroup hostility. This approach is an example of superordinate goals, which are goals that are shared by all members of a group and promote cooperation and unity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The situation describes interaction between different groups of children, suggesting that intergroup contact is the key factor in reducing hostility. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'intergroup contact'.",D
D,Let's reason step by step. Thorndike's Law of Effect states that an organism will repeat behaviors that are followed by satisfying consequences and stop repeating behaviors that are followed by unsatisfying consequences. This means that a positive correlation exists between responding and aversive stimulation (C).,C,"Let's reason step by step. Thorndike's Law of Effect essentially states that every action has a consequence that influences future behavior. Among the given options, statement D best paraphrases this law as it highlights the positive correlation between rewards and the probability of recurrence of the response that follows.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The multiple baseline design is a research strategy used when the researcher wants to observe changes in behavior or performance over time, and it involves establishing a baseline for each individual or group being studied. This design is particularly useful when there are no reversals, assignments, selections, or insufficient data available. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The multiple baseline design is useful when it's difficult to select participants for different groups due to ethical or practical limitations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'B' - when assignment is not possible.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first thing to consider is whether the psychologist has the necessary qualifications and expertise to make such a claim. If they do, then it could be considered ethical. However, if they don't have the proper credentials or are making misleading claims, then it would be unethical. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C because the ad makes misleading claims of effectiveness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the psychologist is truly skilled and confident in their abilities, then guaranteeing a cure for anxiety could be considered ethical. However, it is important to note that making misleading claims about effectiveness can lead to legal consequences. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Crisis-oriented therapy is a short-term approach aimed at addressing immediate concerns or problems. The primary goal is to provide relief and stabilization for the client. Option A focuses on early childhood experiences, which may not be relevant in all crisis situations. Option B aims to ensure calmness and relaxation, but this can be achieved through various techniques rather than being a defining characteristic of brief therapy. Option C emphasizes setting clear goals and maintaining focus, which is a key aspect of crisis-oriented therapy. Option D describes an open and nondirective approach, allowing clients to explore all aspects of the crisis situation. However, this may not be practical or effective in every case. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option C: agree upon clear-cut goals and keep the sessions focused on these goals.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In a crisis situation, the therapist's first priority should be to help the client achieve a state of calm and relaxation. This is essential for effective communication and problem-solving.

B,"Let's reason step by step. When the spread of scores increases, it means that the data is more dispersed and scattered across the range of values. This directly affects the variance, which measures how much the data points deviate from the mean. As a result, when the spread of scores increases, the variance also increases.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Variance is a measure of how spread out the data is, but it doesn't necessarily change when the range of scores increases. In fact, if all scores are close to each other, variance will decrease. However, if there are some extreme values that pull the mean away from the median, variance can increase. So, the most appropriate answer is B: increases.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist has an established therapeutic relationship with the child, which means they have a duty to act in the best interest of the child. In this case, the most appropriate action would be to agree to testify only if she can evaluate all of the involved parties.

This would allow them to provide an unbiased opinion on the child's best interests. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Unpredictable noise in a factory can lead to hearing loss, stress, and other negative effects on worker health. To ameliorate these deleterious effects, it is important to provide workers with information about the potential risks of exposure to unpredictable noise levels. This can help them adapt to the situation and potentially reduce their risk of developing long-term health issues. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Allowing workers to file grievances about the noise provides an outlet for their frustrations and can help mitigate the negative effects. However, it does not directly address the issue of unpredictable noise exposure. Informing workers about the deleterious effects of the noise and helping them adapt to the situation is a more effective solution as it addresses the root cause and provides practical solutions.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors, including genetic predisposition and environmental influences. Excess dopamine or sensitivity to dopamine could be a contributory factor (A). White patients being more symptomatic (B) is not necessarily true as the condition can affect people of all races. Remission from the condition in the Third World is 65% (C), which is not incorrect. A lower rate of Schizophrenia diagnosed among African Americans (D) could be a contributing factor, but it's not necessarily incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is primarily caused by an imbalance of dopamine in the brain, leading to excess or sensitivity. This is a well-established fact and not incorrect. White patients being more symptomatic could be due to various reasons like genetics, environment, or lifestyle factors. Remission from the condition in the Third World is 65% which is a known statistic. A lower rate of Schizophrenia diagnosed among Africa Americans could be due to differences in genetic makeup, access to healthcare, or other socio-economic factors. In this case, the most incorrect statement is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Addictive behaviors are difficult to treat because they involve intermittent reinforcement, which means that the reward is not consistent or predictable. This creates a cycle of craving and seeking more of the substance or behavior, even when it has negative consequences. Additionally, these behaviors can be physiologically complex and variable ratio reinforcement can also contribute to their difficulty to treat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Addictive behaviors are difficult to treat because they often involve variable ratio reinforcement, where rewards are unpredictable. This makes it challenging for individuals to predict when and how much reward they will receive, leading to a strong desire to continue the behavior despite negative consequences. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 'provide variable ratio reinforcement'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Babbling is a pre-linguistic stage in which infants produce sounds that resemble speech. The question asks about the early babbling of infants from different language communities. Option A states that it contains the full range of phonemes that comprise all languages, but this is not necessarily true as some languages may have unique phonemes. Option B suggests that it is different for each language community from the onset of babbling, which is also not accurate as infants do not know their native language yet. Option C states that it is the same for each language community until the first words are spoken, but this is not true either because infants can produce sounds specific to their language even before they start speaking. Option D suggests that it depends on the phonetic structure of the language, which is a valid point as some languages may have unique phonemes or stress patterns. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: ""is different for each language community from the onset of babbling.""",B,"Let's reason step by step. Infants' babbling varies across language communities from the start, reflecting the unique sounds of their native languages. As they grow and learn to speak, these sounds become more distinct. Therefore, the correct statement is B: 'is different for each language community from the onset of babbling.'",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hofstede's (1980) five cultural dimensions are individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, masculinity, and long-term orientation. The United States scores at the top of the scale on individualism, which means that people in the US value personal freedom and autonomy over group goals and conformity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: individualism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is known for its hierarchical organizations and emphasis on success, aligning with high power distance and masculinity. However, Hofstede's cultural dimensions are not mutually exclusive, so we can also consider individualism as a factor contributing to the top score. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: individualism.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The supervisor is trying to increase his influence by being sensitive to the needs of his subordinates and acting as a role model. This behavior aligns with the concept of referent power, which is based on the admiration or respect that others have for an individual. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: referent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The supervisor's actions suggest they possess expert power, influencing subordinates through their knowledge and skills. This is in line with the definition of expert power as the ability to influence others based on their expertise or specialized knowledge.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A sliding scale is a pricing model that adjusts fees based on a client's income, which can help make therapy more accessible to those with lower incomes. This approach aligns with the ethical principle of beneficence, as it aims to promote the well-being and best interests of clients. However, it does not explicitly follow the ethical guidelines or prohibit any actions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical guidelines for psychologists clearly prohibit using a sliding scale fee structure based on income. This is because it can lead to inequitable treatment of clients, as those with higher incomes may receive more extensive therapy than those with lower incomes.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist completes an assessment and refers the patient to another psychologist for therapy. This action is ethical because it involves collaboration between professionals in order to provide better care for the patient. The therapist requesting a consultation from the referring psychologist is also ethical, as it allows them to gain valuable insights into the patient's case. However, there is no mention of who pays for the consultation, so option C and D are not applicable. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: ethical.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical guidelines typically prioritize patient autonomy and financial responsibility, so it's logical that the patient should cover the cost of the consultation. However, if the therapist is being supervised by the referring psychologist, this may indicate a conflict of interest or unethical behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In cognitive dissonance theory, individuals experience psychological discomfort when they hold two conflicting beliefs or behaviors. To reduce this discomfort, people tend to change either their belief or behavior to match the other one. This process is known as cognitive dissonance reduction. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Cognition; emotion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive dissonance theory suggests that people strive for consistency, so they would naturally adjust their actions to match their existing beliefs.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that Dr. Petrovich has been seeing a client in therapy for over fourteen months with no apparent change in the client's symptoms. This indicates that the current approach may not be effective, and it is important to consider alternative strategies. Option A suggests terminating therapy without exploring other options, which may not be the best course of action. Option B suggests discussing the possibility of termination and referral to another therapist, which could be a good option if the client agrees. Option C suggests searching for discussions of similar cases that have been treated and reported by others, which could provide valuable insights into potential treatment options. Option D suggests continuing therapy since fourteen months is not an unusually long time for therapy to continue without a significant change in symptoms. However, it does not address the lack of progress made during this period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Therapy often takes a considerable amount of time, and 14 months isn't unusual for complex cases. Continuing with the current approach seems reasonable. However, it is important to consider if there are any signs that the client may not be benefiting from therapy or if they have reached a plateau in their progress. If so, discussing termination and referral to another therapist could be appropriate. Searching the literature for similar cases would also provide valuable insights. Therefore, the most suitable answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The largest proportion of variation in therapy outcome is accounted for by factors that influence the therapeutic relationship and the therapist's ability to establish rapport with the client.

C,"Let's reason step by step. According to one criterion of discrimination, under which of the following conditions would it be safe to assume that a selection test does not discriminate against a particular racial group? The answer is C: 'The test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion'. This means that the test is unbiased and treats all candidates equally regardless of their race. Therefore, we can conclude that the test does not discriminate against any particular racial group.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If no one from a particular racial group has applied, it suggests that the selection process isn't biased against them, indicating fairness. However, if the test rejects applicants from different racial groups in the same proportion, it may still be discriminatory. The other options don't directly address this criterion of discrimination.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Attentional load theory focuses on how our cognitive system manages multiple tasks and processes information. The statement in option A talks about the unity of actions placing limits on attentional resources, which is a core concept of attentional load theory. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Attentional load theory aligns with the idea that our cognitive resources are finite, limiting the amount of information we can process simultaneously. The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus (B). This means that when we focus on one task or stimulus, it becomes harder for us to ignore other stimuli around us. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. Couple therapy can be beneficial for addressing alcohol dependence in the client and improving their relationship with their spouse. Inviting the wife to participate in therapy is acceptable as long as Dr. Dinwoody believes it will benefit the client's progress in dealing with his alcohol problem. The statement ""unacceptable because in this situation, the wife is vulnerable to undue influence"" is not relevant to the question and does not provide a clear reason for why inviting the wife to participate in therapy would be unacceptable. Similarly, the statement ""unacceptable because doing so creates a \""con\ufb02ict of interest.\u201d"" does not provide a clear reason for why inviting the wife to participate in therapy would be unacceptable. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Among the findings, it was discovered that laissez-faire groups maintained a task orientation longer than autocratic groups. This suggests that in an autocratic group, the leader may have more control over the tasks and activities, while in a laissez-faire group, children are given more freedom to decide on their own.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Children are generally flexible and adaptable, so transitioning from an autocratic to a democratic group structure wouldn't pose significant difficulties. The presence or absence of the leader in the autocratic group might not make much difference as children can still function without direct guidance. Laissez-faire groups maintaining a task orientation longer than autocratic groups could be due to various factors, such as group dynamics and individual preferences. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. The infant's behavior is a clear indication of their attachment classification. Initially, the infant cries and does not settle down even after being picked up by the mother. This suggests that they are struggling to form an attachment with their caregiver. However, eventually, the infant settles down and returns to playing happily with toys provided. This behavior is consistent with a secure attachment classification, where the infant feels safe and secure in the presence of their caregiver.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The infant's eventual calming down and return to play suggest a secure attachment style, indicating a healthy bond with the mother. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D

In this case, using a collection agency to collect money from a former client may cause harm or distress to her. Therefore, it is important to consider alternative options before resorting to such measures. Option A is not applicable as there are no ethical guidelines prohibiting the use of collection agencies. Option B and C are similar in that they involve informing the client about your intentions. However, option D suggests using a collection agency only as a last resort, which aligns with ethical principles of minimizing harm and respecting clients' autonomy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical guidelines for psychologists generally prohibit using collection agencies to recover unpaid fees, as it can be seen as coercive and damaging to the therapeutic relationship. However, there are some exceptions where using a collection agency may be considered appropriate. In this case, if you had informed the client at the beginning of therapy that you would use a collection agency if she did not pay her fees in a timely manner (option B), it could be seen as more ethical than simply deciding not to do so because using a collection agency is prohibited by the ethical guidelines (option A). Option C suggests contacting the client first, which may be appropriate but does not necessarily address the issue of whether or not you should use a collection agency.

The patient's memory impairment and lack of awareness of deficits point towards Korsakoff's syndrome, which is often associated with chronic alcohol abuse and thiamine deficiency. Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type (A) is unlikely due to the patient's age and normal aging effects (D). Pseudodementia (B) refers to a condition where the patient appears to have dementia but does not meet diagnostic criteria, which doesn't fit the given symptoms. Therefore, Korsakoff's syndrome (C) is the most probable diagnosis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step.

Functional behavioral assessments involve observing and analyzing an individual's behavior in relation to their environment and social context, which allows for comparison with typical behavioral patterns. Criterion-referenced testing compares an examinee's performance to a predetermined standard or criterion, while intellectual assessments evaluate cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Norm-referenced tests compare an individual's performance to the performance of a specified group of participants, which can include individuals with similar characteristics or demographics. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: Norm-referenced tests.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional research and program evaluation are both methods used to gather information, but they have different purposes. Traditional research aims to test existing theories and discover generalizable knowledge, while program evaluation focuses on collecting information important for timely decision-making. Therefore, the statement that is NOT true about the difference between traditional research and program evaluation is A: Program evaluation questions are often identified through the needs of a program's staff and stakeholders, while traditional research questions are identified by researchers using previous, existing research.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both traditional research and program evaluation strive for objectivity and reliability in their data collection processes, often utilizing standardized measures and controlled experiments to ensure validity. However, the primary difference between them lies in their aims.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The two theories that provide the conceptual framework for the evolution of mating adaptations are sexual selection and parental investment. Sexual selection refers to the process where individuals with certain traits have a higher chance of reproducing, while parental investment is the amount of resources allocated towards offspring. These two theories together form the foundation for understanding how mating adaptations evolve in species.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The evolution of mating adaptations can be explained by the contrasting strategies of long-term mating, where individuals seek stable partnerships, and short-term mating, where the focus is on maximizing mating opportunities. These two theories provide a conceptual framework for understanding how different species have evolved to cope with various environmental pressures. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In a state/province that grants the right of privileged communication to clients, psychologists have an obligation to maintain confidentiality and not disclose any information without written permission from their clients. However, if divorce is not specifically covered under the privilege law, it may be appropriate to make a determination as to whether or not your testimony would be useful to your client, and testify if you think it would help. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To avoid potential lawsuits or ethical violations, it is crucial to obtain immunity from litigation before disclosing any confidential client information, even in divorce proceedings. This ensures that the psychologist can maintain their professional integrity and protect their clients' privacy. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to testify only if granted immunity from litigation (D).",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The representativeness heuristic is a cognitive shortcut that people use to make judgments about the characteristics of another person based on limited information. However, this approach can lead to overestimating the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior because it doesn't take into account the limitations of working memory and base rate data.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The representativeness heuristic involves making judgments based on how closely an individual or situation matches a particular prototype or category, often relying on statistical data and prevalence rates. However, this approach doesn't take into account the base rate data, which is the probability of a person belonging to a certain category given their observed characteristics. This leads to overestimating the degree to which dispositional factors affect behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. During a deposition, an attorney for the opposing party may ask you to provide confidential client information. As a former client's lawyer, you have a duty of confidentiality and must protect your client's privacy. In this situation, you should refuse to provide the information without a court order (A). If the client has signed a waiver, then you can assert the privilege unless it is waived (B). However, if the information is pertinent to the case, you may choose to provide it (C). But since privilege is waived in this situation, providing the information without a court order would be unethical and could lead to legal consequences (D).",A,"Let's reason step by step.

People who have accidents at work might be less careful or attentive, which could be related to lower cognitive abilities. This could lead to a higher likelihood of dissatisfaction with their work (A). However, the question asks about the relationship between accidents and job promotions, not satisfaction. Therefore, we can eliminate A as an answer. B and C both mention factors that are likely to be present in accident-prone workers, but they do not directly address the question of whether these workers tend to have more recent life stress than accident-free workers (C). D is also unlikely, as intelligence is generally not a factor in work accidents. Therefore, we can eliminate B and D as answers. This leaves us with C as the most likely answer.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. As we age, our cognitive abilities tend to decline, particularly in areas that require quick processing and decision-making. Continuous paced data processing requires a high level of mental agility and the ability to process information quickly, which is less likely to be maintained as we get older. On the other hand, knowledge-based judgments with no time pressure can be maintained or even improved with age, as our experience and expertise grow. Relatively undemanding activities are unlikely to have a strong relationship with age, as they do not require significant cognitive effort. Skilled manual labor may involve physical demands that could decline with age, but it also requires some level of mental processing and coordination, which can be maintained or even improved with experience.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they may prefer less demanding activities that require less physical exertion or cognitive effort. This is because their mental and physical abilities decline with age. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'C' - relatively undemanding activities.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Antisocial personalities are characterized by a lack of empathy and disregard for social norms.

D,"Let's reason step by step. When the relationship between the predictor (the X variable) and the criterion (the Y variable) is curvilinear, it means that there is a non-linear association between them. In this case, we need to use a correlation coefficient that can handle non-linear relationships. The appropriate correlation coefficients for interval or ratio scale variables are rho (rho), tau (tau), and eta (eta). However, the most commonly used one in this scenario is rho (rho).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since both variables are measured on an interval or ratio scale, the Pearson correlation coefficient (rho) is the most suitable choice for assessing their relationship. This is because it can handle curvilinear relationships and provides a measure of linear association between two continuous variables.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dr. Hanson's ethical responsibilities include upholding the ethical guidelines and promoting a safe work environment. In this case, sexual harassment is explicitly prohibited by the ethical guidelines. Therefore, Dr. Hanson has acted ethically since he is not considering the psychologist for promotion due to the unresolved charge of sexual harassment.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Elderly persons are a diverse group with varying cognitive abilities, but generally speaking, they tend to have more issues that can be addressed meaningfully in psychotherapy due to the accumulation of life experiences and challenges. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Elderly individuals typically have fewer unresolved issues or emotional challenges that require therapeutic intervention compared to younger people. They may also have more difficulty learning and remembering things due to age-related cognitive decline. However, the elderly population does show greater within-age-group differences than younger persons, which can make it challenging for therapists to generalize their approach.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Magical thinking is a cognitive process in which individuals attribute causality to supernatural or mystical forces, rather than rational explanations.

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is another behavioral condition characterized by defiance, anger, and hostility towards authority figures. Asperger syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social communication and interaction. Since conduct disorder and ADHD share similarities, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Asperger syndrome is a distinct disorder from conditions like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, so it cannot be diagnosed concurrently. Rett's disorder is a rare genetic condition that affects brain development and behavior, which also makes it unlikely to be diagnosed alongside conduct disorder.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Withdrawal delirium is a condition that can occur when someone stops taking certain substances. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms depends on the substance being discontinued. In this case, the most likely answer is Phenobarbital because it has a high potential for causing withdrawal delirium.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Heroin is known to cause intense withdrawal symptoms, including delirium, making it the most likely substance to induce such a reaction upon discontinuation. Cocaine and LSD are also psychoactive substances but do not typically cause severe withdrawal symptoms like heroin does.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The empirical literature suggests that when mothers give their children's developmental and social histories, the mothers' memories are most accurate about child-rearing practices. This is because they have direct experience with these practices and can recall them more accurately than other aspects of their children's lives such as school relations or motor development and weight gain.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mothers tend to have the most vivid memories of their children's school experiences, as these involve frequent interactions with teachers and other parents. Interpersonal relations are also important, but they may not be as specific or detailed as school-related memories.

This means that if one person in the group performs poorly, it will negatively impact the overall performance of the group. Therefore, the correct answer is 'additive'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In a compensatory task, the group's overall performance is determined by the average ability of its members, allowing stronger members to compensate for weaker ones. On the other hand, in an additive task, the group's performance is limited by the performance of the least skilled or knowledgeable member. Therefore, the correct answer is A: additive.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The original idea for the study was derived from the work of the faculty advisor, and the student used the facilities provided by the advisor to conduct the research. However, the student is the one who designed and conducted the research project, wrote the journal article, and submitted it for publication. Therefore, the most appropriate authorship credit would be for the student to be listed as first author.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the faculty advisor provided the initial idea and research facilities, they hold the primary claim to authorship and have the right to be listed first. However, it is important for the student to discuss this with their advisor and come to a mutual agreement on authorship credit. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Rancho Los Amigos Scale of Cognitive Functioning is a tool used to assess the cognitive abilities of individuals with neurological disorders or injuries. Level 4 on this scale indicates that the person has moderate impairment in their cognitive functioning, but they are still able to communicate and interact with others. This level does not indicate nonresponsiveness or confusion, as levels A and B suggest. It also doesn't imply superior intelligence, as level D suggests. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A Level 4 rating on the Rancho Los Amigos Scale signifies superior cognitive abilities, exceeding expectations for the individual's age and background. This indicates that they are functioning at a high intellectual level. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The chief investigator is a licensed psychologist, which means he has expertise in ethics and research practices. He should prioritize the well-being of the participant and their autonomy over the needs of the study. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: allow the student to withdraw from the study.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The student signed an informed consent form, which legally obligates them to participate in the study and prevents them from withdrawing their data. Therefore, the chief investigator should remind the student that he cannot request his data be withdrawn.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A stroke that affects the posterior region of the corpus callosum, as described in the question, may result in a disconnection between visual centers and language centers of the brain. This can lead to difficulties in both writing (agraphia) and reading (alexia). However, since the question specifically mentions the posterior region of the corpus callosum, it is more likely that the stroke will affect the visual centers more than the language centers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Agraphia without alexia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Damage to the corpus callosum, disrupting communication between brain regions, would result in aphasia, a language disorder affecting both comprehension and expression. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Aphasia.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Equity theory is a concept that explains how people evaluate their satisfaction in close personal relationships. It suggests that individuals compare their contributions to the relationship with their partner's contributions, as well as their own outcomes compared to others. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Equity theory posits that relationship satisfaction is influenced by comparisons between one's current relationship and past relationships, as individuals seek fairness and balance over time. This means that a person's satisfaction in a close personal relationship is related to their perceptions of the relative utility of the relationship (A). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about an aspect of development that is more plastic, which means it can be easily changed or influenced. Among the given options, 'More or less fixed and difficult to change' (A) and 'Not heavily influenced by the environment' (B) are not aspects that can be easily changed. 'Relatively malleable' (C) is a term used to describe something that can be easily changed or influenced. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aspects of development that are more plastic are those that are less relevant to the overall developmental trajectory and have minimal impact on an individual's growth. This is because they can be easily influenced or changed by environmental factors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: relatively malleable.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Agoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by fear and avoidance of situations that may trigger panic or anxiety. The most effective behavioral treatment for agoraphobic is prolonged exposure in vivo, which involves gradually exposing the individual to feared situations while providing support and guidance. This method has been shown to be highly effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The most effective treatment for agoraphobia involves shaping desired behaviors through a system of rewards and reinforcement, gradually encouraging individuals to confront their fears. This approach is known as behavioral therapy or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales (A) are designed to assess verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities, but the question specifically mentions a nonverbal adolescent. Leiter\u2013R (B), Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children\u2013II (C), and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children\u2013IV (D) are all designed to assess verbal cognitive abilities, making them less appropriate for a nonverbal adolescent. Therefore, the most appropriate measure of general cognitive abilities would be Leiter\u2013R.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, known for their comprehensive assessment of cognitive abilities, would be the most appropriate choice for evaluating a nonverbal adolescent. This is because it does not rely on verbal skills and can provide a more accurate representation of their cognitive functioning.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Psychotherapy is a form of treatment that involves talking with a mental health professional to address emotional or behavioral issues. The effectiveness of psychotherapy can vary depending on various factors, including the type of therapy used and the individual client's needs. However, research has shown that some types of therapy may be more effective for certain populations. For example, culturally sensitive therapies have been found to be more effective for minority clients compared to nonminority clients. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Psychotherapy is generally more effective when the therapist and client share the same racial or ethnic background, as this fosters understanding and trust. However, there is limited research on whether psychotherapy is more effective for minority or nonminority clients specifically. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about which group benefits more from therapy. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: equally effective.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Split brains refer to a condition where the cerebral hemispheres are separated by a surgical incision or other means, resulting in two separate functional units. Studies on these individuals have found that certain visuospatial tasks are performed better by the right hemisphere than by the left. This is because the right hemisphere is primarily responsible for processing visual information and spatial relationships. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The right hemisphere of the brain is known to be involved in creative and emotional aspects of communication, which are important for verbal information processing. Studies on split brains have found that certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed better by the right hemisphere than by the left. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The use of animals in psychological research raises ethical concerns due to the potential harm inflicted on them. While some argue that animal testing should be avoided whenever possible, others believe it can be justified if certain conditions are met. Option C best describes this viewpoint, as it acknowledges the need for alternative procedures and justifies the use of animals when their pain or stress is minimized and the potential value of the study outweighs any harm caused.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The primary concern in animal research ethics is to minimize pain and stress, ensuring the animal's well-being throughout the study and ending its life as quickly as possible when necessary. Statement C best describes this obligation, as it emphasizes that inflicting pain or stress on animals is acceptable only if there are no alternative procedures available and the potential value of the study justifies the use of such a procedure.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The program of treatment relies on graduated exposure to traveling by bus, with actual real-life behavioral activities increased across trials. This is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy called 'exposure therapy'. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'flooding', which is a type of exposure therapy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Flooding is a therapeutic technique where the individual is directly exposed to the most feared situation, in this case, traveling by bus, to overcome their phobia. Modeling involves observing someone else perform the desired behavior, while reinforced practice involves practicing the desired behavior repeatedly. Implosion is not a recognized treatment for phobias. Therefore, the correct answer is A: flooding.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional learning theories suggest that an infant's crying is influenced by their level of arousal, which can be affected by various factors such as hunger, pain, or discomfort. In this case, since both families provide immediate attention during the day but not at night, it is likely that the length of nighttime crying will depend on the level of arousal for each infant. Therefore, neither family A nor B's infant will tend to cry more than the other at any time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The length of nighttime crying in infants is primarily influenced by their level of arousal and not by the response they receive during the day. According to traditional learning theories, it would be anticipated that both family A and B infants will cry for similar periods of time at night regardless of whether they received immediate attention or delayed responses from their parents.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Random assignment refers to the process of randomly assigning participants to different treatment or control groups in a study. On the other hand, random selection is the process of selecting participants from a larger pool for inclusion in a study. In this context, both concepts are related to controlling for threats to internal validity. However, they differ in their application. Random assignment is used to ensure that participants are distributed evenly across treatment and control groups, while random selection is used to select participants who are similar on the experimental variable (EV) and then divide them between groups. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Random assignment refers to the process of selecting participants for a study from a larger population, ensuring that each individual has an equal chance of being included. On the other hand, random selection is the process of choosing specific groups or subsets of participants from the larger population. While both are important in controlling for threats to internal validity, they serve different purposes. Random assignment ensures that participants are distributed evenly across treatment and control groups, while random selection allows for the creation of additional experimental groups. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. When a subordinate participates in goal setting, they have more control over the goals they set for themselves. This increased involvement often leads to them selecting goals that are more challenging than those set unilaterally by their supervisors. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 'more challenging'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Subordinates, when given the opportunity to participate in goal setting, often lack the experience and understanding of the task to set achievable goals, leading to goals that are never accomplished. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
