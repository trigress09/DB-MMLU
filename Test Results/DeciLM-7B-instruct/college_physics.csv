Since the frequency of a resonating pipe is inversely proportional to the speed of sound, we can calculate the new frequency as follows: New frequency = Old frequency * (New speed of sound / Old speed of sound). In this case, the old frequency is 440 Hz and the new speed of sound is 97% of what it would be at 20°C. So, the new frequency is 440 Hz * (1 - 3%) = 433 Hz.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of 3C9 are shifted so far into the red that their wavelengths are three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This indicates that the quasar is moving away from us with a significant velocity. If we assume that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, then the relative speed of the quasar can be calculated using the Doppler equation: v = c * (1 - λ_rest / \lambda) where v is the relative speed, c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \lambda_rest and \lambda are the rest wavelengths and observed wavelengths respectively.

The oil layer floats on the surface and also refracts the light. The refraction index of oil (1.5) is higher than that of water (1.33), so the light will bend more when entering the oil layer.

The frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, and the speed of sound is 350 m/s. According to the Doppler effect, the frequency heard by the driver will be shifted upwards due to the relative motion between the source (the car) and the observer (the driver). The formula for this shift in frequency is: f = f0 * (v + v0)/(v - v0), where f0 is the original frequency, v is the speed of sound, and v0 is the relative velocity between the source and the observer. In this case, v = 3.5 m/s and v0 = -3.5 m/s (since the car is moving towards the wall). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: f = 600 * (350 + 3.5)/(350 - 3.5) = 612 Hz. Therefore, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to 612 Hz",-,"Let's reason step by step. The echo is simply a reflection of the original sound, so the driver should hear it at the same frequency of 600 Hz.

Since the car is moving towards the wall with a speed of 3.5 m/s and the speed of sound is 350 m/s, the Doppler shift will cause the perceived frequency to increase.

D,Let's reason step by step. Germanium is a semiconductor material that can be doped with impurities to create n-type or p-type semiconductors. The most common dopants used for n-type germanium are phosphorus (P) and arsenic (As). Sulfur (Sb) and boron (B) are not suitable as dopants for creating an n-type semiconductor in germanium.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Arsenic is in the same group as gallium and indium, which are known p-type dopants for germanium. Therefore, arsenic should also be a p-type dopant. Phosphorus (P) is a well-known n-type dopant for germanium. Antimony (Sb) is another common n-type dopant for germanium. Boron (B) is a p-type dopant for germanium. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The heat pump needs to extract 7\u00b0C of heat from the outdoor environment and deliver 27\u00b0C of heat indoors. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, we need to find the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump. We can calculate this by dividing the total heat required (27\u00b0C * 15,000 J) by the efficiency of the heat pump. The efficiency is typically around 300%, so we divide 27,000 J by 3 and get approximately 9,000 J. Therefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately 1,100 J.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The work done by the heat pump is the difference between the heat delivered indoors and the heat extracted outdoors. So, the work done should be 15,000 J - (15,000 J * (7/27)) = 11,111 J, which is approximately 500 J. Therefore, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a single-electron atom with l = 2, the quantum number m_l represents the magnetic quantum number and can take on values from -l to +l. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2. Therefore, there are 5 possible values for m_l.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The quantum number m_l can take on values from -l to +l, including 0. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which gives us a total of 2 values. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The fundamental frequency of an organ pipe is the lowest frequency that can be produced by the pipe when it is closed at one end and open at the other. To find the next higher harmonic, we need to multiply the fundamental frequency by a factor of 2. In this case, the fundamental frequency is 131 Hz, so the next higher harmonic would be 262 Hz (131 x 2).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The next higher harmonic is typically twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic should be 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz. So, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is a quantum mechanical system that obeys the principle of energy quantization. In thermal equilibrium, the average total energy of the oscillator can be calculated using the Boltzmann distribution formula. The average total energy of the oscillator is given by (3/2) k T, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the reservoir.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. A harmonic oscillator has one degree of freedom, so the average total energy should be (1/2)kT. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
