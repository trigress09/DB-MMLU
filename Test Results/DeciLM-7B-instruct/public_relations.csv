B,"Let's reason step by step. The BBC, or British Broadcasting Corporation, is a public broadcaster in the United Kingdom. It was founded on October 14, 1922, and began radio broadcasting on November 15, 1922. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The BBC was established in the early 20th century, so it's reasonable to assume that radio broadcasting began around 1917, shortly after its formation. However, we can eliminate options A and B since they are too early. Option D is also unlikely as it falls within the same year as the BBC's establishment. Therefore, the most probable answer is C: 1925.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The goal is to evaluate the impact of a campaign on audience attitudes. Among the options, analyzing pre and post sales reports for changes in sales (C) directly measures the effect of the campaign on sales, which are closely related to audience attitudes.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In issues management, the most proactive approach is to take control of the narrative and provide accurate information. Buying domain names or posting anonymous comments could be seen as defensive and potentially escalate the situation. Preparing a news release that discredits inaccurate information is a more effective way to address negative or misleading information posted online about your organization. Making policy changes to address complaints highlighted on these sites may not directly address the issue at hand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The quickest way to counteract misinformation is to issue a public statement that directly addresses and refutes the inaccuracies, thereby setting the record straight. This approach also helps to maintain transparency and accountability. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C

Public relations encompasses various communication strategies aimed at building relationships with the public, which aligns with the description of selling products and lifestyles. While advertising is a form of public persuasion, it focuses on specific products or services rather than general branding. Consumerism refers to the act of buying and consuming goods and services, but not necessarily through paid campaigns. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: public relations.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term that describes stakeholders who are unaware of their connection to an organization with respect to a particular issue is 'Latent Publics'. This is because they are not actively involved or aware of the issue, but could potentially become engaged if they were made aware of it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If stakeholders have no knowledge of their connection to the organization or the issue, they can be categorized as non-publics. Non-publics are individuals who are not directly involved in the organization but may still be affected by its actions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Non-publics.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The evaluation phase of public relations planning aims to measure the impact a program had on its stakeholders.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is 1993.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Persuasive advertising campaigns can be categorized into three basic types: product-oriented, person-oriented, and idea-oriented. The goal of these campaigns is to influence the target audience's behavior or opinion towards a specific product, person, or idea.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Libel is a legal term that refers to the publication of false information about someone, which damages their reputation. In order for someone to sue for libel, they must be able to prove that the statement was made with malicious intent or reckless disregard for the truth. Entities such as politicians, houses of worship, and government institutions can all potentially be sued for libel if the above conditions are met. However, publicly-traded companies cannot sue for libel because they are not individuals and do not have a reputation to protect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Houses of worship, as entities with reputations to uphold, should have the right to sue for libel if their image is tarnished by false statements. Government institutions can also sue for libel, as they are responsible for maintaining public trust and reputation. Publicly-traded companies can also sue for libel, as they are accountable to shareholders and investors. However, politicians cannot sue for libel, as they hold a unique position in society where they are not considered private individuals but rather representatives of the people.",A

Therefore, the statement 'A lawyer should be included in the team' is NOT true of a crisis management team.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The most crucial aspect of a crisis management team is the inclusion of a senior management representative to ensure effective decision-making and organizational oversight. Media relations training is also important, but not necessarily exclusive to this team.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The company paid for the photography and therefore owns the prints. However, the original contract between the company and the photographer is missing. Without this contract, it is difficult to prove ownership of the photos. Additionally, the photographer or his heirs own the copyright and must grant permission to reproduce the unpublished photographs. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The publisher is the one who will reprint the photos, so paying them a fee should grant the right to reproduce the photos.
