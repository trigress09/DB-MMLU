A,"Let's reason step by step. The general fertility rate is a measure of the average number of children born per woman in a population. Between 1964 and 2000, there were significant changes in social and economic factors that could have affected this rate. One such factor was the increase in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins (A). This is because women who marry later tend to have fewer children or delay having them until they are older. Another factor could be a decrease in the number of women of childbearing age, but this would not necessarily explain the entire decline (B). Errors in measurement and production of statistics (C) are unlikely to have such a widespread impact on fertility rates over such a long period. Finally, poverty, poor housing, and bad sanitation could lead to higher risks of diseases, which might affect fertility rates (D), but this is not the only factor at play here.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Poor living conditions and lack of access to healthcare can lead to higher infant mortality rates and discourage families from having more children.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Hakim (1995, 1996) argues that part-time jobs are done mainly by women because their choices are constrained by structural factors such as being unable to afford childcare. This is supported by the fact that full-time work is not available in the kinds of occupations they want to enter. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Women often end up in part-time work because the full-time jobs they aspire to in specific sectors are simply unavailable. This is due to structural factors such as lack of childcare options, which constrain their choices. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In the 1980s and 1990s, law and order was privatized through various means. One of these methods was the expansion of private security companies (A). Another method was the building of private prisons (B). Additionally, the introduction of market disciplines to measure police performance was also a factor (C). Therefore, all of the above options are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The privatization of law and order primarily involved the growth of private security firms taking over traditional policing roles. This was followed by the construction of private prisons to house inmates. Additionally, market-based performance measures were introduced for police departments, which further emphasized the shift towards a more privatized system. Therefore, all of the above options are correct.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. After slavery was abolished, former slaves were free to move around and seek opportunities in cities. However, they faced significant challenges due to racial discrimination, which made it difficult for them to assimilate or adapt into the new society. Discrimination was a major issue that prevented them from experiencing these outcomes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Policymakers expected former slaves to adapt to the existing social order in cities, adjusting their behaviors and customs. However, they faced discrimination due to racism and prejudice. Assimilation would have required a complete change of identity, which was not possible for most people. Compensation was not provided by the government at that time. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'discrimination'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Emotion work refers to the conscious management and presentation of emotions that are deemed appropriate for public settings of interaction. This process is not related to the work done by psychologists, counselors, or therapists (B), nor does it involve experiences such as grieving and falling in love (C). The term 'emotion work' was introduced by Hochschild in 1983 to describe this specific concept. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Emotion work refers to situations like grief or falling in love, where individuals expend significant emotional energy. It is not related to the techniques used for managing emotions (A), the work done by psychologists and therapists (B), or the way we think about our self-identities due to increased risk and anxiety (D).

D,"Let's reason step by step. Warner and Myrdal's claim is related to the experiences of black former slaves in North American cities. The most likely explanation for their reluctance to join the 'ethnic melting pot' is that they were not prepared to leave the Southern states and move to North America (C). This decision was influenced by a desire to retain a strong sense of their original ethnic identity (B) and the continued discrimination faced in the North American cities (D). However, the white population's beliefs about liberty, equality, and democracy did not directly impact this decision (A).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Former slaves primarily remained in the Southern states and couldn't easily relocate to North America due to geographical constraints. They also faced discrimination, which made them reluctant to join the 'ethnic melting pot'. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'secondary deviation' refers to the ways in which taking on a deviant role affects future action. This means that engaging in deviant behavior can lead to changes in one's behavior and decision-making processes, potentially leading to further deviance. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Secondary deviation is mainly about the societal response of punishing or stigmatizing individuals for deviant acts. It involves labeling an act as deviant through social reactions to it, and understanding how taking on a deviant role affects future action. So, all of the above options are correct.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. In the nineteenth century, scientific theories tried to explain race in naturalistic terms. Theories like genetics and evolution were considered as they attempted to explain human variation through biological factors. However, height and brain size were not considered as they are more closely related to physical characteristics rather than innate biological differences.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nineteenth-century scientific theories on race focused on social and cultural factors, so evolution wouldn't be a relevant consideration. Height and brain size are physical characteristics that could be used to categorize people, but they don't explain the origins of racial differences. Genetics, however, is a scientific theory that studies heredity and variation in living organisms, which was considered as an explanation for race in the nineteenth century.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The social construction of childhood refers to the ways in which society shapes and influences the experiences and understanding of childhood. While all four options have played a role, the most significant factor is likely the introduction of compulsory education (A). This event marked a major shift in how children were viewed and treated within society, as it required them to attend school at a certain age. The other options may also be relevant, but they are not as central to the social construction of childhood as the introduction of compulsory education.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The social construction of childhood primarily arose with the introduction of specialized products like children's clothing, toys, and books. These items were designed to cater specifically to the needs and interests of young children. This led to an increased emotional bond between parents and their offspring. Furthermore, compulsory education further reinforced this concept by providing structured learning environments for children. Therefore, all of the above options are correct in tracing back the social construction of childhood.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sociologists like Bordo (1993) have attributed the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to various factors. One factor is a generally ascetic, frugal lifestyle that can be taken to extremes. Another factor is traditional images of women as emotional, domesticated, and unassertive. Additionally, there is the social construction of mental illness, through which 'normal' patterns of behavior are pathologized. Lastly, there is the new ideal of independent, self-assured femininity, combined with cultural values of achievement and control. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a combination of A, B, C, and D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of anorexia stems from the tendency to label and pathologize certain eating patterns as mental illness, even if they fall within a normal range. This is known as the social construction of mental illness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Wirth (1938) was a sociologist who studied the urban way of life. He said that social relationships in this context were 'segmental' because people knew each other only through specific, situational roles and not as whole, rounded individuals. This means that there were distinctive patterns of activity for each social class. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wirth used 'segmental' to describe relationships limited to particular neighborhoods or districts within a city. This implies that people in urban areas interacted primarily with those who lived nearby, rather than having broader social connections across the entire city. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: they were confined to particular areas of the city.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1980s aimed to increase competition, efficiency, and accountability within the education system. This led to a shift from centralized control to decentralization, with local education authorities (LEAs) being given more power and budgetary control. However, this did not necessarily result in increased funding for students in higher education or an increase in parental choice of school. Instead, it focused on delegating power and budgetary control to LEAs. Additionally, there was a rise in state regulation through national testing and inspections. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Introducing market principles in education empowered local education authorities (LEAs) with greater budgetary control and decision-making. This led to a shift from centralized government funding to more decentralized LEA funding, which resulted in increased parental choice of schools.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Comprehensive schools were introduced in the 1960s to provide equal education opportunities for all students, regardless of their social background or class. However, they faced challenges in eradicating class inequalities due to various factors such as: (A) recruitment of pupils from inner cities and traditionally working-class areas; (B) selective schools still being able to 'cream off' the most able pupils while comprehensive schools put children into ability streams; (C) teachers using restricted code in the classroom, whereas working class pupils used elaborated codes of speech; and (D) national testing and league tables making the new schools highly competitive and selective. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a combination of these factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Comprehensive schools failed to eliminate class inequalities because of the intense competition fostered by national testing and league tables. These measures created a highly selective environment, where working-class pupils were often disadvantaged due to their limited access to resources and support. This led to an unequal distribution of educational opportunities and outcomes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Social norms are the unwritten rules and expectations that govern behavior in a society.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of a national curriculum in 1988 aimed to provide equal opportunities for both boys and girls in education. However, despite this effort, girls continued to face disadvantages. This is because subject choice remained gendered at A level and in higher education (A), boys received more attention from teachers in the classroom (B), and the hidden curriculum ensures that subjects like science are taught in gendered styles (C). Therefore, all of these factors contributed to the continued disadvantages faced by girls in education.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If girls were receiving less attention from teachers compared to boys, it would naturally hinder their learning and put them at a disadvantage.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Townsend's (1979) indicators of relative deprivation are based on material deprivation, which includes lack of basic amenities and services. Living in housing with serious structural defects and going without a week's holiday in the previous year are both examples of material deprivation. However, lacking exclusive use of a bath or shower and buying fewer than twenty DVDs in the previous year do not necessarily indicate material deprivation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Relative deprivation is about lacking basic necessities compared to the broader society, so living in a house with structural problems would certainly qualify. Similarly, not going on a week-long holiday could be seen as relative deprivation.

The demographic transition is a broader term that encompasses changes in population size, age structure, and composition. In this case, the most appropriate explanation for what is happening to Leroy's old neighborhood is gentrification.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The changes in Leroy's neighborhood suggest a pattern of 'white flight,' where white residents are leaving due to the increasing African American population. This leads to an influx of wealthier, non-African American residents who can afford the rising property values. As a result, the community is gentrifying and becoming more upscale. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'C' - White flight.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Conservative government of 1979 aimed to reduce the power of the labour movement through various strategies. Among these, making all strike action illegal was not a strategy used. This is because it would have been too extreme and could have caused widespread disruption in the economy. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Conservative government sought to limit the power of unions by prohibiting strikes that were motivated by political agendas rather than workplace issues. This strategy was not banning political strikes, but rather making them illegal if they were primarily concerned with worker conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The glass ceiling is a metaphorical term used to describe the invisible barrier that prevents women and minorities from advancing in their careers, despite having equal or better qualifications than their male counterparts.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Pierre Bourdieu was a French sociologist who proposed the concept of cultural reproduction, which refers to the transmission of social inequalities from one generation to another through various institutions and practices. Cultural capital is a key component of this process, as it encompasses the knowledge, skills, and values that individuals acquire throughout their lives. Therefore, Bourdieu attributed the reproduction of class to cultural capital.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bourdieu used the term 'cults of the capital' to describe groups within society that are fixated on accumulating wealth and achieving high social status. This concept is related to his theory of cultural reproduction, which suggests that class inequalities are maintained through the transmission of cultural values and practices from one generation to another. In this context, 'cults of the capital' can be seen as a manifestation of cultural capital, which refers to the non-material assets such as knowledge, skills, and social networks that individuals possess and use to navigate their social environment.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Cultural restructuring refers to the process of adapting cultural practices, values, and beliefs in response to changing social, economic, or political conditions. Regenerating cities in economic decline is an example of this, as it involves revitalizing urban areas that have lost their vitality due to economic factors. Turning industrial landscapes into tourist attractions is another way to restructure culture by transforming unappealing environments into destinations for leisure and entertainment. Selling sites and images through the 'symbolic economy' of media advertising is a third method, as it involves using media platforms to promote cultural heritage and attract visitors. Therefore, all of these options are correct answers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cultural restructuring primarily involves the commodification of sites and images through media advertising, where cultural elements are packaged and sold as products in the symbolic economy.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Totalitarian societies are characterized by a centralized government that controls all aspects of society, including the economy and information dissemination. This means they have one-party rule, indoctrination and propaganda, and no freedom of movement for citizens. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'freedom of movement for citizens' as it is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. One-party rule in a totalitarian society ensures freedom of movement for citizens as there is no opposition or dissent to challenge the ruling party's policies or control over the population. A centrally planned economy is also a characteristic, as it allows the government to exert complete control over all aspects of economic activity. However, indoctrination and propaganda are not necessarily characteristics of totalitarian societies, as they can be found in other types of authoritarian regimes as well.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sreberny-Mohammadi (1996) argues that national cultures can resist American cultural domination of the media by domesticating its content, including more 'home-produced' programmes. This means creating their own content to counteract the influence of foreign media. Additionally, they suggest controlling the distribution of imported products by banning satellite dishes and creating 'reverse flows' of their own programmes back to imperial societies. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. National cultures can effectively resist American cultural dominance in the media by implementing strict control over the distribution of imported media products, such as banning satellite dishes that provide access to foreign channels.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Mulholland (1998) argued that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers in that ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. This shift in ownership led to a change in the power dynamics within the company, as senior managers gained more control over production processes and decision-making. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Privatization led to a decrease in flexibility within companies as managers implemented detailed daily worksheets to closely monitor and control employee activities, leaving little room for individual autonomy or deviation from established procedures.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Berger & Luckmann's statement suggests that our understanding of reality is shaped by social factors and not solely based on objective truths. They argue that people negotiate shared definitions of their situation, often forgetting that these social worlds are not fixed and external. This aligns with option B, which states that ""people negotiate shared definitions of their situation and live according to these, often forgetting that these social worlds are not fixed and external."" Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When Berger and Luckmann stated that reality is socially constructed, they meant that sociologists have the authority to determine what constitutes social reality and then proceed to measure and analyze only those aspects that align with their predetermined definitions. This approach emphasizes the importance of subjective interpretation in shaping our understanding of reality. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vertical mobility refers to the movement of an individual from a lower social position to a higher one, while horizontal mobility refers to the movement within the same social position. Since the person gained a higher social position than they were born into, it means that they experienced vertical mobility. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Someone who experiences a change in social position, whether higher or lower than their birth position, has experienced absolute poverty, as their economic circumstances have shifted significantly.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Global tourism has a significant impact on various aspects of society, including the economy, culture, and environment. However, it does not directly lead to decreased rates of prostitution and sex tourism (A), as these activities are often associated with global tourism. Developing countries can depend on it as a crucial source of income (B) but this is not a consequence of global tourism itself. The exploitation of cheap, unregulated labour in poor countries (C) is an unfortunate reality that can be linked to global tourism, but it is not a direct consequence. Being more aware of 'other' societies and ways of living (D) is a positive outcome of global tourism, as it promotes cultural exchange and understanding.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Socialization is the process through which individuals learn the norms, values, and behaviors of a society. It involves both learning and adapting to the expectations of others within that society. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socialization primarily involves the formation of a strong emotional bond between an infant and its primary caregiver, usually the mother. This attachment is crucial for the child's development and well-being.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow (1978) argued that gender socialization occurred through the attachment of children to their primary caregivers. In this case, she suggested that boys were closely attached to their fathers and girls were closely attached to their mothers. However, as the children grew older, they began to break away from their primary caregivers and develop their own identities. This suggests that option C is the most accurate representation of Chodorow's argument.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow's theory emphasizes the process of girls developing their gender identity through a close attachment to their mothers, followed by a subsequent separation and individuation. This is in contrast to boys who are more closely attached to their fathers and experience less separation from them. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. The proportion of people living alone has fallen to 29%, which suggests that more people are choosing not to get married or are delaying marriage. Many people are cohabiting in long term relationships, indicating that they may be satisfied with their current situation and do not feel the need to marry. The upward curve of remarriages compensates for the drop in first marriages, but it does not explain why fewer people are getting married in the first place. Therefore, all of the above options contribute to the decline in marriage rates.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Despite the decline in first marriages, the overall marriage rate remains relatively stable due to the increasing trend of remarriages among divorced individuals.
