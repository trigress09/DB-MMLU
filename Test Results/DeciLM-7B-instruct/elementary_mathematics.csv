On Thursday, it gained $1.25, so the new price is $23.20 + $1.25 = $24.45. On Friday, it gained $4.75, so the new price is $24.45 + $4.75 = $29.20.

We can use the formula for finding the number of objects in a stack with a known height to find the number of pennies in Nick's stack. The equation that can be used is n = h * d, where n is the number of objects, h is the height of the stack, and d is the density of the object (in this case, 1 penny per centimeter).

D,"Let's reason step by step. There are 2 types of soup in Rolando's cupboard - tomato and chicken noodle. We know that 1/2 of the cans are tomato, which means there are 1/2 * total number of cans = 1/2 * 5 = <<1/2*5=2>>2 cans of tomato soup. Similarly, we know that 2/5 of the cans are chicken noodle, which means there are 2/5 * total number of cans = 2/5 * 5 = <<2/5*5=2>>2 cans of chicken noodle soup. So, the fraction of the cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle is (1/2 + 2/5) = 7/10 = <<(1/2+2/5)=7/10>>7/10. Therefore, the answer is 7-Mar.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The first number in the pattern is 28, and the rule is to add 14 to get the next number. If we apply this rule repeatedly, we can see that the numbers in the pattern are increasing by 14 each time. This means that the numbers in the pattern will be divisible by 14. However, since 14 is not a factor of 7, statement D cannot be true. Similarly, since 14 is not a factor of 8, statement C cannot be true either. Statement A can be eliminated because 28 is not divisible by 10. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that all the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 4.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pattern starts with 28 and involves adding 14, we can see that each subsequent number will be double the previous one, leading to a sequence of even numbers. This means that all the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 2.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Zelma buys p pounds of bananas for 40 cents per pound, which means she pays 40p cents in total. She pays the clerk with a twenty-dollar bill, so we need to find out how many cents that is. One dollar is equal to 100 cents, and there are 4 quarters in a dollar, so 20 dollars is equal to 80 quarters or 80 * 25 = 2000 cents. Now, let's subtract the total cost of the bananas from the twenty-dollar bill: 2000 - 40p = 1960 - 40p.

In this case, the total height is 185.9 feet and the height per story is 14.3 feet. So, we can calculate the number of stories as follows: 185.9 / 14.3 = 13.06. Since we cannot have a fraction of a floor, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding the building height to 180 feet and dividing by the height per story (14.3 feet), we get approximately 12.5, which rounds down to 12 floors.
