Autozygosity mapping deals with stretches of homozygous DNA, which are often found in individuals with X-linked recessive disorders due to inbreeding. This is because the inheritance pattern of these disorders follows an X-linked recessive pattern. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: X-linked recessive.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of heterozygotes is equal to the product of the frequencies of the two alleles. Since the incidence in males equals 1 in 100, we can assume that the frequency of the affected allele is 1/100. The frequency of the normal allele is then 1 - 1/100 = 99/100. The frequency of heterozygotes is (99/100) * (1/100) = 9.9%. To find the expected incidence of affected homozygous females, we multiply this by 2 since there are two copies of each allele in a diploid organism: 9.9% * 2 = 19.8%. However, since the question asks for the expected incidence in terms of the number of individuals, we need to convert it to a per-person basis by dividing by the total population size (which is not provided).

If the frequency of one allele is 0.6, then the frequency of the homozygous genotype for that allele would be 0.6 squared, which is 0.36. Since heterozygotes have one copy of each allele, their frequency should also be 0.36. However, since we are assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of heterozygotes must be equal to the product of the frequencies of the two alleles at the gene being studied. So, the frequency of heterozygotes is 0.6 x 0.4 = 0.24. To convert this into a percentage, we multiply by 100, which gives us 24%. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 0.32.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. Polydactyly refers to the presence of extra digits on a person's hands or feet, while arachnodactyly and brachydactyly are conditions related to the length of fingers or toes. Clinodactyly is a condition where the fingers or toes bend inward towards the palm or foot. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is polydactyly.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Arachnodactyly refers to finger abnormalities, and an extra digit is also a finger abnormality, so it must be the term for having an extra digit. In this case, the most appropriate answer is arachnodactyly.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. An X-linked recessive condition is a genetic disorder that affects males more frequently than females because the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, which males have only one copy of (XY), while females have two copies (XX). Since the frequency of affected males is .10, this means that 10% of the male population has the condition. To find the expected frequency of affected females, we need to consider that each female has two X chromosomes. Therefore, if one X chromosome carries the gene responsible for the condition and the other does not, the female will be a carrier but not affected. If both X chromosomes carry the gene, the female will be affected with the condition. Since there are twice as many females as males in the population, we can calculate the expected frequency of affected females by multiplying the frequency of affected males by 2 (since each female has two copies of the X chromosome). So, .10 x 2 = .20 or 20%. The closest answer to this is B: 0.001.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The frequency of affected males is 0.10, so the frequency of the recessive allele in the population is also 0.10. Squaring this gives us the expected frequency of affected females, which is 0.001. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by the inheritance of two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent. In this case, if both parents have the same autosomal recessive disorder, then each child has a 50% chance of inheriting one copy of the mutated gene from each parent. Since the probability of inheriting two copies is 1 in 4, the probability that each of their children will be affected equals 1 in 4.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both parents carry the recessive allele for the disorder, so there's a 1 in 4 chance that each child will inherit two copies of the recessive allele and be affected.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Multifactorial inheritance is a condition where the risk of developing a disease or trait depends on multiple genetic and environmental factors. Among the given options, Pyloric stenosis, Spina bifida (neural tube defects), and Marfan syndrome are known to have multifactorial inheritance patterns. Schizophrenia is also a complex condition with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Schizophrenia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pyloric stenosis has a strong genetic component, so it must follow a single-gene inheritance pattern rather than multifactorial inheritance. Schizophrenia is known to have a complex genetic background with multiple genes contributing to its development. Spina bifida (neural tube defects) is caused by the failure of the neural tube to close during fetal development, which can be influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue disorder that results from mutations in the FBN1 gene. Based on this information, we can conclude that Pyloric stenosis does not show multifactorial inheritance.",A
