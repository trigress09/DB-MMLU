However, cool to the touch is not a characteristic symptom of phlebitis. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) is directly proportional to the rate of energy expenditure (REE). Since 1 liter of O2 consumed produces approximately 4.8 kJ, we can calculate REE as follows: REE = VO2 x 4.8 kJ/L. Plugging in the given values, we get REE = 2 l/min x 4.8 kJ/L = 9.6 kJ/min. Since the answer choices are all multiples of 100 kJ/min, we can round up to the nearest multiple and find that the closest option is C: 80 kJ/min.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen consumption is related to energy expenditure, but the conversion is not very efficient, so an oxygen consumption of 2 L/min would translate to roughly 80 kJ/min of energy expenditure.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Central painful stimuli are those that cause pain in a specific area of the body, such as a muscle or nerve. The supra-orbital ridge pressure and sternal rub both involve direct pressure on sensitive areas, making them central painful stimuli. However, the little finger pulp is not a sensitive area, so pressure on it would not be considered a central painful stimulus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sternal rub involves applying pressure to the chest area, it's more likely to elicit a peripheral pain response rather than a central one. The other options involve direct pressure on specific body parts like the forehead (supra-orbital ridge), little finger pulp, and trapezius muscle, which are all closer to the brain and can potentially trigger central pain responses. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. When examining the jugular venous pulse, it is important to ensure that the patient's neck muscles are relaxed in order to avoid any interference with the pulsation. Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse and good lighting are also necessary for accurate examination. However, a patient lying at 45 degrees angle is not required as it does not affect the pulsation or the accuracy of the examination.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Clear visualization of the jugular venous pulse is crucial for accurate assessment, making good lighting a primary requirement. However, patient's neck muscles should be relaxed to avoid any interference with the pulse waveform. Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse and lying at 45 degrees angle are also important factors but not as essential as the others.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphocreatine to creatine and ADP to ATP in muscle cells. The activity of this enzyme is directly related to the concentration of intracellular ADP, which increases during exercise or when muscle pH falls below 6.9.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Haemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower rectum and anus, often caused by straining during bowel movements or pregnancy. Bleeding haemorrhoids can lead to melaena per rectum (PR), which is a black, tarry stool. Pregnancy is indeed a predisposing factor in causing haemorrhoids due to the increased pressure on the pelvic floor muscles. First degree haemorrhoids are usually painless, while second degree haemorrhoids can be returned to the anal canal through manual manipulation. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As haemorrhoids progress to more severe stages, they become increasingly difficult to return to their normal position within the anal canal. This is because second degree haemorrhoids are already protruding from the anus and have a higher risk of causing pain due to their proximity to sensitive nerve endings. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy source for muscle cells during high-intensity exercise. The amount of time it can supply energy depends on various factors, including the intensity and duration of the exercise. However, in general, the ATP store can only provide energy for about 10 seconds of high-intensity exercise before it needs to be replenished through cellular respiration or other metabolic processes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 10 seconds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high energy requirements of intense exercise, ATP stores can likely provide fuel for around 10 seconds before other energy systems become dominant. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a duration of 10 seconds.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. For very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is from phosphocreatine stores. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that can quickly release energy to power muscle contractions. This process is known as creatine phosphorylation.

Palmitic acid is a fatty acid, not an amino acid. Glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and glutamine are all amino acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acids are organic compounds with acidic properties, so any molecule with 'acid' in its name, like glutamic acid, must be an amino acid. However, palmitic acid is a fatty acid and not an amino acid. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Peak flow readings are used to monitor asthma symptoms and track the effectiveness of treatment. For patients with asthma, it is recommended that peak flow readings be taken at least twice a day for optimal monitoring and management.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Peak flow readings help monitor lung function in asthma patients, and daily monitoring should be sufficient to track any significant changes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'Daily.'",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Water is a common choice for bladder washout in secondary care, but it can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to the presence of minerals and other substances found in tap water. This can cause discomfort or even harm to the patient. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using water for bladder washout might cause fluid to bypass the intended area, leading to an unsuccessful procedure. This could result in a risk of electrolyte imbalance due to dilution of urine. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A catheter valve is a medical device used for controlling the flow of urine in patients with bladder dysfunction or post-operative conditions. In this case, we need to consider whether the patient has bladder sensation or not. If they do have bladder sensation, then using a catheter valve would be unnecessary as it can cause discomfort and irritation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Catheter valves control urine flow, so they wouldn't be suitable if urine output needs to be measured accurately. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pain at IV site, erythema, and swelling are all signs of inflammation. Inflammation is a part of the body's response to injury or infection. Phlebitis is an inflammatory condition that affects veins. The phlebitis scale has five stages, with stage 0 being no symptoms and stage 5 being severe damage to the vein. Since we have pain at IV site, erythema, and swelling, this indicates a more advanced stage of phlebitis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Stage 3 - re-site cannula and consider treatment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pain, erythema, and swelling at the IV site are early signs of phlebitis, so the cannula should be observed for further developments before taking action. Therefore, the correct answer is Stage 1 - observe cannula.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body requires more energy and glucose is a primary source of fuel for muscles. As a result, blood glucose concentration may rise to meet the increased demand. However, this increase is typically modest (1 - 3 mM) and not significant enough to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels, and during exercise, glucose uptake by muscles is balanced by glucose release from the liver, so blood glucose concentration should remain relatively unchanged. However, intermittent high-intensity exercise can cause a temporary increase in blood glucose due to muscle contraction and increased insulin secretion. So, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Water has a pH of around 7, which is the same as pure water. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A pH of 7 is neutral, and water is a very strong substance, so it must have a high pH. The most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. When recording a peak flow rate, it is important to maintain best lung expansion for accurate and consistent readings. Standing or sitting upright allows for optimal lung expansion, ensuring the most reliable results. This position also makes it easier for the patient to perform the test correctly and be observed easily.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's important for the healthcare professional to have a clear view of the patient's breathing technique to ensure they're doing it correctly. Standing or sitting upright allows them to observe and assess the patient's posture, which can impact their ability to perform the test accurately. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Short-acting bronchodilators are used to treat acute asthma attacks and other respiratory conditions. They work quickly to dilate the airways, allowing better deposition of other medications. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Medications are often color-coded to indicate the order they should be taken, so the short-acting bronchodilator should be taken first because it's likely a different color. The other options don't provide any relevant information about why the short-acting bronchodilator should be taken first.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Psoriatic arthropathy, also known as psoriatic arthritis, is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects people with psoriasis. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of certain symptoms and signs, such as nail pitting (D), tophi (C) over affected joints, and the absence of plaques of psoriasis (A). However, a blood marker is not typically used for the diagnosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Psoriatic arthropathy is a type of inflammatory arthritis, and gout is also inflammatory, so tophi could be present in both conditions. However, the presence of plaques of psoriasis is not necessary for the diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy. The blood marker Rheumatoid factor (RF) can be elevated in both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthropathy, but it's not specific to either condition. Nail pitting may give a clue to the diagnosis of psoriasis, but it is not exclusive to psoriatic arthropathy. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the anterior neck to create an opening into the trachea, which allows for easier access to the airway. The correct answer should describe the location of this opening. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea below the cricoid cartilage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped structure, and rings are usually found on the back of things, so the tracheostomy must be on the posterior wall below the cricoid cartilage. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Morphine is an opioid analgesic that primarily acts on the central nervous system to reduce pain perception. Among the given options, only B and D describe effects of morphine that are consistent with its known actions. However, option B is more accurate as it describes both pain reduction and sedation, which are well-known side effects of morphine. Therefore, the best description of the effects of morphine is B: Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If morphine reduces pain, it would make the patient feel better and more energetic, so it should also increase alertness. However, if it causes sedation, it means that the patient feels drowsy or sleepy. Diarrhoea and insomnia are not directly related to pain relief, so they can be eliminated as possible effects. Therefore, the best answer is B: Reduces pain intensity but also causes sedation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. ADP degradation is a process that occurs during multiple sprint sports. The products of this degradation are ammonia, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. ADP is used for energy, and urea is a waste product of energy metabolism, so it makes sense that urea would increase along with ammonia and uric acid during intense exercise. However, creatinine is not a product of ADP degradation, but rather a breakdown product of creatine phosphate, which is used for short bursts of energy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Ammonia, urea and uric acid.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In high intensity exercise, the body requires a constant supply of energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). When the demand for ATP exceeds its production rate, fatigue occurs. This is because the body cannot keep up with the energy requirements during intense physical activity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. ATP is the energy currency of the cell, so any inhibition of its production would naturally lead to fatigue during exercise. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A keloid is a raised, firm mass of scar tissue that occurs when the body produces too much collagen during the healing process. It is not directly related to infection or drain removal. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: a firm mass of scar tissue.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Keloids are scars, and scars form when wounds heal improperly, so removing a drain too soon could disrupt healing and lead to a keloid. A keloid is a firm mass of scar tissue, which matches option B. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cyanosis is a condition where the skin and mucous membranes turn blue due to lack of oxygen in the bloodstream. This indicates that the patient's oxygen saturation level is low, meaning they are not getting enough oxygen from their lungs. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option C: 80% or below.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cyanosis means the patient isn't getting enough oxygen, but 94% saturation is still quite high, so they wouldn't be cyanosed. The most likely answer is that their oxygen saturation level would be 80% or below.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Eccrine and apocrine glands are both types of sweat glands, which are responsible for producing sweat to help regulate body temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eccrine and apocrine glands are located near the eyes and face, similar to tear ducts, so they might be related. However, their primary function is to produce sweat, which is a different process than producing tears. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that both eccrine and apocrine glands are types of sweat glands.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Lipidation, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, glycosylation, and phosphorylation are all processes used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred. However, lipidation is not a process that modifies the protein structure directly. It involves adding fatty acid chains to proteins, which can affect their function but does not change the primary sequence of amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lipidation sounds like it involves adding lipids, which are similar to amino acids, so it could be a way to modify protein structure by adding more building blocks. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is the process that occurs during translation, so it's not used after translation. Glycosylation involves attaching sugar molecules to proteins, which can change their shape and function. Phosphorylation adds a phosphate group to a protein, changing its activity or location within the cell. Therefore, lipidation is the only process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Graves Disease of the thyroid is an autoimmune disorder that causes overactivity of the thyroid gland. This can lead to various symptoms, including ophthalmoplegia (eye muscle weakness), a large multi-nodular goitre (enlarged thyroid gland), and in some cases, 'Derbyshire Neck' (a swelling at the base of the neck). However, Graves Disease is more common in females than males. Therefore, the most accurate statement among the given options is that it causes ophthalmoplegia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Autoimmune diseases often affect men more than women, and Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition, so it's likely more common in males. Graves' disease can cause a large multi-nodular goitre, which is a swelling of the thyroid gland. In the past, Grave's disease sometimes caused 'Derbyshire Neck', which was a visible swelling of the neck due to enlarged lymph nodes. However, this symptom is less common nowadays. So, the most accurate answer is B: It causes a large multi-nodular goitre.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a substance is completely oxidised in the body, it releases energy. Among the given options, glucose and palmitic acid are both carbohydrates that can be broken down to release energy. However, leucine and alcohol are amino acids and an organic compound respectively, which do not directly release energy when oxidised. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is one gram of glucose (A).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Leucine is an amino acid, and protein provides energy, so leucine must release a lot of energy when oxidized. Glucose and palmitic acid are also sources of energy, but they do not release as much energy as leucine does. Alcohol is a source of energy, but it releases less energy than leucine does.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a tool used to assess the level of consciousness and neurological function in patients with head injuries or other brain disorders. It consists of three categories: eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response. Therefore, pupil response is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses neurological function, and pupil response is a key indicator of neurological status, so it should be included in the scale. Eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response are all categories used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy currency for all forms of muscle contraction. It is produced through a process called oxidative phosphorylation, where ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphocreatine are used as intermediates.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is ATP.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The optimum position for performing CPR is to position the patient in a way that allows for effective chest compressions and ventilations. A semi-recumbent posture, as mentioned in option A, is ideal because it allows for easy access to the chest and lungs while maintaining proper airway alignment. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During CPR, it's important for the patient to be comfortable, and a semi-recumbent position is often more comfortable than lying flat. This position also allows for better access to the chest and airway, which are essential components of effective CPR. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Blackouts and dizziness are symptoms that can be caused by various factors, including low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), dehydration, stress, or even epileptic fits. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D, as a blood sugar estimation is of no value in investigating blackouts and dizziness.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Blackouts and dizziness are usually related to neurological issues, so checking blood sugar wouldn't provide any useful information. Confusion following a blackout can be suggestive of a fit, but it is not always the case. Pre-syncope is another term for a blackout, which means a sudden drop in blood pressure and may cause dizziness or fainting. An epileptic fit does not always lead to loss of consciousness, as some people may remain conscious during a seizure. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: Pre-syncope is another term for a blackout.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A palpable median groove in the prostate is an adverse finding because it indicates enlargement of the prostate, which may lead to urinary symptoms and other complications. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour, but this is not always true as there are other conditions that can cause similar findings. A thrombosed haemorrhoid is usually painful due to the inflammation and swelling of the blood vessel. Peri-anal warts can be demonstrated on proctoscopy, which is an examination of the rectum and anus using a scope.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A groove in the prostate doesn't sound normal, so it's likely an adverse finding that requires further investigation. Impacted faeces can indeed be mistaken for a rectal tumour, but this is not necessarily true for all cases. Thrombosed haemorrhoids are often painful and require medical attention. Peri-anal warts can be seen on proctoscopy, but they may also present as a lump or mass in the anal region.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rise in respiratory rate, noisy breathing, and increase in the use of accessory muscles are all signs of increased work of breathing. However, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute is within the normal range for an adult at rest, so it does not indicate an increase in the work of breathing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Using accessory muscles means the body is working harder to breathe, which suggests a higher capacity for air intake. Rise in respiratory rate and noisy breathing are both indicators of increased work of breathing. A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute is within normal range and does not necessarily indicate an increase in the work of breathing.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are essential for muscle growth and repair. Increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. Creatine supplements can also increase muscle strength and power. However, amino acid supplements are more comprehensive in their effects on muscle growth and power. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage occurs when the muscle is contracting and shortening under a load, as in a bicep curl exercise. This causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibers, which then repair themselves stronger than before. Therefore, D is true.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a nucleic acid that plays an important role in the biological processes of cells, such as protein synthesis and gene expression. It consists of four different types of nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). However, thymine (T) is not found in RNA; instead, it is found in DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Adenine is a nucleotide base that pairs with thymine in DNA, so it is not found in RNA. Uracil and guanine are the two nucleotide bases found in RNA. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Back pain is indeed a common complaint, but it doesn't necessarily mean that back pain is an uncommon complaint. Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine, which is related to spinal mobility. Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine, meaning it reduces spinal mobility. Pregnancy is not directly related to loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy, the woman's center of gravity shifts forward, which leads to a loss of the natural lordosis of the lumbar spine. This is due to the increased weight and size of the uterus. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. When developing a plan of care relating to the management of pain, it is essential to address both physical and psychological needs of the patient. This ensures that the treatment plan is comprehensive and addresses all aspects of their condition. Additionally, regular reassessment is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of the treatment plan and making necessary adjustments as needed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. ATP and phosphocreatine are high-energy phosphates that provide energy for muscle contractions during exercise. The amount of energy they release can be estimated based on the duration of maximal exertion exercise. Since ATP has a relatively short half-life (~3 seconds), it cannot sustain prolonged exercise. Phosphocreatine, on the other hand, has a longer half-life (~10 seconds) and can provide energy for up to 50-60 seconds of maximal exertion exercise. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides a rapid burst of energy, sufficient to sustain maximal exertion for approximately 30-40 seconds. This is because the high-energy phosphates are quickly depleted after this time period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In a sensory assessment of the arm, we need to test various modalities such as pain, light touch, proprioception, and vibration sense. The question asks which of these is true in this context. A venepuncture needle is not appropriate for testing pain, as it can cause harm. Proprioception is appreciated via different tracts than light touch. Vibration sense is best tested with a 256 Hz tuning fork. Impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To accurately assess the sensation of pain in the arm, a sharp stimulus like a venepuncture needle can be used to evoke a clear response. Proprioception is not tested via light touch but rather through joint position sense and muscle contraction.

D,"Let's reason step by step. DNA is a double-stranded molecule composed of two complementary strands, each made up of nucleotides. The four main types of nucleotides are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Purines and pyrimidines are the two classes of nitrogenous bases found in DNA. Deoxyribose is a sugar that forms part of the backbone of DNA. Amino acids, on the other hand, are organic compounds that make up proteins. Therefore, the molecule that does not form part of DNA is an amino acid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Purines, like amino acids, are nitrogen-containing compounds involved in building biological molecules, so it's logical that they would also be part of DNA structure. Pyrimidine is another important component of DNA, but deoxyribose is the sugar that forms the backbone of DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Amino acid.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The normal respiratory rate for an adult male is typically between 12 and 20 breaths per minute, with an average of around 15 breaths per minute.

C,"Let's reason step by step. An intention tremor is an involuntary shaking or trembling that occurs when attempting to perform voluntary movements, such as writing or drawing. This type of tremor is typically worse at rest and not during movement. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including Parkinson's Disease, but it is not always indicative of this specific disease. A cerebellar lesion (damage to the cerebellum) can also cause intention tremors. Dyscalculia, which is difficulty with mathematical calculations, is not directly associated with intention tremors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Intention tremor, as the name suggests, is related to intentional movement, so it would be most noticeable and worse at rest, similar to the tremors seen in Parkinson's disease. This makes option A the least likely choice. Dyscalculia (difficulty with numbers) is not directly associated with intention tremor. Therefore, options B, C, and D are all possible answers. However, a cerebellar lesion is a specific type of brain damage that can cause intention tremors. So, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A mercury sphygmomanometer measures blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). An aneroid sphygmomanometer, on the other hand, uses a diaphragm to measure blood pressure and is not calibrated in mmHg. Therefore, the smallest increments on an aneroid sphygmomanometer are not directly comparable to those on a mercury sphygmomanometer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), so it makes sense that the smallest increments on a sphygmomanometer would be 1 mmHg for precise readings. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. In all-out exercise such as sprinting, the first fibre types to fatigue are those that rely on anaerobic metabolism for energy production. Type I and II fibres are aerobic while type III fibres are anaerobic. Among these, type II fibres are further divided into two subtypes: IIa and IIb. The first to fatigue in all-out exercise are the type IIa fibres. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During intense exercise, muscle fibers fatigue in a specific order based on their properties. Since Type IIa fibers are intermediate between Type I and Type IIX, they would naturally fatigue first before the more powerful Type IIX fibers.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the body's ability to produce or use insulin, leading to high blood sugar levels. This can lead to various complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease, and eye problems. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B, as unstable blood sugar levels increase the risk of urinary tract infections.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Diabetes can affect fluid balance and kidney function, so patients with diabetes might experience increased urination and have clearer urine as a result. This is because their bodies are trying to excrete excess glucose through the urine. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A thyroid swelling can be caused by various factors, including inflammation, cysts, or nodules. The statement 'It always elevates on swallowing' is not true for all types of thyroid swellings. Lymph node enlargement is a good prognostic sign in some cases but not necessarily in all. An ultrasound of the swelling can help determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone, but it may not be the best test to determine if the nodule is functioning or not. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer, but this statement does not directly address the question about a thyroid swelling.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lymph node enlargement indicates an active immune response, which is generally a good sign in fighting off diseases, including cancer. An ultrasound of the swelling is indeed the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. However, it does not necessarily mean that the nodule is functioning or non-functioning. A functioning nodule on isotope scanning is unlikely to be due to cancer, but this information alone cannot confirm if the swelling is a thyroid swelling.",B

As of 2020 medical knowledge, the most appropriate size for a rapid blood transfusion is a 18 gauge cannula.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In cannula sizes, a lower gauge number indicates a larger diameter, so for a rapid blood transfusion, a 24-gauge cannula would allow for faster flow compared to smaller sizes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The creatine kinase reaction is an enzymatic process that converts ADP to ATP, which is a crucial energy source for cells. This reaction is reversible, meaning it can go both ways depending on the cell's energy needs. It is not slow compared with glycolysis, as they are two different metabolic pathways. The creatine kinase reaction is not activated until all the ATP has been used up, as this enzyme is responsible for regenerating ATP from ADP. Lastly, low pH in the muscle does not inhibit the creatine kinase reaction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Many enzymatic reactions in metabolism are irreversible to ensure a unidirectional flow of energy and metabolites, so the creatine kinase reaction likely follows the same principle. However, we can't determine if it is slow compared with glycolysis or not activated until all ATP has been used up without more information. Lastly, low pH in the muscle would inhibit many enzymatic reactions but not necessarily this one specifically.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen is a crucial component in cellular respiration, which generates energy for the body. In the context of these options, we can see that A and D are related to glucose metabolism (glycolysis and glycogenolysis), while B and C are related to fatty acid metabolism (conversion of fatty acids to acetyl CoA and tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively). Since the question is about oxygen usage in general, the most appropriate answer would be C: in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration, and glycolysis is the first step in breaking down glucose for energy production, so oxygen must be used in this initial stage.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Systemic Sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is an autoimmune disease that affects connective tissues such as the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. It primarily affects women, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 9:1. Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels) can be seen in some patients but is not specific to Systemic Sclerosis. Arachnodactyly (long fingers and toes) is a feature of Marfan syndrome, not Systemic Sclerosis. Patients with Systemic Sclerosis may have a beaked-shaped nose and waxy skin, but these features are not exclusive to the disease. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C: Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Systemic Sclerosis affects connective tissues and can cause joint deformities, so arachnodactyly, with its characteristic finger appearance, could be a feature of the disease. In addition, patients may have waxy skin and a beaked nose. However, it does not affect males more than females or rely on telangiectasia for diagnosis. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. An allele that is masked means it is not expressed or visible in the phenotype, but still present in the genome. This occurs when another allele at the same locus has a dominant effect on the trait being studied. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'recessive.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. A masked allele is not expressed because its effect is suppressed or inhibited, similar to how gene repression prevents a gene from being active. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'repressed.'",C
D,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Maximal dynamic exercise refers to the highest intensity of physical activity an individual can perform for a certain period of time. Aerobic exercises are those that rely on oxygen to produce energy, and they typically involve large muscle groups working together in a sustained manner. The transition from predominantly anaerobic (non-oxygen dependent) to aerobic exercise occurs when the body starts relying more heavily on oxygen for energy production. This usually happens after about 1 minute of intense physical activity. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Initially, the body relies on anaerobic energy pathways for short bursts of activity. Within 10 seconds, the aerobic system kicks in and becomes the dominant energy source as oxygen supply meets the demand. However, after this initial period, the body transitions to a predominantly aerobic metabolism. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 30 seconds.",B

The measurement is taken at the peak of the exhalation, which is when the airflow rate is highest. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peak flow meters assess lung function by measuring the forced expiratory volume in one second, indicating how much air can be forcefully exhaled. This measurement is important for monitoring and managing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: forced expiratory volume.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It has four chambers in total, two atria and two ventricles. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B, as it correctly states that the heart has four valves and four chambers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The heart is a relatively simple pump with two chambers, one for receiving blood and one for pumping it out, and two valves to control the flow. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that the heart has two valves and four chambers.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nociceptive pain is defined as pain that results from actual or potential tissue damage. This type of pain initiates when chemical mediators are released, which stimulate nerve fibers to send pain signals to the brain. Therefore, option A best describes nociceptive pain.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nociceptive pain arises from pressure or compression on a nerve or group of nerves, triggering pain signals that are sent to the brain. This is different from other types of pain such as tissue damage or disorders of the central nervous system. Therefore, the best description for nociceptive pain would be option B: Pain resulting from pressure upon a nerve or group of nerves.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cannulas are used for administering fluids or medications intravenously, and they can become clogged with blood clots or other debris over time. Flushing the cannula helps to remove these obstructions and maintain proper flow of fluids or medication. In general, it is recommended to flush a cannula every 12 hours to ensure optimal performance and prevent complications. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cannulas are prone to clogging, especially with medications, so frequent flushing every 16 hours is necessary to maintain patency. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a cannula being flushed every 16 hours.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen ions are formed when an acid is produced. In the context of glycogen depletion, phosphocreatine breakdown, pyruvate conversion to lactate, and glycolysis being used as a major means of resynthesising ATP, only one option involves an acid being produced: pyruvate is converted to lactate. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. When pyruvate is converted to lactate, a hydrogen ion is released as part of the process, contributing to the acidity in the muscle. This is known as the lactic acid cycle or anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are synthetic compounds designed to selectively modulate the activity of androgen receptors in the body, mimicking the effects of natural testosterone. They are non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors mimicking the effects of natural steroid hormones.",C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs act on androgen receptors, but instead of mimicking androgens, they compete with them and block their effects, leading to reduced androgenic activity. This makes them non-steroid drugs that act on androgen receptors inhibiting the effects of natural steroid hormones.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A pleural friction rub is a crackling sound caused by irritation or inflammation of the pleura, which are the thin membranes surrounding the lungs. The most common cause of this sound is due to a fluid buildup between the pleura and the lung tissue. Among the given features, 'More prominent in expiration' and 'Alters with coughing' suggest that it is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles. However, 'No pain over the area' and 'Clubbing' are not specific enough to distinguish between the two conditions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Clubbing is often seen in conditions with chronic hypoxia, which can also affect the pleura and lead to inflammation and friction rubs. However, clubbing is not a feature of pleural friction rubs specifically. The other features listed are more likely to be associated with pleural friction rubs: more prominent in expiration (due to increased airflow), alters with coughing (as the rub can change with changes in breathing), and no pain over the area (since it is a mechanical sound rather than a painful one). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, which can then be used for energy production. The rate limiting enzyme in this process is responsible for controlling the speed at which glycolysis occurs. In this case, phosphofructokinase is the correct answer as it controls the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, a key step in glycolysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pyruvate dehydrogenase plays a crucial role in regulating the flow of metabolites through glycolysis, making it the rate-limiting enzyme. In this case, the most appropriate answer is pyruvate dehydrogenase.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline is a hormone that increases heart rate and blood pressure, but it does not directly affect gastric motility. Ditropan is an anticholinergic drug used to treat overactive bladder, which can indirectly improve gastric motility. Erythromycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections and has no direct effect on gastric motility. Carbemazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that does not affect gastric motility. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine affects the nervous system, and its modulation of nerve signals can indirectly influence gastric motility, potentially enhancing it. Adrenaline is a hormone that increases heart rate and blood pressure, but not directly related to gastric motility. Ditropan is an anticholinergic drug used for urinary incontinence, not specifically targeting gastric motility. Erythromycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not directly affecting gastric motility. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Carbamazepine.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood clots are a common cause of catheter blockages, which can lead to serious complications if not addressed promptly. In this situation, the most appropriate action is to inform medical staff immediately so they can take necessary measures to prevent further complications and ensure patient safety. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has the right to know about any complications, so informing them about the blood clots should be the first step before taking further action. In this case, the most appropriate answer is to inform the patient.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine resynthesis is a process that occurs during recovery from exercise and involves the conversion of creatine phosphate back into ATP. This process requires oxygen to function properly. An excess of oxygen can lead to hyperventilation, which can cause a lack of oxygen in the body. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: a lack of oxygen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperventilation leads to excessive elimination of carbon dioxide, which can disrupt the acid-base balance and indirectly impair oxygen utilization, affecting phosphocreatine resynthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is hyperventilation.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Blood pressure is typically measured at the level of the heart, as this provides the most accurate reading. When measuring above the heart, the blood volume in the veins increases due to gravity, causing a temporary increase in blood pressure. This leads to an overestimation of the actual blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is B: overestimate the blood pressure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When the arm is above the heart level, gravity would cause blood to pool in the arm, leading to an overestimation of blood pressure. This phenomenon is known as the 'Auscultatory Gap'. So, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a double-stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines (Adenine and Guanine) to pyrimidines (Cytosine and Thymine) is not always 1:1. The ratio can vary depending on the specific sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is A: variable.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA can pair in different combinations, so the ratio can vary depending on the specific sequence of the DNA molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is A: variable.",A
