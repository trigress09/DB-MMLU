A balanced binary search tree has a height that is logarithmic in the number of nodes, so finding and removing the 7th largest element also takes O(log n) time in the worst case.

This is because the sign bit of -42 is set to 1, which when added to the sum of 109 results in a carry of 1. Since there are only 8 bits available, this carry cannot be represented and the result would overflow. In two's complement representation, the addition of 109 and -42 within range is possible because the sign bit of -42 is set to 1, which when added to the sum of 109 results in a carry of 0. This carry can be represented within the 8 bits available. In sign and magnitude representation, the addition of 109 and -42 within range is also possible because the sign bit of -42 is set to 1, which when added to the sum of 109 results in a carry of 0. This carry can be represented within the 8 bits available. Therefore, all three representations are valid for this addition.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Two's complement is only used for representing positive numbers, while one's complement and sign and magnitude can represent both positive and negative numbers. Therefore, only one's complement and sign and magnitude representations can accommodate the addition of 109 and -42 within the range of an 8-bit word. The correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The average completion time is calculated by adding up the service times of all jobs and dividing it by the number of jobs. In this case, the total service time is 25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 45 time units. Dividing this by the number of jobs (5) gives us 45/5 = 9 time units per job. Therefore, the minimum value of the average completion time is 9 time units.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To minimize the average completion time, we should prioritize the jobs with shorter service times. The average completion time is then calculated by adding the service times and dividing by the number of jobs: (25 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 2) / 5 = 50 / 5 = 10. Therefore, the minimum value of the average completion time is 10.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Busy-waiting on an asynchronous event can lead to inefficient use of resources, especially if the wait is expected to be long or there are other tasks that could be executed during this time. A busy-wait loop is not a reasonable justification for choosing to busy-wait because it can cause unnecessary CPU usage and potential deadlocks. The program executes on a time-sharing system, which means multiple processes share the same resources, so there will always be other work for the processor to do.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If there is no other work for the processor to do, it's efficient to keep it busy by waiting for the asynchronous event instead of switching to another task and then back. This reduces context switching overhead. However, if the wait is expected to be short, busy-waiting may not be necessary since it can cause unnecessary CPU usage. Similarly, if there is no other work for the processor to do, a busy-wait loop is easier to code than an interrupt handler. Lastly, the program executes on a time-sharing system, which means that multiple processes share the same CPU. In this case, busy-waiting may not be necessary since the OS can handle switching between tasks efficiently.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. In order for two expressions to be unifiable, they must have the same variables with the same values. In this case, we need to find pairs of expressions that share at least one variable and have the same value for that variable.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In two's complement representation, the most significant bit (MSB) is used to indicate the sign of a number.

An isolated vertex is a vertex that has neither an incoming nor an outgoing edge. Since the number of edges in G is greater than 0, there must be at least one vertex with either an incoming or an outgoing edge. Therefore, I and II are true. However, III cannot be true because if there were an isolated vertex, it would have no incoming or outgoing edges, which contradicts the fact that G has at least one edge.

Since the graph is acyclic, there can be no cycles, meaning there must be at least one vertex that doesn't have an outgoing edge to prevent a circular path. Therefore, either G has a vertex with no incoming edge (I) or it has a vertex with no outgoing edge (II). However, if both I and II are true, then the graph would contain a cycle, which contradicts the acyclic property.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A strictly binary tree is a type of binary tree where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The height h of any such tree can be calculated as the maximum number of edges from the root to any leaf in the tree. Since the ratio of the lengths of any two root-to-leaf paths is bounded above by c, this means that the height h of any tree in this class is less than or equal to the logarithm base 2 of N (the number of nodes in the tree). Therefore, the best characterization for the height h of any tree in this class is A: h <= log2(N).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The ratio of path lengths is bounded by c, so the height of the tree should be proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes, with c as the proportionality constant.

The Boolean formula I and III is the only one that includes both AND and OR operations, making it the correct answer.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mergesort is an efficient sorting algorithm that works by splitting a list into two halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the sorted halves together. This process allows for a time complexity of O(n log n). In order to achieve this efficiency, we need a data structure that supports efficient splitting and merging operations. A singly linked list does not support efficient splitting and merging, so it cannot be used with Mergesort. A doubly linked list can support efficient splitting and merging, but it is not as efficient as an array. An array allows for easy access to elements at any index, making it possible to split and merge the list efficiently. Therefore, the correct answer is III only.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Merging two sorted lists efficiently requires random access to elements, which is only possible with arrays, not linked lists. Therefore, the data structure that allows mergesort to work in O(n log n) time is an array (III).",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The recursive definition of T(n) is given as T(1) = 7 and T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n). This means that the function grows linearly with n, since each term after the first adds a constant value to the previous one. Therefore, the order of growth of T(n) is \u0398(n), which corresponds to answer A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The recursive calls within the function definition suggest a logarithmic factor, leading to an overall order of growth of O(n^2 log n). Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Condition codes set by every instruction can cause branch mispredictions, leading to stalls and increased latency. Variable-length encoding of instructions can increase the complexity of decoding and result in longer pipelining delays. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can also lead to pipeline stalls. However, several different classes (sets) of registers do not necessarily cause obstacles to aggressive pipelining as they only affect register allocation and management.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Variable-length instructions require additional processing to determine their boundaries and align them properly, hindering efficient pipelining. Condition codes set by every instruction can be handled efficiently using a conditional branch prediction mechanism. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can also be handled effectively through dynamic scheduling techniques. However, multiple classes (sets) of registers can lead to increased complexity in register allocation and spilling, which may negatively impact aggressive pipelining.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The hash table is used to store the status of each word in the dictionary, where true means the word was found in the dictionary and false means it wasn't. When checking spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. This process determines if the word is in the dictionary or not. Therefore, both I and II are correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking. However, the size of the hash table does not necessarily need to increase with document size because it depends on the number of words in the dictionary and not the size of the document. Therefore, the correct answer is C: I and II only.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions are executed for each signal digitized, and ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. Therefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is 1.6 microseconds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. So, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates is 12 microseconds.",A
