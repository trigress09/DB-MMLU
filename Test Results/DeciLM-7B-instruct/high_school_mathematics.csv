C,"Let's reason step by step. The first quadrant region is bounded by the x-axis, y = x^2, and y = cos(x). To find the area of this region, we need to integrate from 0 to pi/4 over the function f(x) = x^2 - cos(x). Using integration by parts, we get A = (1/3) * (pi/4)^3 - (1/6) * (pi/4)^2 + C.

We can find the length of one side by taking the absolute difference between these two points' x-coordinates and y-coordinates. The absolute difference between 1 and 7 is 6, and the absolute difference between 2 and 4 is also 2. So, the length of one side is √(6^2 + 2^2) = √36 + 2 = √40.

To find her sixth attempt time, we need to find the middle value between 86 and 94 (since there are an even number of attempts). The middle value is 89, so Sarah's sixth attempt time must be slightly lower than that. Since 92 is the closest option, it is likely her time for the sixth attempt.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To get a median of 92, we need the sum of all six times to be 92 multiplied by 6, which is 552. Adding the sixth time should bring the sum to this value. We know that Sarah achieved times of 86, 94, 97, 88 and 96 for her previous five attempts. Therefore, we can calculate the sixth time as follows: 552 - (86 + 94 + 97 + 88 + 96) = 10.

Option A has a difference of 3 between the longer and shorter sides, which is possible. Option B has a difference of 0 between the longer and shorter sides, which is also possible.

To find the expected amount won for playing the game, we multiply this probability by the winnings when a green ball is drawn ($2) and subtract the losses when a purple ball is drawn ($-2).

The probability of rolling a 6 on both dice is 1/36, while the probability of rolling any other number is 5/36.

This means that the equation has two solutions: $x=5$ and $x=-3$. The product of these values is $5 \times (-3) = -15$, which is not one of the given options. Therefore, there are no possible values for $x$ that satisfy the equation, and the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Solving the equation, we get |x-4| = 12, which means x-4 = 12.

A,"Let's reason step by step. There are four packages and four houses, so each package has an equal chance of being delivered to any house. The probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses is the same as the probability that one package is delivered to the first house and another package is delivered to the second house. This can be expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{12}\\). However, we need to find the probability of exactly two packages being delivered to the correct houses, so we multiply this by 2! (the number of ways to choose which two packages are delivered correctly) and divide by 4! (the total number of ways to arrange all four packages). This gives us \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\times \\frac{2!}{4!} = \\frac{1}{96}\\). Therefore, the probability that exactly two of them are delivered to the correct houses is \\(\\frac{1}{96}\\).",D,"Let's reason step by step. There are 4! = 24 ways to deliver the packages. Out of these, there are several ways for two packages to be delivered correctly, such as (1,2,4,3) and (1,3,2,4). Therefore, the probability is greater than 1/4. However, we can calculate the exact probability by dividing the number of correct deliveries by the total number of possible deliveries. There are 6 ways to deliver exactly two packages correctly: (1,2,3,4), (1,2,4,3), (1,3,2,4), (1,3,4,2), (2,1,3,4), and (2,1,4,3). So the probability is 6/24 = 1/4. Therefore, the answer is A.",A

The equation $2x^2 = -2y^2 + 12x - 4y + 20$ can be simplified into $(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 = 10$, which gives a radius of $\sqrt{10}$ and a diameter of $2\sqrt{10}$.

Substituting this value back into the expression, we get $4(-1)^2 + 4(-1) + 4 = 81$. Therefore, the maximum value of the given expression over all real numbers x is $C$ or 81.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In order to maximize the value of the expression, we need to maximize each of the factors. Since $x$ can be any real number, we can make $(x+7)$ as large as we want and $(2-x)$ as small as we want. So, let's find the maximum value for both factors separately. For $(x+7)$, the maximum value is when $x=-7$, which gives us a value of $-49$. For $(2-x)$, the maximum value is when $x=2$, which gives us a value of 0. Now, we can substitute these values back into the expression to find the maximum value.

Setting these slopes equal to each other gives us e - 1 = e^x - x. Solving for x gives us x = ln(e/2) = 0.693.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The secant line on the interval [0, 1] connects the points (0, f(0)) and (1, f(1)), so its slope is $\frac{f(1) - f(0)}{1 - 0} = f(1) - f(0) = (e - 1) - 1 = e - 2$. The tangent line to the graph of $f(x)$ at any point $(x, y)$ is perpendicular to the secant line passing through that point. So, we need to find the value of c such that the slope of the tangent line at (c, f(c)) is equal to the slope of the secant line on the interval [0, 1]. The slope of the tangent line at $(c, f(c))$ is $\frac{f(c) - f(0)}{c - 0} = \frac{e^c - e + 1}{c}$. We want this to be equal to $e - 2$. So, we have the equation $\frac{e^c - e + 1}{c} = e - 2$.

The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$ is undefined when $x = 1$, so the range of the function cannot include 1. Similarly, the function cannot output 0 since the numerator is always 1. Therefore, the range of the function must be either $(-\infty,-1)\cup(1,\infty)$ or $(-\infty,0)\cup(0,\infty)$. However, we know that $f(-x) = f(x)$, so the range must be symmetric about the x-axis.

Therefore, the largest possible value of $k$ is determined by the maximum number of digits in the sequence. Since each term has at least one digit, the minimum number of terms required to have $k$ different numbers with the same number of digits is $k-1$. The maximum number of digits in a term is 9, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $\lfloor \log_{10} r^{n-1} \rfloor + 1 = 8$.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

To maximize the number of terms with the same number of digits, we need to minimize the difference between consecutive terms. This can be achieved by choosing a value for $a$ that results in the smallest possible difference between consecutive terms. The smallest possible difference occurs when $r=2$, resulting in a common difference of 1. With this value, the first few terms are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

B,"Let's reason step by step. When two positive even integers less than $15$ are added together, the sum will always be an odd number. This is because the sum of any two even numbers is always divisible by 2. Therefore, we can only have 3 possible values for the sum: 1, 3, and 5. Now let's consider the product of these two numbers. Since both numbers are positive and even, their product will also be an even number. The smallest possible value for this product is 4 (when one number is 2 and the other is 2). This means that the product can only take on 3 different values: 4, 8, and 16. When we add these products to their respective sums, we get the following combinations: 1+4=5, 3+8=11, and 5+16=21. Therefore, there are only 3 possible values for the sum when added to its product: 5, 11, and 21.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

If we measure along the diagonal of the screen, this means that the horizontal length will be shorter than if measured along the full length. To find out how much shorter it will be, we need to calculate the difference between the diagonal and the full length. The diagonal is calculated by taking the square root of (5^2 + 3^2), which gives us approximately 6.403. Subtracting this from the full length of 5, we get 5 - 6.403 = 0.597 inches.
