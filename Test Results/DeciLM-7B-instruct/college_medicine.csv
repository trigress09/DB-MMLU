Increasing the substrate concentration would increase the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, leading to an increased impact of uncompetitive inhibitors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing substrate concentration wouldn't affect the binding of either type of inhibitor, so there would be no change in their impact on enzyme activity. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean rate of oxygen consumption (VO2) is directly proportional to the rate of energy expenditure (REE). We know that 1 liter of O2 consumed produces approximately 4.8 kJ of energy. So, if a male athlete consumes 2 liters of O2 per minute during training, his REE would be approximately 9.6 kJ/min. However, since the answer choices are given in kilojoules (kJ), we need to convert this value to kJ. 1 liter of O2 consumed produces 4.8 kJ of energy, so 2 liters of O2 would produce 9.6 x 4.8 = 45.76 kJ/min. The closest answer choice is C: 80 kJ/min.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

At constant temperature, the volume of a gas will decrease as the pressure decreases. In this case, we are given that the initial volume is 0.1L at 200atm. If we reduce the pressure to 1atm, the volume will increase. However, since the temperature remains constant, the change in volume will be proportional to the change in pressure.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The car needs to reach a velocity of 130 km/h, which is equal to 130 * 1000 / 3600 = 36.1 m/s. The distance of the track is 50m. To calculate the acceleration needed, we use the formula: a = (v^2 - v_0^2) / 2d, where a is the acceleration, v is the final velocity, v_0 is the initial velocity, and d is the distance. In this case, v = 36.1 m/s, v_0 = 0 m/s (since the car starts from rest), and d = 50m. Plugging these values into the formula, we get: a = (36.1^2 - 0^2) / (2 * 50) = 7 m/s^2. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To reach an average velocity of 65 km/h over 50 meters, the car would need to accelerate at a rate of 7 m/s^2.

Using the formula: v = u + at, where v is velocity, u is initial velocity, a is acceleration, and t is time, we can solve for a. We know that u = 0 m/s since the car starts from rest, and t = 1 second. So, v = 65 km/h = 20 m/s, and u = 0 m/s. Therefore, a = (v - u) / t = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) / 1 s = 7 m/s^2.",C

C,"Let's reason step by step. Low carbohydrate intake can lead to a decrease in muscle glycogen stores, which are the primary fuel source for high-intensity exercise. This can result in impaired performance during such activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are primarily used for endurance activities, so a low-carbohydrate diet would not have a significant impact on exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes. However, it may affect the resting muscle pH and impair high intensity exercise performance. Additionally, a low-carbohydrate diet can result in greater reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's agitated behavior and aggressive claims suggest a hyperactive or overactive dopamine system. This can be due to an increase in dopamine levels, which may lead to increased activity in the brain areas associated with reward and motivation. Therefore, the most likely state of this patient's dopamine system is an elevated level of dopamine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a disruption in dopamine signaling, likely due to seizure-like activity in brain regions associated with dopamine production and regulation. This is consistent with option D. Dopamine receptors are not decreased (B), cell death is not occurring (C), and dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft may be increased or decreased (A).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a specialized organelle found in muscle cells that stores and releases calcium ions during muscle contraction. This process is essential for the proper functioning of muscles. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: store of calcium ions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in muscle contraction, and muscle contraction relies on the movement of sodium ions to generate action potentials.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In meiosis, the cell undergoes two divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II) to produce four haploid daughter cells. During mitosis, the cell also undergoes two divisions (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase). The phases common to both processes are prophase and cytokinesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both meiosis and mitosis involve periods of cell growth and DNA replication, so phases G0 and G2 must be common to both processes. However, only phase S is specific to the mitotic process. Therefore, the correct answer is B: I and II only.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency is determined by the change in frequency of a wave due to relative motion between the source, observer, or medium. To calculate this shift, we need to know the speed of sound in the medium (I), the time of interaction between the sound source and detector (II), the distance between the source and detector (III), and the frequency of emitted sound (IV). Therefore, all four variables must be known to determine the Doppler shift accurately.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler effect is about how sound changes as it travels, so we need to know the distance between the source and detector to account for sound wave spreading and attenuation. We also need to know the frequency of the emitted sound to determine the change in pitch. So, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A point mutation involves a single nucleotide change, while a deletion is the removal of one or more nucleotides from the DNA sequence. In this case, we are given an original DNA sequence and asked to determine what would be the result of experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion. The correct answer should reflect both changes. Comparing the original sequence with each of the options, we can see that option A has a single nucleotide change (G -> C) and no deletions. Option B has two nucleotide changes (T -> G and A -> C), but also includes a deletion of one nucleotide (A). Option C has three nucleotide changes (G -> T, A -> C, and C -> T), but no deletions. Finally, option D has only one nucleotide change (G -> A) and no deletions. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A deletion means a significant portion of the DNA sequence is removed, so the resulting segment should be much shorter than the original. A point mutation refers to a single base change in the DNA sequence. In this case, the most likely result of both a point mutation and a deletion would be a shorter segment with a different nucleotide at the site of the point mutation.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The electron transport chain is responsible for generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, which involves the movement of H+ ions across the mitochondrial membrane. This process requires energy to be expended in order to move the H+ ions from outside the membrane to inside. This type of energy-requiring transport is known as active transport. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The H+ ions move from an area of high concentration to low concentration across the membrane, so it must be a process of passive diffusion. This is because the movement occurs without any input of energy and is driven by the concentration gradient. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Passive Diffusion.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The function of neurons includes generating and transmitting electrical signals called action potentials. These action potentials are responsible for communication between neurons. However, the question asks us to identify what is NOT true regarding this function. Among the given options, only option C states that the transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. This statement is incorrect because it's the presynaptic neuron (not the transmitting one) that releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperpolarization makes the neuron more negative, which makes it harder to reach the threshold for an action potential, thus limiting the firing rate. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. The transmitting neuron secretes neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft from its dendrites. An action potential is initiated when the axon hillock reaches the threshold potential. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. DNA is a double-stranded molecule composed of two chains of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases (purine or pyrimidine).

D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule that provides energy for muscle contractions during exercise. After very high intensity exercise, the body needs to resynthesize phosphocreatine quickly to support further muscle contractions. The time it takes for complete resynthesis depends on various factors such as the intensity and duration of exercise, individual fitness level, and nutritional status. However, in general, the resynthesis process is relatively fast compared to other metabolic processes. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer is B: about 30 seconds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is used for quick bursts of energy, so its resynthesis should be relatively fast, likely within seconds.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Self-efficacy refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in a particular task or situation. To raise self-efficacy, it is important for individuals to engage in activities that challenge them and provide opportunities for growth. Seeking positive feedback from friends (A) can be helpful but may not always be relevant to the specific tasks Karen wants to improve on. Avoiding potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in (D) does not encourage her to face challenges and grow. Finding others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in (C) can provide her with role models and support, but it may not directly address the issue of self-efficacy. Therefore, the strategy that would NOT be a strategy that her therapist would ask her to employ to raise her sense of self-efficacy is 'A' - Seek positive feedback from friends.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

It involves a significant over-rating of the decision-making abilities of members, high loyalty and group cohesiveness causing members to feel safe raising controversial issues, and an effort to minimize conflict and ensure consensus. However, it does not necessarily lead to a decrease in creativity of individual group members in contributing to solutions the ingroup wants to achieve.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Groupthink is all about generating as many ideas as possible to find the best solution, so individual creativity is essential. High loyalty and group cohesiveness are also important for maintaining a sense of safety in raising controversial issues and proposing alternative solutions.

The experiment has four dependent variables, which are the amount the subjects were compensated (I), the room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts (II), the number of facts the subjects can recall (III), and the time the subjects were given to learn the facts (IV). However, since the subjects are randomly assigned to groups that are compensated either $10 or $20 for their participation, we can infer that the amount they were compensated is not a dependent variable. Similarly, since the subjects are asked to recall the facts in two different settings, the room in which the subjects were asked to recall facts is also not a dependent variable. Therefore, the only dependent variables in this experiment are the number of facts the subjects can recall (III) and the time the subjects were given to learn the facts (IV).",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. MERRF is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that males have two copies of the mutated gene (one from their mother and one from their father), while females only have one copy (from their mother). Since the mutation is on the X chromosome, it follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, there are three possible outcomes: 1) The offspring will inherit two copies of the mutated gene from the father (all males), 2) The offspring will inherit one copy of the mutated gene from the mother and one copy from the father (half males and half females), or 3) The offspring will inherit no copies of the mutated gene from either parent (none affected).

Similarly, innate ability and the capacity to respond to training stimulus are crucial, but they too cannot be the sole determinants of success. A high energy diet and large appetite can provide the necessary fuel for performance, but they may not be enough on their own. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is a combination of all these factors: a good coach, motivation, innate ability, and a high-energy diet.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports requires not only physical training but also mental acuity and the drive to excel. High intelligence allows for strategic thinking and quick decision-making, while motivation fuels perseverance and dedication. A good coach can provide guidance and support, but ultimately it is up to the athlete to apply themselves and respond positively to training stimuli. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The psychology study conducted on a college campus was set up to test the concept of 'choice architecture'. The researchers placed a sign 15 feet further down the hall that asked people to avoid using the stairs, forcing them to go around in a longer hallway. This is an example of how choice architecture can influence behavior. In this case, individuals who took a sweet from the tray were twice as likely to use the longer hallway as individuals who refused. The most appropriate answer is 'choice architecture' (C).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of the cookies introduces an additional choice for the participants, potentially overwhelming them with options and leading to a state of decision fatigue.
