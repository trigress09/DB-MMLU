Since the circle is inscribed inside a square, the diagonal of the square must be equal to the diameter of the circle.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given inequality is $x^2-6x+c<0$. To find the possible values of $c$, we need to find the discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

Simplifying this inequality, we get $36-4c>0$. Solving for $c$, we get $c<9$. Therefore, the possible values of $c$ are those that satisfy the inequality $c<9$. In interval notation, this can be written as $(-\infty, 9)$.",A,"Let's reason step by step. For the inequality to have real solutions, the discriminant must be equal to 6.

To cover the patio with a thickness of one brick, we need to calculate the total number of bricks required. First, let's find the area of the patio: Area = Length * Width = 12 feet * 10 feet = 120 square feet. Next, let's find the volume of one brick: Volume = Length * Width * Height = 4 inches * 6 inches * 2 inches = 48 cubic inches. To find the number of bricks required to cover the patio with a thickness of one brick, we need to calculate the total volume of bricks required and divide it by the volume of one brick: Total Volume = Area of Patio * Thickness of One Brick = 120 square feet * 4 inches = 480 cubic inches. Number of Bricks Required = Total Volume / Volume of One Brick = 480 cubic inches / 48 cubic inches = 10 bricks.

Similarly, the solutions to the second inequality can be found by solving for y: y < -x + 8.

If the advertised width of the 48-inch television is along the diagonal, then we need to find the actual horizontal length of the screen. Let's call the actual horizontal length x. We know that the diagonal length (d) can be calculated using the following formula: d = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), where y is the height of the screen. Since we know the ratio of the length to the height, we can calculate the height (y) as follows: y = (3/5) * 48 = 28.8 inches. Now, we can use this value to find the actual horizontal length (x) using the following formula: x = (d^2 - y^2) / 2. Substituting the values we have calculated, we get: x = (sqrt(1056.96 + 784.64) * 2) - 28.8^2) / 2 = 53.6 inches.

In this case, we need to find out how many positive and negative integers $12$ is a multiple of. To find the positive multiples, we divide $12$ by each positive integer starting from $1$. The quotient will be the next positive multiple. For example, $12 \div 1 = 12$, $12 \div 2 = 6$, and so on. We can continue this process until we reach a quotient of $0$. At that point, we have found all the positive multiples of $12$. To find the negative multiples, we need to find the integers that when multiplied by $-1$ give us the positive multiples. For example, if $3$ is a positive multiple of $12$, then $-3$ is a negative multiple of $12$. We can continue this process for all the positive multiples of $12$ to find all the negative multiples.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The positive integers that 12 is a multiple of are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, so there is only 1 positive integer (12 itself) that is a multiple of 12. For negative integers, since the product of two negative numbers is a positive number, any negative integer can be written as a multiple of some positive integer. Therefore, for any negative integer, there exists at least one positive integer that is a multiple of it. Since we are looking for the number of positive and negative integers that 12 is a multiple of, we have already accounted for all the positive integers in our previous analysis. For negative integers, since there exists at least one positive integer that is a multiple of any negative integer, we cannot count negative integers separately as they are always accompanied by some positive integer that is also a multiple of 12. Therefore, the number of positive and negative integers that 12 is a multiple of is equal to the number of positive integers that are multiples of 12, which is 1 (as we have already determined in our previous analysis).",A
