Next, we add the results of these two divisions: 13/14 + 7/14. To do this, we need a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators 14 and 14 is their product, which is 14 * 14 = 196. We can convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the common denominator 196: 13/14 = 13 * (1/14) = 13/14 * (14/14) = 13/14 * 1 = 13/14, and 7/14 = 7 * (1/14) = 7/14 * (14/14) = 7/14 * 1 = 7/14. Now we can add the two fractions: 13/14 + 7/14 = (13 + 7)/14 = 20/14. To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of its numerator and denominator, and divide both by that number: GCD(20, 14) = 2, so 20/14 = 20/14 * (1/2) = 10/7.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Michelle does 45 push-ups each day of the month January.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1,395 push-ups.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Michelle did 45 push-ups each day for 31 days, we need to subtract the number of days from the number of push-ups per day. This gives us 45 - 31 = 14 push-ups per day. Then we multiply that by the number of days to find the total, which is 14 x 31 = 434 push-ups. However, since the question asks for the number of push-ups she did in January and not the exact number of push-ups she did on the last day of January, we need to round up the result to the nearest whole number. This gives us a total of 435 push-ups. However, since the answer choices are given as whole numbers, it's likely that one of the answer choices is exactly equal to the total number of push-ups Michelle did in January. Let's check which answer choice matches our result. We can see that none of the answer choices match our exact result of 435 push-ups.

However, since we cannot directly add these numbers due to their different units (1.2 is in units of 1.2, while 0.4 is in units of 0.4), we need to convert them to have the same units before we can add them. Since both numbers are less than 1, we can assume that they represent fractions with a denominator of 1. Therefore, we can convert both numbers to have the same denominator of 1 by dividing each number by its denominator. This will give us the numerators of the equivalent fractions.

Since 48 square meters is a relatively large area for a box, it is reasonable to assume that the box has a significant height (perhaps several meters) in order to accommodate such a large volume. Based on this reasoning, we can estimate that the height of the box is likely to be several meters or more. Using this information, we can calculate an approximate area for the box based on its given volume and our estimated height. Specifically, if we assume that the height of the box is 10 meters (which is a reasonable guess based on our reasoning), then we can calculate the area of the base of the box as follows: A = V / h^2 = 48,000 / (10^2) = 480 square meters. Therefore, the number that makes the statement true is 480.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest number that can evenly divide both numbers. To find the GCF of 36 and 90, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. We start by finding the remainder when we divide the larger number by the smaller number. In this case, the larger number is 90 and the smaller number is 36. So, we calculate the remainder as follows: 90 % 36 = 24. Since the remainder is not zero, we repeat the process by using the larger number from the previous step as the new larger number and the smaller number from the previous step as the new smaller number. We continue this process until we get a remainder of zero. In this case, since the first remainder was 24, the next remainder will be the remainder when we divide 90 by 24 (which is 3.75, but since remainders are integers, we discard the fractional part and keep only the integer part as the next remainder). So, the next remainder is 3. Therefore, the next larger number is 3 * 24 = 72. Now, we calculate the remainder when we divide 72 by 3: the remainder is 0. Since we have a remainder of zero, we have found the greatest common factor of 36 and 90.

Now, we can perform the division: m = 6 / (10 / 40) = 6 * (40 / 10) = 6 * 4 = 24.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The number 4.95 can be written as a mixed number or fraction in simplest form.

So, 4.95 can be written as a mixed number as 4 and 95 over 100. However, this is not the simplest form. To write it as a fraction in simplest form, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator 95 and the denominator 100. The GCD of 95 and 100 is 5. So, the fraction 95 over 100 can be simplified as 19 over 20.

To do so, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 19 and 20 is 1. Therefore, the fraction 19/20 simplifies to 1 over an infinite repeating decimal 0.05. However, since we are asked for a finite fraction in simplest form, we cannot represent this answer as a finite fraction.

Therefore, we can write the equation for the approximate weight of an object on the moon in terms of its weight on Earth as: m = e/6.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the weight on the moon is 1/6 of the weight on Earth, we multiply the Earth weight (e) by 6 to find the moon weight (m). Therefore, the correct answer is D: m = 6e.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Given equation is -2k = -34.8. To find the value of k, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -2. This will give us k = 17.4. However, since the question provides options for answers, we should check if any of the given options match our answer. In this case, option B matches our answer, so the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate k, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -2: -2 * -2k = -2 * -34.8. Simplifying this expression gives us 4k = -69.6. Dividing both sides by 4, we get k = -17.2. However, since the original problem involved subtracting a constant from both sides of an equation, it's likely that the constants in the answer choices are meant to be added to the solution instead of being subtracted. In this case, the correct answer would be the one with the constant that needs to be added to the solution, which is D: 69.6.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the remainder when dividing 21 by 7, we can use the division algorithm. First, we divide the dividend (21) by the divisor (7). The quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The remainder is the number that is left over after dividing, so in this case, the remainder of 21 divided by 7 is 21. However, we are looking for the remainder and not the quotient or the dividend. Therefore, the answer is not A (21), but instead C (1). To find the remainder, we can use the formula: Remainder = Dividend % Divisor. Applying this formula to our problem, we get: Remainder = 21 % 7. The result of this calculation is indeed 1, which is the correct answer.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the value of y in the equation 8y = 56, we need to isolate y on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 8. So, 8y/8 = 56/8. Simplifying this expression gives us y = 7.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a number that, when added to 8, gives us 56. Since 8 + 48 equals 56, the value of y must be 48. However, since we are looking for the letter corresponding to the answer, and not the actual value of y, the correct answer is C, since 8C = 56.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Wendy wants to determine which flavor of ice cream is the most popular at her school. To do this, she needs to choose a random sample of students from her school. The best way for her to choose a random sample would be to use simple random sampling. This method involves selecting individuals or objects randomly and without replacement from the population. In other words, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. None of the given options (A, B, C, D) describe this method exactly, but option A comes closest as it does not specify any particular method for selecting students.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure the survey reflects the preferences of the entire school, it's best to choose participants who already like Wendy's favorite flavor, as they are more likely to participate and provide accurate feedback. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer.",D

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The mean of a set of data is the sum of all the numbers in the set divided by the total number of numbers in the set. In this case, the set contains 12 numbers: 18, 9, 9, 10, 11, 14, 30, 19. Let's calculate the sum and divide it by 12 to find the mean. The sum of all the numbers in the set is 257. Dividing this sum by 12 (the total number of numbers in the set), we get a mean of approximately 21.42."",

B,"Let's reason step by step. To estimate the sum of 27.94 + 15.35 to the nearest tenth, we need to round each number to the nearest tenth and then add them up. Rounding 27.94 to the nearest tenth gives us 28. Rounding 15.35 to the nearest tenth gives us 15. Therefore, the estimated sum is 28 + 15 = 43. However, since we are asked for an answer in one of the given choices, we need to select the closest choice among A, B, C and D. Comparing our estimated sum of 43 with the given choices, the closest choice is B: 43.3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 27.94 down gives us 27, and rounding 15.35 down gives us 15. Adding these rounded numbers, we get 27 + 15 = 42. To estimate the sum to the nearest tenth, we can simply round up 42 to 43. Therefore, the estimated sum of 27.94 + 15.35 to the nearest tenth is 43.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the prime factorization of a number, we need to break down the number into its prime factors. We can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by its smallest prime factor until we reach a prime number that cannot be factored further. In the case of 48, we can start by dividing it by 2 since 2 is the smallest prime number. This leaves us with 24. We can now repeat the process with 24. Since 2 is already a factor, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3. Dividing 24 by 3 leaves us with 8. Since 2 is already a factor, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 2 again. Dividing 8 by 2 leaves us with 4. Since 2 is already a factor, we cannot divide any further. Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is 2^3 \u2022 3^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can break down 48 into 4 multiplied by 8, as 4 times 8 equals 48. These two numbers are factors of 48.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To write 60 over 72 in simplest form, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, and then divide both the numerator and denominator by their GCD. In this case, the GCD of 60 and 72 is 24. Therefore, we can write 60 over 72 in simplest form as: 60/72 = (60/24) / (72/24) = 15/18. However, since 15 and 18 have no common factors other than 1, we cannot simplify this fraction any further. Therefore, the answer is: D. 5 over 6 is not the simplest form of 60 over 72.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both 60 and 72 are divisible by 6. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 6, we get 10 over 12 as the simplified fraction. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
