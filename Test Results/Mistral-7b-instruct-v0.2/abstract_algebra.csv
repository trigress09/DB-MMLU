Statement 2: Q is an ideal in R. This statement is true because an ideal is a subset of a ring that satisfies two properties: closure under addition and closure under multiplication by elements in the subset or the ring. In this case, since Q is a subset of the ring R, it suffices to show that Q is closed under addition and multiplication by elements in Q or R. Let x, y be any two elements in Q. Then, x + y is also an element in Q because Q is a subgroup of R (since it is an ideal), and subgroups are closed under addition.
