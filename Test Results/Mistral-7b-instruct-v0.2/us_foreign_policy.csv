D,"Let's reason step by step. Exceptionalism is a theory that holds that the United States is unique in its history, culture, and political institutions. This theory has been used to justify both isolationist and internationalist strategies. Isolationists argue that the US should focus on its own interests and not get involved in foreign conflicts. They believe that exceptionalism means that the US is strong enough to go it alone. Internationalists, on the other hand, argue that the US should use its exceptional position to lead the world and promote peace, stability, and prosperity. They believe that exceptionalism means that the US has a unique responsibility to use its power for good in the world. In this sense, exceptionalism can link isolationist and internationalist strategies by providing a theoretical justification for both approaches.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which ideology considers it immoral to use force abroad to do good things, such as human rights protection and democracy. Idealism is an ideology that emphasizes moral values and ethical principles in political decision-making. Idealists believe that the world can be made a better place through the application of moral principles and the pursuit of justice. Therefore, it is consistent with the tenets of idealism to consider it immoral to use force abroad to do good things without proper regard for the moral principles involved. In contrast, realism emphasizes the importance of power and national interests in international relations, while liberalism emphasizes individual rights and freedoms as the foundation of political legitimacy. None of these ideologies necessarily considers it immoral to use force abroad to do good things.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Idealism emphasizes cooperation and ethical considerations in international relations, advocating for peaceful resolutions and opposing the use of force. Realism, on the other hand, focuses on power and national interests in international relations, often justifying the use of force to protect or advance those interests.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Before 1865, US expansion was primarily focused on acquiring new territories through various means such as purchase, annexation, or conquest. After the Civil War ended in 1865, the focus of US expansion shifted from territory to markets. This was due to several factors including the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, which facilitated faster and more efficient transportation of goods between the East and West coasts; the growth of US industries such as steel, textiles, and machinery, which required access to larger markets both domestically and internationally; and the increasing globalization of economies and trade, which created new opportunities for US businesses to expand their markets abroad.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States focused on rebuilding and internal development after the Civil War, leading to a halt in territorial expansion efforts.

Therefore, while international trade can bring numerous benefits, it is not always in the best interests of all parties involved.",B,"Let's reason step by step. International conflict and security concerns often disrupt trade routes and create instability, leading countries to prioritize self-sufficiency and protectionism. However, there are other reasons why countries may seek to protect their domestic industries from foreign competition. One such reason is the unequal distribution of costs and benefits of free trade. While the benefits of free trade are often dispersed among a large population, the costs of free trade are often concentrated on specific industries or groups. This can create political pressure for governments to implement protectionist policies in order to shield domestic industries from foreign competition.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. International Institutionalists argue that international institutions have been designed to address specific problems in the international system.

In particular, local developments in the Third World were often viewed through a geopolitical lens, with an emphasis on their potential strategic significance for the United States and its allies. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given its own experience with colonialism and its opposition to Soviet expansion, the US must have wholeheartedly supported decolonization movements in the Third World. However, this is not what the question asks. Instead, it asks how the Cold War context shaped US perceptions of the Third World. To answer this question, we need to understand that during the Cold War, local developments in the Third World were viewed through a geopolitical lens. This means that the US and other major powers saw the Third World as a battleground for their ideological and strategic interests. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Realists in international relations theory emphasize the role of power, security, and national interests in shaping foreign policy.

In this context, international institutions allow the US to act in concert with other countries, enhancing its ability to shape the international agenda and advance its strategic objectives.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Liberal Internationalists likely view international institutions as constraints on US power and autonomy, making them incompatible with a grand strategy that prioritizes American interests and unilateral action. However, they argue that these institutions also provide important benefits to the US. Specifically, they serve as platforms for diplomacy and cooperation, help to promote stability and reduce conflict, and can facilitate the pursuit of shared economic interests. In short, Liberal Internationalists argue that international institutions are important to US grand strategy because they serve American interests by providing a forum for diplomacy and cooperation, promoting stability and reducing conflict, and facilitating the pursuit of shared economic interests.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Cold War was a state of geopolitical tension between the Western Bloc (led by the United States) and the Eastern Bloc (led by the Soviet Union). American exceptionalism refers to the belief that the United States is unique among nations, with a special mission or destiny. During the Cold War, American exceptionalism was influenced in several ways. The extension of American power globally challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism. At the same time, America's status as the 'leader of the free world' enhanced exceptionalist beliefs. Therefore, answer D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Cold War solidified America's position as the leader of the free world, reinforcing the notion of American exceptionalism and its unique role in promoting democracy and freedom globally. However, this extension of American power globally also challenged core assumptions of exceptionalism, particularly regarding the idea that America was inherently different from other nations and could not be understood through the same lens as other countries.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. 'Democratic enlargement' was a term used during the Cold War to describe the expansion of democratic rule in Europe, particularly in Eastern Europe. This process was seen as a counterbalance to the spread of communism. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. 'Democratic enlargement' likely refers to proposals for expanding and improving democratic processes within the US government, such as increasing voter participation and representation. However, it could also refer to a broader international context, where the term might be used to describe efforts to extend democratic rule globally. Based on the context of the question, it seems more likely that the term is being used in the international context. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nonstate actors that pose a threat to the United States include terrorists, organized crime groups, and drug traffickers. Among these, China is not a nonstate actor that poses a threat to the United States.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Organized crime often operates across borders and can have significant influence over governments, posing a threat similar to that of nation-states. Terrorists, drug traffickers, and organized crime are all nonstate actors that pose a threat to the United States. However, China is not a nonstate actor but rather a sovereign state.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Vietnam War was a long, costly armed conflict that pitted the communist regime of North Vietnam and its southern allies, known as the National Liberation Front (NLF) or the Viet Cong, against the United States and South Vietnam. The war is typically divided into three distinct phases: the French colonial period from 1945 to 1954; the American involvement from 1955 to 1973; and the post-American phase from 1973 to 1975. Each phase of the war had its unique characteristics, causes, and consequences. In this context, all of the above statements are true in different ways.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Vietnam War, with its unclear objectives and protracted conflict, demonstrates the limitations of even a superpower like the US in achieving victory against a determined adversary. This can be seen as an example of how great powers may not always prevail against determined enemies unless there is a clear objective and the national will to do so. Therefore, answer C is the most appropriate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Realists argue that the onset of the Cold War was primarily driven by power politics and the balance of power between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. The expansionist nature of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, as well as the perceived threat posed by the Soviet Union to Western Europe and the United States, fueled the arms race and the political tensions that characterized the Cold War. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The end of World War II created a power vacuum in Europe, which the Soviet Union sought to fill. This power imbalance led to the Cold War. However, ideological differences between the United States and the Soviet Union also played a significant role in fueling the conflict. Therefore, both power imbalances and ideological differences accounted for the onset of the Cold War.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The United Nations (A) is indeed a well-known and important international organization, but it is not the only one nor necessarily the most important one depending on the context. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (B), the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (C), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (D) are all significant international organizations with distinct roles and missions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. OPEC's control over oil production and pricing gives it significant leverage over the global economy, making it a crucial international organization. However, when considering the best known and most important international organizations, the United Nations stands out as the preeminent global intergovernmental organization founded in 1945 after the end of World War II. The UN's mission is to maintain international peace and security, protect human rights, deliver humanitarian aid, promote sustainable development, and uphold international law. Given this context, while OPEC is a significant international organization, it does not hold a candle to the United Nations in terms of importance and influence.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In predicting which states will get nuclear weapons, several factors can be considered. However, some factors are better predictors than others. In this question, we are asked to identify the factor that is NOT a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons. Based on available evidence and research, the following factors have been identified as good predictors: receipt of sensitive nuclear assistance, wealth/GDP, and rivalry with a nuclear state. The following factor has been identified as NOT a good predictor: regime type.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If a state receives sensitive nuclear assistance, it indicates a clear intention and capability to develop nuclear weapons. Therefore, this is a good predictor of which states will get nuclear weapons. On the other hand, regime type is not a reliable predictor of nuclear weapon acquisition. While some authoritarian regimes have acquired nuclear weapons, democratic countries have also developed nuclear arsenals.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'open-door notes' were a series of diplomatic notes exchanged between the United States and China in the late 1800s. These notes aimed to establish more favorable trade relations between the two countries. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'open-door notes' aimed to protect China's economy from foreign exploitation by advocating for economic self-sufficiency and limiting foreign trade. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The US being exceptional is a subjective concept that has been debated extensively. Some argue that the US is exceptional due to its liberal character and sense of special mission. Others argue that the US is exceptional due to its exclusive concentration on issues of power and security. In this case, answer B seems to be the most appropriate answer as it aligns with the idea of the US having a unique liberal character and sense of special mission.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The US prioritizes its own power and security interests above all else, which distinguishes it from other nations and contributes to its exceptionalism. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Some scholars claim that Reagan 'won the Cold War' due to his military spending during his first term. This increased pressure on the Soviet Union to keep up its international commitments, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union.",A,"Let's reason step by step. By reducing military spending, Reagan eased the economic burden on the Soviet Union, allowing them to focus on internal reforms and ultimately leading to their collapse. However, this is not the answer given in the choices. The answer provided in the question is A: Reagan's first term military spending pressured the Soviet Union to keep up its international commitments. This answer is partially correct but it does not fully capture the reasoning behind why some scholars claim that Reagan 'won the Cold War'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump attacked globalization by arguing that it harmed 'ordinary Americans.' He claimed that liberal elites had encouraged globalization, while American workers lost jobs as a result. This narrative is reflected in option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Donald Trump criticized globalization for promoting trade wars that harmed the American economy and led to job losses. In his 2016 campaign, he accused liberal elites of encouraging globalization while ordinary Americans suffered from its negative effects. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Wilson proposed the League of Nations after World War I, with the goal of preventing future wars through collective security and diplomacy. However, Congress opposed this proposal for several reasons. One of these reasons was the fear that the League would encourage Soviet influence in the US (answer A). Another reason was the fear that the League would be anti-democratic (answer B), as some members believed that the League's decisions should not be based on a simple majority vote. However, it is important to note that these reasons were not mutually exclusive, and some members of Congress may have held multiple concerns at once.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Congress opposed the League of Nations because they feared it would undermine American democracy and impose foreign values on the United States. Additionally, some members of Congress believed that the League could lead to an international alliance that might commit the US to military conflicts without proper consultation or authorization from Congress. Therefore, based on these concerns, Congress opposed Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations.",B

With this understanding, the most appropriate answer is C: the increasing importance of economic instruments of foreign policy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The US dependence on oil necessitates a strong military presence in oil-rich regions to ensure access and control over these vital resources. This strategic priority has significantly influenced U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: the importance of military superiority.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socio-economic accounts of US Cold War foreign policy focus on the role of class and economic interests in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War period. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socio-Economic accounts of US foreign policy consider a wide range of factors, including ideology, language, culture, and economic interests, to provide a comprehensive understanding of its motivations. Among these factors, the focus on class and economic interests distinguishes Socio-Economic accounts from other approaches to US Cold War foreign policy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'New World Order' is a controversial and ambiguous term that has been used in various contexts, particularly in relation to international relations and globalization. The most common interpretation is that it refers to a new era of global cooperation and interdependence, characterized by the dominance of Western powers, particularly the United States, and the spread of capitalist economic systems around the world. However, there are also other interpretations of the term 'New World Order', which may refer to different things depending on the context in which they are used.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The 'New World Order' referred to a new economic system established after the Cold War, characterized by free trade, globalization, and increased economic cooperation among nations. Based on this definition, the most appropriate answer is C: A new global economic framework.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) initially favored an 'isolationist' stance on the part of the US during the 1930s due to his belief that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US. This is the answer.,A,Let's reason step by step. Roosevelt initially favored isolationism because he believed that a German-dominated Europe would create stability and economic opportunities for the United States. He also thought that internal reform rather than international negotiation was the key to economic regeneration of the US.,A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'father of containment' refers to the individual who first articulated the policy of containing the spread of communism after World War II. Among the given options, George Kennan is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As president during the early years of the Cold War, Dwight Eisenhower played a crucial role in implementing the policy of containment, making him its 'father'. However, it was George Kennan who first articulated the principles of containment in a 1947 article for Foreign Affairs magazine. Therefore, while both Eisenhower and Kennan are significant figures in the history of containment, the title of 'father' is more appropriately attributed to Dwight Eisenhower.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'Rogue States' was used to describe countries that were perceived as posing a threat to international peace and security due to their actions or policies. This term gained prominence during the Cold War when certain countries aligned with neither the Western Bloc nor the Eastern Bloc were labeled as rogue states. However, the term is not limited to the Cold War era and can be applied to any country that poses a significant threat to international peace and security. In this context, the most appropriate answer is (B) States outside of the 'family of nations'"", as this term can encompass countries that are perceived as rogue states due to their actions or policies.",B,"Let's reason step by step.
