The computation C lasts for at least n steps, and M prints a 1 at some point after the nth step. This problem is also undecidable because it is equivalent to the halting problem with an additional condition that the machine must print a 1 after halting. However, this additional condition does not affect the decidability of the problem as it is still equivalent to the halting problem.\nIII. M scans at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C. This problem is decidable because it can be solved by simulating the Turing machine step by step and keeping track of the number of distinct tape squares that have been scanned so far.

The value of this bit indicates the sign of the number: 0 for positive and 1 for negative.

In a pipelined RISC computer, the execution time of a typical program depends on various factors such as clock cycle rate, instruction cache size, data cache size, and forwarding in the pipeline.

Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time (III) improves the performance by reducing the number of cache misses.

The number of edges E in a connected, undirected graph G = (V, E) with V vertices must satisfy the inequality |E| >= |V| - 1 because every edge connects exactly two vertices, and since G is connected, there must be at least one edge connecting any pair of vertices.

B,Let's reason step by step. The given problem describes a language L that can be recognized by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The DFA has to have a minimum number of states to recognize the language L. The problem provides four options for the minimum number of states in the DFA. Let's analyze each option and determine which one is correct.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Since we have two possible input symbols, 0 and 1, and the DFA needs to track the count of both, the total number of states should be proportional to the square of the number of symbols. However, since the problem statement specifies that the given set L can be recognized by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), we know that the DFA recognizing L will have no ε-transitions and no accepting states other than the final state. This means that the DFA recognizing L must be a complete and trimmed DFA, which implies that it cannot have any unnecessary or redundant states. Therefore, the minimum number of states in the DFA recognizing L should only be enough to cover all possible combinations of input symbols that satisfy the given conditions for membership in set L. Based on this reasoning, we can calculate the minimum number of states as follows: Let n be the smallest integer such that (kn + 1) is a power of 2. Then, the minimum number of states in the DFA recognizing L is 2^(n+1)).",B

Since there are 256 iterations in the loop, the total number of bytes written to memory during the execution of the loop is 2048 bytes (256 * 8).

Type compatibility rules determine how different data types can be used together in expressions and assignments, which aligns with the capabilities of context-free grammars. Context-free grammars are a formal way to define the structure of a language, particularly its syntax.
