To find the force in newtons, we need to use Coulomb's law which states that the force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. However, since we are given only one charge and its strength, we cannot directly apply Coulomb's law. Instead, we can use the definition of electric charge and its relationship with force.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given alternators are working in parallel, and each alternator is rated for 20 MVA. The total MVA capacity of the parallel system would be the sum of the individual ratings: 20 MVA + 20 MVA = 40 MVA. However, the question asks for the short circuit level at the busbar, which is not directly related to the rated capacities of the alternators. Instead, the short circuit level at the busbar depends on the total short circuit current that can be supplied by all the alternators connected in parallel. The short circuit current of each alternator can be calculated using its subtransient reactance (X'd) and its rated voltage (V): Isc = V / X'd. In this case, each alternator has a subtransient reactance of 16% and is rated for an 11 KV voltage. Therefore, the short circuit current of each alternator would be: Isc = 11000 / (0.16 * 11000)) = 235.71 A. The total short circuit current that can be supplied by all the alternators connected in parallel would be the sum of the individual short circuit currents: 235.71 A + 235.71 A = 471.42 A.

One such advantage is an increase in the power transfer capability of the transmission line. This is because higher voltage allows for more current to be transmitted through the line, resulting in increased power delivery. Another advantage of higher transmission voltage is a reduction in transmission line losses. This is due to the fact that higher voltage results in lower current flowing through the line, which in turn reduces the amount of resistance encountered by the current, and thus decreases the amount of energy lost as heat during transmission. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D, all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With higher voltage, the current flowing through the transmission line decreases for the same power transfer, which directly leads to lower losses due to reduced I^2R heating.

In an SR latch built from NOR gates, the S and R inputs are connected to the output through inverters. The S input sets the output to 1 when S=1 and R=0. The R input resets the output to 0 when R=1 and S=0. However, there is a condition that is not allowed: when both S and R are equal to 1 (S=1, R=1). In this case, both the set and reset inputs are trying to change the state of the flip-flop at the same time, which results in an undefined or unpredictable behavior.

The potentiometer consists of a resistive element with a variable resistance that can be adjusted by rotating a shaft connected to the resistance element. When a known reference voltage is applied across the ends of the resistive element, the unknown voltage to be measured can be determined by measuring the position of the wiper arm on the resistive element that corresponds to the unknown voltage. The advantage of using a potentiometer for DC voltage measurement is that it provides a convenient and accurate method for measuring DC voltages without loading the circuit excessively. In contrast, when using a direct measurement method using a voltmeter, the voltmeter introduces an additional resistance into the circuit, which can significantly load the circuit and affect the accuracy of the measurement.

The dashpot in a mechanical system provides damping, similar to how a capacitor stores and releases energy in an electrical circuit, so the analogous quantity is capacitance.

Mathematically, R = \u03a9 * (l / A). Now, let's apply this formula to the given problem. The diameter of the conductor is halved, which means that its cross-sectional area is reduced by a factor of 4 (since the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its diameter). Therefore, the resistance of the conductor will be increased by a factor of 16 (since resistance is directly proportional to resistivity and inversely proportional to cross-sectional area and length). Now, let's calculate the new resistance using the given formula. The resistivity of the conductor is not provided in the question, so we cannot directly calculate the new resistance. However, based on the information provided in the question, we can deduce that the new resistance will be greater than the original resistance (since the resistance is directly proportional to the resistivity and inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area and length). Therefore, based on the given information, the correct answer is D: 8R \u03a9.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. If the diameter is halved, the area is divided by 2, and if the length is doubled, the resistance is multiplied by 2. So the new resistance will be R*2/2=R. Since the original resistance was R, we need to find a multiple of R that fits one of the given choices. We can see that none of the given choices are equal to R. The smallest multiple of R that fits one of the given choices is 4R, which corresponds to choice C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The force between two parallel conductors carrying a current I, separated by a distance d, is given by the formula F = (2 * I^2) / (pi * d). Substituting the given values, we get F = (2 * 100^2) / (pi * 0.02). Solving this equation, we find that F = 3546.7 N. Dividing this force by the length of each conductor, we get the force per meter of length of each conductor. Therefore, the answer is A: 100 N.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The force per meter of length between two parallel conductors carrying current is given by F/L=μ_0*I_1*I_2/(2πd). Plugging in the values, we get F/L=2*10^{-7}*100*100/(20*10^{-3})=1 N/m. Therefore, the force per meter of length on each conductor is 1 N/m.",C
