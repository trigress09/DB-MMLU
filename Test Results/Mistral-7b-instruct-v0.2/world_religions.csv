Many spiritual traditions recommend daily meditation or reflection for around 36 minutes, so Jaina devotees likely follow a similar practice. However, none of the given options exactly match this duration. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors that might influence the answer. For instance, some sources suggest that Jaina monks and nuns may meditate for longer durations, such as 4 hours or even more. On the other hand, lay Jaina followers might have less time available for daily meditation due to work, family, or other commitments. Based on this reasoning, it is possible that some Jaina devotees might practise meditation for around 48 minutes per day, especially if they are monks or nuns with fewer distractions and more time available for spiritual practices. However, without further research or specific information about the Jaina community in question, it is impossible to know for certain whether 48 minutes is indeed the average duration of daily meditation practised by all Jaina devotees.

There are several main forms of Buddhism, each with its own distinct characteristics and practices. In Sri Lanka, Theravada Buddhism is the most widely practiced form. This is because Theravada Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE, and it has remained the dominant religious tradition in the country ever since.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Zen Buddhism, with its emphasis on meditation and achieving enlightenment through direct experience, is likely the dominant form in Sri Lanka. However, Theravada Buddhism, which is also known for its emphasis on scripture and monastic discipline, is the most widely practiced form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of Mecca to Islam is a significant event in Islamic history. Several battles took place before this conversion, and each battle had its significance. However, the battle that directly led to the conversion of Mecca was the Battle of Badr. In this battle, the Muslim army, led by Muhammad (PBUH), defeated the Meccan army. This victory boosted the morale of the Muslims and encouraged more people to join Islam. Eventually, the majority of the population in Mecca converted to Islam, leading to the establishment of the Islamic state in Mecca.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Battle of Uhud was a significant victory for the early Muslims, demonstrating their strength and likely leading to the conversion of Mecca. However, this battle did not directly lead to the conversion of Mecca as it occurred before that event.

Therefore, it's plausible that the Celestial Masters, being anti-Han, adhered to Confucian principles in their rebellion against the ruling dynasty. However, upon further investigation, it turns out that the Celestial Masters were actually a Daoist sect. This misconception arises from the fact that the Celestial Masters' teachings contained elements of both Daoism and Confucianism. Nevertheless, their primary religious affiliation was with Daoism. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Daoism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Guru Nanak and his successors, known as the Sikh Gurus, instructed the use of particular Sikh Ragas during religious ceremonies and daily life.

However, the question asks for a Roman statesman who encouraged civic religion in his work ""The Laws."" Although Plato is an influential philosopher, he was not a Roman statesman.  Among the given options, Varro is the most appropriate answer as he was a prominent Roman scholar and writer who explored various aspects of Roman culture, including religion. In his works, Varro discussed the role of civic religion in Roman society. Therefore, Varro's work ""The Laws"" would be an excellent example of a Roman statesman encouraging civic religion in his work.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Confucian philosophy emphasizes personal and moral self-improvement, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity. Among the Confucian philosophers, Dao is known as a mystic due to his focus on qi (or ch'i), which is an intangible energy force that flows through all things in the universe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Daoism places significant emphasis on the concept of qi as a vital life force.  Therefore, it's likely that a Confucian philosopher described as a mystic due to their focus on qi would be associated with Daoist principles.

Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings in Mahayana Buddhism who have vowed to help all sentient beings achieve enlightenment.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The Hindu god or goddess who is speech incarnate, the power of the word, and the mother of the Vedas is Sarasvati.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Indra, as the king of the gods, holds significant power and authority.  Therefore, it's plausible that Indra would be considered speech incarnate and the mother of the Vedas, given the power associated with words and knowledge.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The term Vajrayana or Vajrya means 'diamond' in Sanskrit. It is a major branch of Buddhism that developed in India and Tibet. In this context, the most appropriate answer is Thunderbolt or Vajra, which is a symbol of indestructibility and divine power in Vajrayana Buddhism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Diamonds are known for their brilliance and value.  Therefore, it's likely that ""vajrya"" also refers to another precious gemstone, such as an emerald, which shares similar qualities. However, the term ""vajrya"" is actually a term in Buddhism, where it refers to a state of enlightenment or a spiritual master. In this context, ""thunderbolt"" or ""lightning"" could be metaphors for the sudden and powerful realization that comes with enlightenment.
