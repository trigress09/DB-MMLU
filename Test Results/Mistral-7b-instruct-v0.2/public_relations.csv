This can be influenced by various factors such as attitude towards the behavior, subjective norms, perceived control, and self-efficacy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Coorientation is a crucial step in the process of behavior change, as it involves aligning the individual's understanding with the desired outcome.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Libel is a form of defamation that is published in written or printed form, including social media. Public figures, such as politicians, have less protection against defamation than private individuals because they are expected to have a thicker skin and to be able to counteract any false statements made about them. In contrast, entities such as houses of worship, government institutions, and publicly-traded companies cannot sue for libel because they do not possess the necessary human qualities to bring a defamation claim.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Houses of worship, as entities with reputations to uphold, should have the right to sue for libel if their image is tarnished by false statements. Politicians, government institutions, publicly-traded companies, and other entities also have reputations to protect and may therefore have the right to sue for libel. However, houses of worship are typically granted special protections under the law due to their unique role in society. As a result, they are generally not considered to be able to sue for libel.",B
