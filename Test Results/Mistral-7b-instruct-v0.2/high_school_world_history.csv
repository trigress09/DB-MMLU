B,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's ruling style, as described in the passage, is characterized by his determination to change Russia and his conviction that he must provide both the direction and the motive force for this transformation. He was not only determined to lead but also willing to use force when education and persuasion were not enough. Based on this description, it is clear that Peter the Great's ruling style was that of an absolutist.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, the text also describes Peter as convinced that he alone could provide both the direction and the motive force for transforming Russia. This suggests an absolutist ruling style, where power is concentrated in the hands of one person. Based on this analysis, the answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Kwame Nkrumah's speech, he criticizes the French for their disregard of African independence. He mentions two specific instances where the French ignored African opposition: the French atomic tests in the Sahara and the U.N. in the Congo quibbling about constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy. Based on these examples, it is clear that the French saw Africa as a collection of republics tottering into anarchy (Option A).",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Among the given options, the invention of steam-powered ships (Option D) is the least likely answer. This is because steam-powered ships played a crucial role in Europe's expansion and colonization of Africa. They enabled European powers to transport large numbers of troops, supplies, and equipment across long distances quickly and efficiently. Additionally, steam-powered ships allowed European powers to establish regular trade routes with Africa, which provided them with valuable resources such as gold, diamonds, ivory, and slaves. In summary, the invention of steam-powered ships was a crucial technological innovation that played a significant role in Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Ibn Battuta's travels in the 14th century, but it also provides valuable information about the period between 600 C.E. and 1450 C.E. One of the most significant developments during this period was the emergence of new trade links across Eurasia. This process was facilitated by the unification of various steppe nomad empires, which controlled vast territories and populations. These empires not only provided military protection for traders but also established a network of caravan routes that connected different parts of Eurasia. As a result, goods and ideas could travel freely across vast distances, leading to increased cultural exchange and the spread of technological innovations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. However, the passage also mentions that these religious groups are 'exceedingly numerous', and that their streets are 'well disposed'. This suggests that there was a significant population of each religious group, and that they were able to coexist peacefully in the same city. Therefore, while the passage does suggest that there may have been some degree of religious isolationism during this period, it also indicates that there were significant populations of various religious groups living in close proximity to one another, and that they were able to coexist peacefully. Based on this reasoning, option C is the most directly supported conclusion about the period 600 C.E.\u20131450 C.E.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem 'Ballad of the Army Carts' provides evidence about gender relations in Tang society.

It also mentions the great dignity that came to the Mazdayanian religion and the magi in the empire as a result of this preeminence. Furthermore, it is mentioned that Ahriman [the evil counterpart to Ahura Mazda] and the demons were punished and rebuked during this period, and their teachings departed from the empire. Based on this information, we can infer that rulers in the period circa 600 B.C.E.\u2013600 C.E. derived legitimacy for their rule through the sponsorship of religion and chief priests.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Ibn Battuta's journey to Aden, a port city on the coast of the Indian Ocean. The text mentions that Aden is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only. It also states that Aden has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. Furthermore, the passage describes how the Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the development in the Indian Ocean trade network best reflected by Ibn Battuta's account is the ability of commerce to foster cultural diffusion (Option A). This is evident from the text as it describes how merchants from various parts of the world, including Arabian port cities, Indian ports, and Egyptian ports, were living in Aden. The passage also mentions that there were Indian merchants living in Aden, as well as Egyptian merchants. These merchants brought with them not only their goods but also their cultures, which contributed to the rich cultural tapestry of Aden and the wider Indian Ocean world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The journal entry mentions the immense wealth of some merchants, suggesting a thriving trade based on the overproduction and export of cash crops from the region. However, the text also mentions that some merchants are sole owners of large ships with all their contents, indicating a significant investment in maritime transportation infrastructure. This suggests that while there may be an element of overproduction and export of cash crops contributing to the wealth of some merchants, the trade network is likely to involve more complex dynamics, including significant investments in maritime transportation infrastructure.",B

However, if a zamindar wished to establish a claim to sovereignty, the first step was to refuse or omit to pay revenue. Such an omission might arise from various other causes, but it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion. Based on this information, the most appropriate answer is B: universal taxation.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

The letter is a plea from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, expressing his concern over the kidnapping of his people and selling them into slavery. This situation was causing great distress to the king and his people. The tone of the letter reflects the growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods (A), but it also highlights the vigorous resistance to European expeditions of conquest (B). However, in this case, the resistance was not effective enough to prevent the kidnapping and selling into slavery of the Kongo people. Therefore, the most accurate answer is C, as the establishment of Portuguese trading posts along the coastline contributed to the growing dependence on trade with Europe for manufactured goods, but it also facilitated the kidnapping and selling into slavery of the Kongo people.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

The passage describes the decline of the Roman Empire, mentioning various factors such as civil wars, barbarian incursions, the persistence of the senate, and demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics. To determine which factor contributed LEAST to the decline of the Roman Empire, we need to consider the impact each factor had on the empire. Let's examine each option: \n\nA) Civil wars between rivals for the throne: Civil wars were a major cause of instability in the Roman Empire. They often resulted in the destruction of cities, the loss of territory, and the weakening of the imperial government. However, it is important to note that civil wars were not the only factor contributing to the decline of the Roman Empire. Other factors such as barbarian incursions, the persistence of the senate, and demographic weakness on account of diseases and epidemics also played a role. \n\nB) Incursions of barbarian peoples into the empire: Barbarian incursions were another major cause of instability in the Roman Empire.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is from the Upanishads, an ancient Indian text that deals with spiritual and philosophical concepts. The excerpt describes a person who has gained self-knowledge and understanding of his true nature. He realizes that he is not born again after reaching this state. The Buddhist doctrine regarding reincarnation most resembles Hinduism in that both belief systems retain the concept of karma.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach about reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of this cycle of rebirth is to reach a state of enlightenment and ascend to a heavenly realm. However, the key difference between the two lies in their beliefs regarding karma and the attainment of enlightenment. In Hinduism, karma plays a central role in the belief system, as it is considered to be the driving force behind the cycle of rebirth. On the other hand, Buddhism also teaches about karma, but it places more emphasis on the concept of suffering and the Four Noble Truths, which are considered to be the foundation of Buddhist teachings. In terms of the attainment of enlightenment, both Hinduism and Buddhism teach that this can only be achieved through a long and arduous spiritual journey, during which one must cultivate various virtues, such as compassion, wisdom, and detachment, and engage in various spiritual practices, such as meditation, prayer, and self-reflection. However, while Hinduism teaches that the ultimate goal of this spiritual journey is to attain a state of union with the divine, known as moksha or mukti, and thus escape the cycle of rebirth, Buddhism teaches that the ultimate goal of this spiritual journey is to achieve a state of enlightenment, known as bodhi, and thus end the suffering caused by the cycle of rebirth.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Otto von Bismarck expressed concern about the security of workers' existence, particularly their lack of job security and the absence of adequate support from society during periods of poverty or illness. In response to this evaluation, twentieth-century economist John Maynard Keynes might suggest that society address these concerns by implementing policies aimed at maintaining aggregate demand in the economy. This could include measures such as increasing government spending on public works projects, implementing tax policies designed to stimulate consumer spending, and providing subsidies or other forms of assistance to industries or sectors of the economy that are experiencing particular difficulties.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Keynes generally cautioned against excessive government intervention in the economy, believing that market forces should play a primary role in regulating economic activity. However, he also recognized that there were certain circumstances where government intervention could be justified in order to maintain aggregate demand and prevent economic downturns. In this context, it is likely that Keynes would recommend some form of government intervention in order to address the economic insecurity faced by workers in Germany as described by Otto von Bismarck.",A

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The question asks which reason explains why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867. The options provided are A, B, C, and D. Let's examine each option: \nA) The British crown offered incentives to those who would establish homesteads in the unsettled lands of South Africa. This reason is plausible as the British crown did offer incentives for settlers to move to South Africa. However, it is important to note that this reason alone does not fully explain why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867.\nB) The Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean. This reason is less plausible as there is no evidence provided in the text that suggests the Zulu created attractive trade ports along the Indian Ocean as a reason for European citizens moving in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867.\nC) The Berlin Conference clarified boundaries, thus making it logistically sound for Europeans to move to the African colonies. This reason is plausible as the Berlin Conference did play a significant role in the colonization of Africa by European powers. However, it is important to note that this reason alone does not fully explain why European citizens moved in large numbers to Zulu lands in 1867.\nD) A diamond rush ensued following the discovery of diamonds on Zulu lands.

These acts were enacted in response to specific social or economic trends during the 1800s. Based on the context provided, the most likely answer is trade protectionism. This is because both acts were aimed at restricting immigration for economic reasons. The Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 was aimed at preventing the entry of non-European laborers, who were seen as a threat to Australian workers and industries. Similarly, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was aimed at excluding Chinese laborers from entering the United States, due to concerns that their presence would lead to increased competition for jobs and lower wages for American workers.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Lenin saw capitalism as a system that exploited the working class and created vast inequalities. He believed that the only way to overcome these problems was through a socialist revolution that would seize control of the means of production and distribution and create a society based on equality and collective ownership.

Instead, he returned determined to change his country and convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. He would try to lead; but where education and persuasion were not enough, he could drive—and if necessary flog—the backward nation forward.\nBased on this information, we can determine that Peter the Great continued the practice of centralization of power in Russia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to modernize Russia and his willingness to use force suggest a belief in decentralizing power and empowering the people to participate in the decision-making process. However, the text states that Peter returned from Europe determined not only to change his country but also convinced that if Russia was to be transformed, it was he who must provide both the direction and the motive force. This suggests that Peter did not believe in decentralizing power or empowering the people to participate in decision-making processes. Therefore, the answer is B.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. The text provided is an excerpt from a speech given by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 C.E. The speech was given to rally support for the First Crusade, which aimed to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The Crusades.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe. However, the text specifically mentions that the Pope's call was in response to the pleas of the holy city of Jerusalem itself, which had been held captive by 'His enemies.' This detail aligns more closely with the Crusades, where European Christians responded to the Pope's calls for military assistance to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that during the Yuan Dynasty, there were policies of religious toleration in place in Hangzhou, allowing for the peaceful coexistence and thriving of Muslim communities in the city.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of Muslim communities and their influence suggests that foreigners likely held significant administrative positions in Yuan China. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire was known for its military prowess and rapid expansion, which often involved the conquest of various territories and peoples. However, unlike some other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds, the Mongols did not generally impose their religious beliefs on the people whom they conquered. Instead, they often allowed the local populations to continue practicing their own religions. This approach helped to minimize religious tensions and conflicts within the Mongol Empire, which in turn contributed to its overall stability and success.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' vast empire and efficient postal system suggest they often took over territory peacefully, establishing order and communication networks. In contrast to this peaceful expansion, the other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds, such as Rome, Persia, China, and Europe, were characterized by frequent wars, territorial disputes, and cultural conflicts. Therefore, one way in which the Mongol Empire was very different from the other major empires of the ancient and medieval worlds is that it expanded peacefully through efficient communication networks, rather than through war and conquest.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. These reasons include the decline in moral values, the military becoming a source of corruption, and the empire becoming too large to be effectively governed. These reasons could also apply to other classical empires that experienced periods of decline and eventual fall.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The factors leading to the Roman Empire's decline, such as overexpansion and internal strife, are also applicable to other classical empires like the Qin and Etruscan. These empires, too, experienced periods of great expansion followed by internal conflicts and external pressures that ultimately led to their decline.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writings were primarily focused on the concept of neo-colonialism and its impact on less developed countries. Neo-colonialism refers to a situation where a less developed country is economically, politically or culturally dependent on a more developed country. In this context, Nkrumah's writings are best understood in the context of decolonization, which was the process by which less developed countries gained their independence from colonial powers. Therefore, option B is the best answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writing likely emerged during the Industrial Revolution, as he criticizes the exploitation of less developed nations by industrialized powers. However, the best context for his writings is decolonization. Nkrumah was a key figure in the Pan-African movement and the drive towards African independence from European colonial rule. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text discusses the Mongol empire and its impact on international contact, particularly in terms of facilitating trade and the spread of ideas, inventions, and foods between civilizations. Based on this context, it is clear that the correct answer is religious tolerance (Option D). This is because the text mentions that 'From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property.' This statement implies that there was a high degree of peace and security in the Mongol empire, which facilitated international trade and contact. Furthermore, the text mentions that 'The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere.' This statement implies that there was a high degree of cultural exchange and interaction between different civilizations in the Mongol empire. Given this context, it is clear that religious tolerance was an important aspect of the Mongol empire's impact on international contact and cultural exchange.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. This is supported by the text, which mentions that Chinggis Khan first promulgated a law code that ordered human interaction, resulting in an important new stage in international contact. From this, it can be inferred that the Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia. Among the given options, option C seems to be the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon. The passage mentions that Persia's location sat astride international trade routes with India. This strategic position would have facilitated the exchange of goods and ideas between the two regions. Buddhism, being one of the major religions of ancient India, would have been among the ideas that spread through these trade networks. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia can be attributed to the facilitation of cultural exchange through international trade routes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Persia's location on major trade routes between India and the West likely facilitated the spread of Buddhism and the establishment of Buddhist communities within the empire. Therefore, option C is the best explanation for the presence of Buddhist communities within Sassanid Persia.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given poem is written in a free verse style, which is a characteristic feature of avant-garde literary styles. Therefore, it can be inferred that the poem belongs to the modern cultural development described in option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong expressed hopes that the socialist transformation of agriculture would bring prosperity to all rural people. However, if option C were to occur, it would most undermine these hopes. The cooperatives and emphasis on countryside steel production mentioned in option C could lead to famine and poverty for the Chinese peasantry.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. However, the development described in option C would most undermine the hopes expressed by Mao in the second-to-last line of the passage. The famine and poverty brought about by the cooperatives and countryside steel production would not only harm the Chinese peasantry but also weaken their support for the worker-peasant alliance.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text provided is an excerpt from the North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949. This treaty was created in response to the threat of aggression from outside of Western Europe. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty likely aimed to maintain the balance of power in Europe by creating a system of alliances and deterring potential aggressors. This is consistent with option B, which describes a secret treaty to maintain the balance of power in Europe.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage describes the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was the first significant law restricting immigration to the United States. This law was primarily aimed at excluding Chinese laborers from entering the country due to concerns about their impact on employment and wages for American workers. Therefore, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 can be regarded as the cornerstone of the Australian Migrant Exclusion Campaign.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act aimed to diversify the Australian economy by attracting skilled laborers from various European countries and limiting unskilled labor.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Colonel Bonesteel's efforts to establish a surrender zone in Korea during the late 1940s. The Soviet Union entered Korea at this time, and Bonesteel was trying to prevent them from seizing all of Korea. The text mentions that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea or were already there, and that the nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. Based on this information, it is clear that the Soviet Union entered Korea due to the power vacuum left by the withdrawal of Japanese forces from Korea at the end of World War II. The correct answer is C: World War II.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a consequence of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict with implications for territorial control in Asia. The war saw significant gains for Russia, including the acquisition of new territories and the expansion of its influence in Europe and Asia. In the context of this historical event, it is plausible that the Soviet Union's entry into Korea was motivated by a desire to secure its interests and expand its influence in the region.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the difficulties faced by native Siberians in fulfilling their tribute obligations to Russian authorities. The passage mentions several factors that contribute to these difficulties, including the lack of furbearing animals due to overhunting and the forced sale of horses to yasak collectors. However, the passage does not mention anything about the impact of climate change or reduced demand for furs on native Siberians' ability to fulfill their tribute obligations. Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, it is unlikely that either C or D would have been significant factors contributing to added difficulties for native Siberians attempting to fulfill their tribute obligations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the scarcity of fur-bearing animals, which suggests a change in the environment like global warming that makes it harder for the natives to hunt and pay tribute. However, none of the options mention this possibility. Instead, they focus on external factors that could have affected the natives' ability to fulfill their obligations. Among these factors, option B seems the most plausible as it refers to epidemic diseases brought by Russian settlers, which could have decimated native populations and made it difficult for them to hunt and pay tribute.",B

It also describes how the Indians were forced to work long hours under harsh conditions, and that they were not paid for their labor. They were also not provided with adequate food or shelter. The text mentions that the Indians died in large numbers due to these harsh working and living conditions. The text also mentions that there was no remedy for all this, as any colonial official who entered the mines came to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners joined forces in bribing him.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the city of Ghana, which is ruled by a king who is a Muslim. The king's administration includes Muslims in key positions such as interpreters, treasury officials, and ministers. Additionally, only royalty may wear sewn clothes, while all other people wear robes made of cotton, silk, or brocade. This suggests that the Muslim officials in the Ghanaian administration were likely of noble or high status. Therefore, it is most likely that a Muslim being in charge of the Ghanian treasury was due to their high status and expertise in financial matters.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a Muslim overseeing the treasury, which suggests that the king of Ghana had recently converted to Islam and was incorporating Muslim advisors into his administration.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the trade patterns between Europe, China, and Japan during the period 1750-1900 C.E. The Portuguese were bringing silver from Japan and India to exchange for gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things from China. However, the passage also mentions that when the Portuguese came to Canton in China to traffic, they had to remain there only certain days, enter their names in a book, and put out their names at night. They could not lie in the town all night but had to lie in their boats outside of the town. If any man remained there after his time expired, he was imprisoned. These restrictions made it difficult for the Portuguese to maintain a constant presence in Canton and conduct regular trade activities. Therefore, the development that most directly undid the trade patterns mentioned in the first paragraph is likely to be the restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities on the Portuguese traders in Canton.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade system where silver flowed from Japan to China, and this pattern was likely disrupted by Enlightenment revolutions that transformed European societies and economies.
