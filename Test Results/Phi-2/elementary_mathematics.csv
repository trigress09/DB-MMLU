    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Exponential notation is a way of writing numbers that are very large or very small using powers of 10. To convert a number from standard form to exponential form, we need to move the decimal point to the right or left until there is only one non-zero digit before it. Then, we count how many places we moved the decimal point and write that as the exponent of 10. For example, 343 can be written as 3.43 x 10^2 in standard form, which means moving the decimal point two places to the right and writing 2 as the exponent of 10. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A, because 3^7 is equivalent to 343.""

To find the total fraction, we simply need to add the fractions of tomato and chicken noodle soups, resulting in 1/2 + 2/5. However, these two fractions have different denominators, so we must first convert them into equivalent fractions with a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10, so we can multiply 1/2 by 5/5 to get 5/10, and 2/5 by 2/2 to get 4/10.
