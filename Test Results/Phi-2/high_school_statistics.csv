He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. A 95 percent confidence interval is constructed using the formula: p̂ ± z*(√p̂(1-p̂)/n), where p̂ is the sample proportion, n is the sample size and z* is the critical value for a 95% confidence level (which is 1.96).

A,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartiles of a distribution. To find these values, we first need to calculate the median (Q2) which is the middle value in this case. Since there are an even number of data points, Q2 will be the average of the two middle values. In this case, Q2 = 645,000 square feet. The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the first half of the data and the upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the second half of the data. Since there are an even number of data points, we need to take the average of the two middle values in each half. In this case, Q1 = 615,000 square feet and Q3 = 645,000 square feet.

The standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes can be calculated using the formula sqrt(w1^2 + w2^2 + ... + wn^2), where w1, w2, ... ,wn are the variances of the individual components. In this case, we have three components: the weight of books, the weight of boxes, and the weight of packing material. The variance of the weights of books is (25-25)^2 = 0, since all books weigh the same. The variance of the weights of boxes is (1-1)^2 = 0, for the same reason. The variance of the weights of packing material is (2-2)^2 = 0. Therefore, the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes is sqrt(0 + 0 + 0) = 0.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the total weight is simply the sum of the standard deviations of the books, boxes, and packing material, which is 2 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 2.4 pounds. However, this does not account for the fact that the weights are normally distributed within each category. To find the standard deviation of the total weight, we need to use the formula sqrt(sum((x - mean)^2)/n), where x is the individual weight, mean is the average weight, and n is the number of items. In this case, we have four categories: books, boxes, and packing material. The mean weight of each category is 25 pounds for books, 1 pound for boxes, and 2 pounds for packing material. Therefore, the standard deviation of the total weight is sqrt(sum((x - mean)^2)/n), where x = (25 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 10.67 pounds, mean = 10.67 pounds, and n = 4.

Similarly, the probability of Semir rolling a 3 or larger is also 1/6, and the probability of him being late for school if he has a lighter breakfast is 6%. Therefore, the probability that he will be on time for school given that he had a lighter breakfast is (1-0.06)/(1/6) = 0.86.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The student's z-score on the midterm is (58 - 52) / 4 = 1, which means she scored one standard deviation above the mean. Since her final exam score was also approximately normally distributed with a mean of 112 points and a standard deviation of 10 points, we can use the same formula to find her z-score for that exam: (z-score) = (final exam score - mean) / standard deviation = (112 - 52) / 10 = 6. Therefore, if she had the same z-score on the final exam as she did on the midterm, her final exam score must have been 112 + 1 * 4 = 116 points.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

We can use the formula z = (x - mu) / sigma to calculate the z-score for the midterm and final exam scores. The mean of the midterm is 52 and the standard deviation is 4, so the student's z-score on the midterm is (58 - 52) / 4 = 1.5.

In this case, we have p̂ = 0.08, n = 500, and z = 1.96 (from a normal distribution table). Plugging these values into the formula, we get (0.08 - 1.96*(0.04/√500))/(1+1.96*(0.04/√500)), which simplifies to 0.025. Therefore, the midpoint for a 95% confidence interval estimate of p is 0.025.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the midpoint of the interval is 0.08 + 0.025 = 0.105. This means that we are 95% confident that the true proportion of unemployed people in the city lies between 0.05 and 0.15.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. All possible outcomes must be numerical, mutually exclusive and have a finite number of values. The last statement is false because it does not hold for all discrete random variables.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since discrete random variables follow a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the outcomes will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, statement D is false.",D
D,Let's reason step by step. The best plan of action would be to use the surveys that were returned and leave the sample size at 75 for the analysis.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Since 27 surveys were not returned, the sample size should be adjusted to 48 for analysis to maintain accuracy. This is because a smaller sample size can lead to biased results and inaccurate conclusions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is one in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. In this case, every student entering the school has a 1/25 chance of being selected, so it is indeed a simple random sample.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As long as there is a single entrance to the school, selecting every 25th student ensures that each student has an equal chance of being selected, resulting in a simple random sample. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval is a range of values that we can be reasonably sure contains the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. The width of this interval depends on several factors, including the sample size and the standard deviation of the data. When we triple the sample size, we increase the precision of our estimate by reducing the standard error of the mean. This means that the margin of error decreases, which in turn reduces the width of the confidence interval. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tripling the sample size reduces the standard error by a factor of square root of 3, which is approximately 1.732. Therefore, the confidence interval size is multiplied by 1.732. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the random variable W is given as 992 pounds, which means that if we select four players at random, their total combined weight will be close to this number on average. We can use the formula for the standard deviation of a sample mean to find the approximate standard deviation of Wis. The formula is sqrt(n/4)*sigma_w^2, where n is the sample size (which is 4 in this case) and sigma_w^2 is the variance of the weights of the four players. We know that the average weight of a player is 248 pounds, so the variance can be calculated as (248-W)^2/4 = (248-992)/4 = -532/4 = -133 pounds. Therefore, sigma_w^2 = 133 pounds^2. Substituting these values in the formula, we get sqrt(4/4)*133 = 13.25 pounds. The standard deviation of Wis is approximately 13.25 pounds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. So, the standard deviation of W is sqrt(4 * 47^2) = 94 pounds. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile is the value that separates the lowest 40% of the data from the highest 60%. In this case, it means that 40% of the bags weigh less than or equal to 0.40 ounce. To find the mean weight, we need to add up all the weights and divide by 16 (since there are 16 ounces in a bag). The mean weight is approximately 1.15 ounce. Therefore, the weight of a bag at the 40th percentile is 0.35 ounce below the mean.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.25. Therefore, the weight of a bag at the 40th percentile is 0.25 * 0.28 = 0.07 ounces above the mean. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference in mean cholesterol level lowering is (18, 41). This means that we are 95% confident that the true difference between the two drugs lies somewhere within this range. Since Lipitor outperformed niacin in the study, it is reasonable to conclude that Lipitor lowers cholesterol an average of at least 18 points more than niacin.",C,Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies a 95% probability that any individual's cholesterol reduction with Lipitor will fall within the given range compared to niacin. This means that there is a 95% chance that Lipitor will outperform niacin in lowering cholesterol levels.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The z-score of -2.46 indicates that the sample mean is 2.46 standard deviations below the population mean, which is in line with our expectations given the production process change. The P-value of 0.0069 is less than the significance level of 0.05, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis that the new process has no effect on thrust. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence to support the claim that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.0069 means there's a 0.69% chance that an engine produced with the new process will have a thrust greater than the original mean of 9500 pounds. This is not statistically significant, so we cannot conclude that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. A standardized score is a measure of how many standard deviations an individual's value is from the mean. In this case, we know that the student's time was 2.4 seconds, which is 0.04 standard deviations above the mean. If we convert this to minutes (which has 60 seconds), then the student's new time will be 4 minutes. Therefore, their standardized score will still be z = 0.04.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Converting seconds to minutes involves dividing by 60, so the z-score should also be divided by 60, resulting in a new z-score of 0.04. Therefore, the answer is A.",A

A control group is a group of subjects who do not receive the experimental treatment, but are otherwise similar to the other groups in all respects except for the one that differs between them.

Therefore, the best control group would be A: a third group for which no music is played.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A good control group should experience elements of both treatments to isolate the effects of each music genre, so a group randomly exposed to classical or rock music would be ideal. However, this does not account for the possibility that participants may have different preferences for one genre over another. Therefore, a third group that hears no music at all would serve as an appropriate control.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling is a type of probability sampling that involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata based on some characteristic(s) and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This method has several advantages over simple random sampling, including less bias, more variability control, and better estimates for smaller sample sizes. However, it does not provide information about each stratum in the population as well as a simple random sample does.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. An experiment is a type of study in which the researcher manipulates some variable (the independent variable) and observes its effect on another variable (the dependent variable). The goal is to establish causality between the two variables. In contrast, an observational study simply observes and records the observations without manipulating any variables. Therefore, the primary difference between experiments and observational studies is that in experiments, the researcher manipulates some variable to observe its effect on a response variable; in observational studies, he or she simply observes and records the observations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The main difference lies in the use of control and treatment groups; while both methods utilize these groups, experiments require randomization to ensure unbiased results, whereas observational studies don't. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A confidence interval is a range of values that we can be reasonably sure contains the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.

The company should choose Option II if it wants to maximize expected return.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize expected return, the company should choose Option II, as it has the highest average potential return of $30,000 compared to the other options. However, if the company needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan, then it should choose Option I, as it guarantees a minimum return of $25,000. If the company needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan, then it should choose Option III, as it has the highest probability of returning nothing and therefore does not pose any risk to the company's financial stability.",A

Now, we know that 60% of parts last over 3 years, so their mean life expectancy is 3+1 = 4 years. The remaining 40% have a mean life expectancy of 7-4 = 3 years.

Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes.
