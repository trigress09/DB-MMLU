Applying De Morgan's Law to the first proposition, we get ~(G ⊃ H) • ~~H, which simplifies to (~G • ~H) • H. This looks similar to the second proposition (~G ⊃ G), suggesting they might be contradictory. However, if we look at the truth tables for both propositions, we can see that they are not equivalent and do not contradict each other. Therefore, the answer is neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cecilia breaks my heart if, and only if, Maria is either a problem or a girl.
