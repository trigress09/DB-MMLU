D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate of energy expenditure is the product of the mean rate of oxygen consumption and the respiratory quotient (RQ). The RQ is a measure of how efficiently an organism uses different fuels for respiration, such as carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. For humans, the average RQ during aerobic exercise is about 0.8, meaning that 80% of the energy produced by the oxidation of glucose comes from oxygen and 20% from other sources. Therefore, if the mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 l/min, then the rate of energy expenditure is approximately 1.6 kJ/min.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen consumption is related to energy expenditure, but the conversion is not very efficient, so an oxygen consumption of 2 L/min would translate to roughly 80 kJ/min of energy expenditure. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The contraction of skeletal muscle is initiated when calcium ions bind to tropomyosin, exposing the myosin-binding sites on actin filaments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves the interaction of actin and myosin filaments, which is regulated by the binding of potassium ions to myosin, triggering the contractile process. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Jaundice is the yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Bilirubin is a waste product that results from the breakdown of red blood cells. In haemolytic anaemia, there is an increased rate of red blood cell destruction, leading to elevated levels of bilirubin. Therefore, pale stools and dark urine are characteristic of the jaundice of haemalytic anaemia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Jaundice is caused by a buildup of bilirubin, which is a component of heme, the molecule responsible for oxygen transport in red blood cells, so the liver must use bilirubin in the production of red blood cells. Therefore, B is false.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Collagen fibres are the main structural component of connective tissue, which provides strength and elasticity to the skin and other organs. When a wound occurs, the body initiates a complex process of inflammation, coagulation, granulation, and remodeling that involves various cells and molecules. The first five days of wound healing are crucial for the formation of a stable extracellular matrix that will support the growth of new tissue. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Collagen is a key structural protein in the skin, and its production is accelerated during wound healing, so it's likely that collagen fibers are re-established within the first five days of the process. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A large goitre is an enlargement of the thyroid gland that can cause compression of nearby structures, such as the trachea and oesophagus. Stridor is a high-pitched sound produced when air passes through a narrowed airway due to obstruction. Dysphagia is difficulty in swallowing food or liquids. Hoarseness is a change in the voice quality caused by inflammation or swelling of the vocal cords. A more florid thyrotoxicosis is an exaggerated form of hyperthyroidism that can cause symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and tremors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A larger goitre is associated with more thyroid tissue, which leads to a higher production of thyroid hormones, causing a more severe thyrotoxicosis. Stridor and hoarseness are symptoms of compression of the airway or vocal cords, respectively, but not necessarily due to a large goitre. Dysphagia can be caused by many factors, including a large goitre, but it is not an indication for surgery. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinase reactions are biochemical processes that involve the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to other molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. This process is essential for many cellular functions, including signal transduction, gene expression, and cell cycle regulation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze reactions involving ATP, which is the main energy currency of the cell, so they must be involved in the breakdown of ATP to release energy. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Catheter bags are used to collect urine from patients who have difficulty urinating on their own. The size of the bag depends on the patient's needs and the frequency of urination. At night, when a patient is likely to sleep for several hours without needing to use the bathroom, a larger catheter bag may be necessary to accommodate the increased volume of urine produced during the day.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A 350ml catheter bag should be enough for nighttime use, as urine production decreases during sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The cuff is inflated in order to stop blood flow to the arm, which allows for a more accurate measurement of blood pressure. However, if the cuff is inflated too high, it can cause discomfort and even pain for the patient. This may make them unable to speak or communicate effectively.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When the cuff is inflated, it blocks the trachea, preventing air from reaching the lungs, which makes it impossible for the patient to breathe in sufficiently and therefore to talk. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The apolipoprotein E gene is associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The apolipoprotein E gene is known to be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, so there must be a link between the two.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A protein is a large molecule made up of one or more chains of amino acids that are linked together through covalent bonds. The type of bond that links the amino acids in a protein is called a peptide bond, which is formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycosidic bonds are covalent bonds that link monosaccharides together to form polysaccharides, and proteins are essentially polymers of amino acids, so glycosidic bonds must be involved in linking amino acids. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen peroxide is a strong oxidizing agent that can damage the soft tissues of the mouth, including the gums and tongue. Water is neutral and does not have any special properties for cleaning the mouth. Lemon and glycerine swabs are acidic and may cause irritation or burning sensations in the mouth. Normal saline is a sterile solution that can help rinse away debris and bacteria from the mouth without causing harm.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen peroxide is a common antiseptic used to clean wounds and prevent infection, so it should be effective for cleaning the mouth as well. Water is also an essential component of saliva, which helps to wash away food particles and bacteria in the mouth. Lemon and glycerine swabs are not recommended for cleaning the mouth because they can cause irritation and damage to the delicate tissues in the mouth. Normal saline is used to clean wounds but it is not effective for cleaning the mouth.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The optic chiasma is the point where the optic nerves from each eye cross over to join together. A lesion at this point would cause a homonymous hemianopia, which means that the patient would lose vision in half of their visual field on one side. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The optic chiasma is where the optic nerves from each eye partially cross, so a lesion there would affect the same half of the visual field in both eyes, leading to a homonymous hemianopia. In contrast, impulses from the retina leave the eye via the optic radiation and do not affect the visual field. An enlarged blind spot may occur because of papilloedema, but this is not necessarily true for all patients with papilloedema. Finally, the visual field examination maps out a patient's central vision, so the correct answer is A.",A
B,Let's reason step by step. The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate results in the net formation of six molecules of water and two molecules of ATP.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate is the first step of cellular respiration, which is a highly efficient process that generates a large amount of ATP, around 38 molecules per glucose molecule.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Bronchial breathing is characterized by inspiratory components that are louder and longer than the expiratory ones, and there is a gap between them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bronchial breathing is a type of abnormal breath sound that is louder and longer during inspiration, with a short pause between inspiration and expiration. This indicates that the airways are partially obstructed or narrowed, which can be caused by various conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or lung cancer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Before catheterizing, it is important to follow proper procedures and protocols to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient. Patient consent must be obtained before any invasive procedure, so option A is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. It's important to maintain a sterile environment during catheterization to prevent infection, so washing the patient beforehand is a crucial step. Checking expiry dates and gaining consent are also necessary steps, but they do not directly relate to maintaining sterility.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of converting genetic information from mRNA into a sequence of amino acids that make up proteins. This process requires three key components: mRNA (which carries the genetic code), tRNA (which brings the corresponding amino acid to the ribosome), and ribosomes (which catalyze the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of converting the genetic information encoded in DNA into proteins, so it must involve DNA, mRNA, and the enzyme responsible for synthesizing mRNA, which is RNA polymerase. Ribosomes are also involved because they provide a platform for protein synthesis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A pulsatile abdominal mass could be due to aortic aneurysm, but it can also be due to other conditions such as liver abscess or perforated peptic ulcer. An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion because of the presence of fat in the renal capsule. A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst, but it can also be due to other conditions such as bladder or uterine cancer. An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon, but it can also be due to other conditions such as abscess or hernia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An enlarged kidney is a solid mass, and solid masses are typically dull to percussion, so an enlarged kidney should also be dull to percussion. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's preference for a silicone catheter has nothing to do with the medical knowledge. However, if the patient is allergic to latex, then using a latex-free catheter would be necessary. Silicone catheters are also available in different sizes and shapes, so there may be other reasons why you might choose to use one over another.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a patient cannot tolerate other types of catheters due to allergies or other reasons, then a silicone catheter would be the only viable option. The most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hypovolaemic shock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when there is a significant loss of blood or fluids from the body. This can be due to severe bleeding, dehydration, or other causes. The amount of blood loss that can cause changes in heart rate and blood pressure varies depending on several factors such as age, sex, and overall health status. However, generally speaking, it takes about 5% of total blood volume before these changes are noticeable.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body has compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure and heart rate, so significant changes in these parameters would only occur after a substantial blood loss, around 20%. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Spastic paraplegia refers to a group of neurological disorders that cause progressive weakness and stiffness in the legs. The most common form of spastic paraplegia is hereditary, meaning it is passed down through families. In this case, the most appropriate answer is multiple sclerosis can cause this neurological pattern.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Spastic paraplegia involves muscle stiffness and hypertonia, so the tone wouldn't be flaccid; it would be closer to normal or even slightly elevated. Proprioceptive loss is a common feature of multiple sclerosis but not spastic paraplegia. Coordination in the legs can be affected by spasticity, but this doesn't necessarily mean that coordination is completely lost. The most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's response is a set of symptoms that occur when the body is exposed to high levels of cortisol for an extended period of time. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It helps regulate blood pressure, metabolism, and immune function. When cortisol levels are too high, it can lead to a variety of health problems, including weight gain, high blood pressure, and tachycardia (fast heart rate). In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's response is a reaction to increased intracranial pressure, often leading to a state similar to shock, with low blood pressure and a slowed heart rate to compensate.

However, we can eliminate options A and B as they are not typically acquired in hospitals.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Branched chain amino acids are essential for protein synthesis, but they can also be deaminated into ammonia, which is toxic to cells. The liver converts most of the ammonia into urea and releases it from the body through urine. However, some of the ammonia may also be converted into arginine and released from the muscle as a by-product of metabolism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is toxic, so the muscle needs to convert it into a less harmful substance like arginine before releasing it into the bloodstream. Alanine and glutamine are also amino acids that can be converted into urea in the liver, but not directly from the muscle. Purines and pyrimidines are nucleotides that are synthesised in the cytoplasm of cells, not in the muscle.",A

B,"Let's reason step by step. Central painful stimuli are those that arise from within the central nervous system, such as nerve damage or inflammation. Supra-orbital ridge pressure and pressure on the little finger pulp both involve external forces applied to specific areas of the body, which do not directly affect the central nervous system. Trapezius squeeze involves a deep tissue massage over the trapezius muscle, which is also an external force but does not directly affect the central nervous system. Sternal rub involves rubbing the sternum, which again is an external force and does not involve any direct stimulation of the central nervous system. Therefore, the answer must be D. Sternal rub.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sternal rub involves applying pressure to the chest area, it's more likely to elicit a peripheral pain response rather than a central one.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The jugular venous pulse is a clinical sign that can be used to assess the right ventricular function and the presence of heart failure. It involves observing the pulsations in the jugular veins, which are located on either side of the neck. To obtain an accurate assessment, several factors should be taken into account. First, the patient's neck muscles should be relaxed, as any tension can interfere with the visibility of the pulse. Second, timing the pulsation with the radial pulse is important to ensure that they are synchronized. Third, good lighting is necessary to clearly see the veins and their pulsations. Finally, the patient lying at a 45 degree angle may help to visualize the jugular veins more easily.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Clear visualization of the jugular venous pulse is crucial for accurate assessment, making good lighting a primary requirement. The patient's neck muscles should be relaxed to avoid any interference with the pulsation. Timing the pulsation with the radial pulse helps in synchronizing the two pulses and provides more accurate readings. Patient lying at 45 degree angle can also help in better visualization of the jugular venous pulse.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of creatine and ADP to phosphocreatine and ATP, which are important for energy metabolism in muscle cells. An increase in its activity would indicate a higher demand for ATP production, which could be due to increased intracellular ADP levels or decreased pH. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When muscle pH falls, indicating increased acidity and potentially anaerobic conditions, the demand for ATP production rises, thus requiring higher creatine kinase activity. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of a cell is defined as the ratio between the amount of ATP and ADP in the cell, divided by the sum of these two molecules. This gives us an idea about how much energy is available for cellular processes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of a cell is related to its electrical properties, specifically the difference in charge between the intracellular and extracellular environments. This difference is generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which pumps three sodium ions out of the cell for every two potassium ions it brings in. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bleeding haemorrhoids can lead to melaena per rectum (PR), which is a condition where blood from the rectum enters the stool and causes it to turn black or tarry. This indicates that the bleeding is coming from the lower part of the rectum, which is more likely to be caused by first degree haemorrhoids. Pregnancy can also cause haemorrhoids due to increased pressure on the veins in the pelvic region, but this does not necessarily mean that all pregnant women will develop them. Bleeding from first degree haemorrhoids is usually painless and may only occur during bowel movements or when straining. Second degree haemorrhoids can be returned to the anal canal, although they are more likely to prolapse (slip out) than first degree haemorrhoids. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As haemorrhoids progress to more severe stages, they become increasingly difficult to return to their normal position within the anal canal. This is because the veins that support them have been damaged and are no longer able to function properly.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for about 2 seconds at high intensity exercise, after which the body will switch to anaerobic metabolism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high energy requirements of intense exercise, ATP stores can likely provide fuel for around 10 seconds before other energy systems become dominant. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. High force contractions are very short and intense, requiring a rapid energy source. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP in the process. Creatine phosphorylation is the second stage of cellular respiration that converts creatine phosphate to ATP, providing an additional burst of energy. Phosphocreatine stores are a form of stored creatine phosphate that can be quickly converted to ATP during high-intensity exercise. However, these sources cannot sustain high force contractions for more than a few seconds. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine serves as a readily available energy reserve, making it the primary source for short bursts of intense muscle activity. Glycolysis and ATP are both important sources of energy but they take longer to produce energy than phosphocreatine. Creatine phosphorylation is also an important process that produces energy but it takes even longer than glycolysis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increase, the body's ability to produce energy aerobically decreases and it starts relying more on anaerobic metabolism. This leads to a progressive increase in the contribution of anaerobic metabolism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increases, anaerobic metabolism becomes more prominent, resulting in a substantial decrease in muscle pH, potentially below 6.0. This is because as the intensity of exercise increases, so does the demand for energy production. The body's primary source of energy during high-intensity exercise is ATP produced through glycolysis and phosphocreatine resynthesis. However, this process produces lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the muscle tissue.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral neuropathy refers to a group of disorders that affect the peripheral nervous system, which includes nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. One common symptom is sensory loss, which can be demonstrated in a stocking distribution pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral neuropathy affects the lower motor neurons, which can lead to muscle weakness and spasticity, resulting in increased tone in the legs. Sensory loss is not demonstrated in a stocking distribution but rather in a mononeuropathy. Reflexes are usually decreased or absent due to denervation of the affected nerve. Weakness is more marked distally than proximally.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are non-protein molecules that bind to proteins, such as enzymes, to enhance or regulate their function.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are typically small molecules that associate with enzymes through relatively weak hydrogen bonds, allowing for dynamic interactions. This means they can be easily removed or added to the enzyme without significantly altering its activity. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The carpal bones are the small bones of the wrist that form a complex structure to support and move the hand. They can be divided into two groups based on their location: proximal and distal. Proximal carpal bones include scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, trapezium, and trapezoid. Distal carpal bones include capitate, hamate, and the small carpal bones that form the wrist joint. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The carpal bones form the foundation of the wrist joint and include the radius, ulna, and several smaller bones like the scaphoid and lunate. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training is a type of exercise that involves sustained, low-intensity activity over a long period of time. This type of training leads to adaptations in the muscle tissue, such as an increase in capillaries and mitochondria, which allow for more efficient energy production. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training primarily targets the aerobic energy system and muscle fiber adaptations, which can enhance the speed of muscle contractions. However, it does not directly affect the breakdown of phosphocreatine or the generation of energy anaerobically. The most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A Colles fracture is a type of wrist fracture that occurs when the distal radius (the bone on the thumb side) breaks near the wrist joint. This can happen due to a fall onto an outstretched hand, and it typically results in pain, swelling, and limited range of motion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A Colles fracture involves a break in the radius bone near the wrist, which is closely connected to the elbow joint, making it essentially an elbow fracture. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Chronic cough is a common symptom that can be caused by various factors, including respiratory infections, allergies, and lifestyle habits. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a condition in which stomach acid flows back into the oesophagus, causing irritation and inflammation of the lining. ACE inhibitors are medications used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure by relaxing blood vessels and reducing fluid retention. Long-term smoking can cause chronic bronchitis and emphysema, both of which involve inflammation and damage to the airways. Sodium valproate is a medication used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder, but it can also cause cough as a side effect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While smoking can cause various respiratory problems, chronic cough is not typically a direct consequence of long-term smoking. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and ACE inhibitors are both known to cause coughing as side effects. Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant medication that has been linked to cough in some patients.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The knee joint is a hinge joint that allows flexion and extension of the leg. Flexion refers to bending the leg, while extension refers to straightening it. A normal range for flexion at the knee joint is typically between 0-135 degrees.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The knee joint allows for a moderate range of flexion, typically reaching up to 115 degrees, which is sufficient for most daily movements. An answer that goes beyond this range would be too extreme and impractical.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium metabolism refers to the processes that regulate calcium levels in the body, including absorption, excretion, and storage. One important hormone involved in this process is calcitonin, which helps lower blood calcium levels. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to increased bone resorption and elevated blood calcium levels. Vitamin D is actually produced by the skin in response to sunlight exposure and plays a role in calcium absorption from the gut. Oliguria, or decreased urine output, can be a symptom of hypercalcaemia, but it is not always present. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcitonin is a hormone involved in calcium regulation, and its release leads to an increase in plasma calcium levels. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and bone pain. Vitamin D is also secreted by the parathyroid glands, but it plays a role in calcium absorption rather than regulation. Oliguria is a symptom of hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels), not hypercalcaemia (high blood calcium levels). In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the trachea, or windpipe, through the neck. This allows for easier breathing and can be used to help patients who are having difficulty breathing on their own. In this case, the most appropriate answer is as an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy involves creating an opening in the trachea to establish an alternate airway, which can assist with swallowing difficulties. It is also used as a temporary measure for patients who are unable to breathe on their own and require mechanical ventilation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. Coring is the process of withdrawing medication straight into the bloodstream. This method is used when the drug needs to be delivered quickly and directly to the site of action.,C,"Let's reason step by step.

This process ensures that the medication has its desired effect without causing any harm to the patient.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The primary transcripts of many genes can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs, a process known as alternative RNA splicing.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the mRNA molecule is longer, it would contain more codons, which could code for different amino acids and therefore different proteins. This is not possible because each codon codes for only one amino acid.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The elbow is a synovial hinge joint, which means that it allows for movement in one plane only (flexion and extension) while maintaining stability. This type of joint is found in the wrist and knee as well.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The elbow joint allows for a wide range of motion, similar to the shoulder, so it must be a ball and socket joint. A fused joint is one where two bones have grown together, which does not apply here. A synovial hinge joint would allow for bending but not rotation, which also does not apply here. Finally, a plain joint is one without any movement at all, which is not the case with the elbow.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The minimum time a stretch should be held for is the amount of time it takes to achieve the desired effect, which varies depending on the individual and their goals. In general, holding a stretch for at least 30 seconds can help improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Holding a stretch for a short period of time, like 0-10 seconds, should be enough to increase flexibility. However, holding it for longer periods of time, such as 30-50 seconds or 60 seconds, can help improve muscle strength and endurance.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Radial nerve palsy is a condition in which there is damage or dysfunction of the radial nerve, which runs from the neck down to the forearm and controls movement and sensation on the medial half of the hand. This can be caused by various factors such as trauma, inflammation, tumors, or compression. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The radial nerve is located near the ulna bone, so it makes sense that damage to it would affect the medial side of the hand. Additionally, the radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for wrist flexion and extension, which explains why wrist drop occurs in cases of radial nerve palsy.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration and involves the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP. Lipolysis is the breakdown of lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, while gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids or lactate. In this case, the most appropriate answer is glycogenolysis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The synthesis of glucose from other molecules sounds similar to the breakdown of lipids, so it must be lipolysis. Glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, and gluconeogenesis is the synthesis of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A surgical support is a device that can be used to provide extra stability and protection for stomas, which are openings created during surgery to allow waste products to exit the body. Prolapse refers to when the stoma protrudes from its normal position, while high output refers to when there is an excessive amount of stool or urine passing through the stoma. Herniation around the stoma occurs when there is a bulge in the abdominal wall that puts pressure on the stoma, and retraction refers to when the stoma pulls back into the abdomen. In this case, the most appropriate answer is prolapsed stomas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A surgical support would help hold the stoma in place, which is necessary when it is prolapsed. Prolapse occurs when the stoma protrudes out of the abdominal wall and can be caused by a variety of factors such as surgery or trauma.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The cardiovascular system is responsible for maintaining blood pressure and heart rate, so it makes sense that a change in these parameters would be detected by the cardiovascular centre.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The vasomotor center is responsible for controlling blood vessel diameter, so it must be the one detecting changes in blood pressure. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dentures are artificial teeth that replace missing natural teeth and help improve the appearance of your smile. They need to be taken out at night, cleaned on removal from mouth, and stored in a named pot with water or denture cleaner.",D,"Let's reason step by step. It's crucial to identify whose dentures are whose, so storing them in a named pot is essential, even if it means they dry out. However, the other options are incorrect because dentures should be removed at night and cleaned on removal from mouth.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A palpable left parasternal impulse is a sign of an abnormality in the heart's structure or function. It can be caused by several conditions, including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is thickening and enlargement of the left ventricle. In this case, the most appropriate answer is LVH.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A palpable impulse on the left side of the sternum suggests increased activity in the nearby aortic valve, likely due to regurgitation. This is because the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed or leaky valve. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The MRC scale is a grading system used to assess the strength of muscles in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Grade 3/5 indicates that the patient can move their arm only when gravity is eliminated, which means they have severe weakness and paralysis. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Grade 3 on the MRC scale means the muscle can move against gravity, so eliminating gravity would allow for even greater movement. This is represented as grade 3/5. Flexion at the elbow is produced by the triceps muscle, not the biceps. The root value of shoulder abduction is C6, not C5. Grade 1 on the MRC scale means no movement or muscle contraction.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Head injury and altered conscious level can cause a variety of abnormal breathing patterns, including Cheyne-Stokes respiration (a series of deep breaths followed by shallow ones), hyperventilation (rapid and shallow breathing), and ataxic breathing (incoordinated movements). Anaerobic respiration is not an abnormal breathing pattern. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperventilation is a common response to anxiety and panic, not typically associated with head injuries. Cheyne-Stokes respiration is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by alternating periods of deep breathing followed by shallow breathing or apnea. Anaerobic respiration refers to the production of energy without oxygen, which can occur in some cases of severe brain injury. Ataxic breathing is a type of irregular breathing that occurs when there is damage to the cerebellum, not typically associated with head injuries.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A pulsation in the neck is a sign that blood is flowing through an artery, which means it's under high pressure. If we look at the options, only one of them suggests that there is no variation with posture - this would be the case for a vein. Therefore, the answer must be either A or B. However, if we consider the other option, positive for hepatojugular reflux, this means that blood is flowing from the liver to the stomach via the jugular vein, which is not under high pressure and therefore cannot cause pulsations in the neck. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Applying pressure to the root of the neck would restrict blood flow in the jugular vein, thus reducing the venous pulsation. This suggests that the pulsation is arterial.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Haematemesis refers to the vomiting of blood, which can be a sign of serious underlying conditions such as peptic ulcers or esophageal varices. A low blood pressure and tachycardia are worrying features that suggest shock, while an alcohol history is not essential but may indicate liver disease. Abdominal pain is always present in some cases, but it is not a universal feature.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Haematemesis can have various causes, so focusing solely on vital signs and abdominal pain is sufficient for diagnosis, regardless of alcohol history. However, a low blood pressure (<90mmHg systolic) and a tachycardia (>100/min) are worrying features that suggest an acute condition such as gastrointestinal bleeding or shock.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to carnitine, which is a transmembrane protein that facilitates their entry into the mitochondrial matrix.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule in fatty acid metabolism, so it makes sense that it would also be involved in their transport into the mitochondria. Coenzyme A (CoA) and thiokinase are both enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways, but they do not play a direct role in fatty acid transport.",C
B,Let's reason step by step. The best approach to the use of analgesic drugs following surgery is to give them regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Giving analgesics only when pain scores are high helps avoid unnecessary medication and potential side effects.

Bowing of long bones is one of the most common features of this disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The characteristic bowing of long bones in Paget's disease may cause pain and mobility issues, but the bones remain strong enough to prevent fractures. Spinal cord compression is more commonly seen in other conditions such as osteoporosis or spinal stenosis. Heart failure is not a recognized complication of Paget's disease, although it can occur due to bone-related complications. Pathological fractures are common in Paget's disease and may require surgical intervention.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral muscle fatigue is a complex phenomenon that can be caused by various factors, including the accumulation of metabolic waste products such as lactic acid and hydrogen ions, depletion of energy stores such as ATP and glycogen, and changes in electrolyte balance. In this case, the most likely answer is an accumulation of inorganic phosphate, which can interfere with muscle contraction and lead to fatigue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Potassium is essential for muscle contractions, so a deficiency could lead to fatigue during intense activities. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Passive movements are those that can be performed on a patient without their active participation or assistance from the therapist. This means that the movement is not resisted by the patient and they do not have to actively engage in it. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Passive movements involve moving a joint through its range of motion, even if it requires some resistance to achieve full stretch. This is different from active movements which require the individual to generate force and movement on their own.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The facial nerve innervates the muscles that control the face, including those responsible for closing the eyelids and moving the mouth. In Bell's palsy, there is a sudden onset of weakness or paralysis on one side of the face due to inflammation of the facial nerve. This results in an inability to close the eyelid on the affected side, which indicates a lower motor neurone lesion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bell's palsy is a condition that affects the facial nerve, causing weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles, which is a characteristic of an upper motor neurone lesion. Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is also an upper motor neurone lesion but it is secondary to a Herpes Zoster infection and not Bell's Palsy.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power is the highest rate of work that can be performed for an extended period without fatigue. This power is determined by a variety of factors, including the athlete's fitness level and diet. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B because as the distance of the race increases, the body will begin to rely more heavily on stored energy sources such as muscle glycogen, which can lead to a decline in performance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power is the highest level of effort an athlete can maintain over a prolonged period, so it should remain relatively constant during a race. In fact, it's usually improved by training and conditioning.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Catheterization is a procedure that involves inserting a tube into the urinary tract to drain urine or administer medication. It can be done for various reasons, such as diagnosing and treating urinary tract infections (UTIs), monitoring kidney function, or managing incontinence. However, catheterization also carries some risks, such as infection, bleeding, or injury to surrounding organs. Therefore, it is important to use antibiotics prior to catheterization to prevent the introduction of bacteria into the urinary tract and reduce the risk of complications.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Catheterization carries a risk of introducing bacteria into the urinary tract, so using antibiotics beforehand would help prevent urinary tract infections. However, there are certain circumstances in which this is not necessary. For example, if the patient has had a catheter in situ for a week or more, they may have developed a tolerance to the bacteria and thus do not need antibiotics. Similarly, if the patient does not have an underlying condition that predisposes them to urinary tract infections (such as diabetes), then antibiotics are likely unnecessary. In addition, using antibiotics prior to catheterization carries its own risks, such as increasing the risk of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Wound drainage should be assessed for volume and consistency to monitor the progress of healing, identify any signs of infection or complications, and adjust treatment accordingly. In this case, the most appropriate answer is daily.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In addition, this location also allows for easy access to the surrounding tissues in case of any complications.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mixed mitral valve disease is a condition in which both the mitral and tricuspid valves are affected, leading to a combination of symptoms such as a displaced apex beat, soft first heart sound, pan-systolic murmur, and short mid-diastolic murmur. Irregular pulse, irregular first heart sound, ejection systolic murmur, and long mid-diastolic murmur are all signs of mitral stenosis, which is a different condition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A pan-systolic murmur suggests mitral regurgitation, and a long mid-diastolic murmur can indicate increased blood flow through the mitral valve, which is also characteristic of mitral regurgitation. The other features listed are not typically associated with mixed mitral valve disease.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 𝛿-oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms from each carbon atom in the chain, resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA and water. This process requires oxygen as an electron acceptor. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid has 16 carbon atoms, and each cycle of beta-oxidation removes two carbons, so the process should yield 16 molecules of acetyl-CoA. However, this is not the case.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Abduction of the thumb and opposition of the thumb are both movements that involve flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which is supplied by spinal root T1. Finger adduction involves extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which is supplied by the median nerve. Finger abduction involves extension at the metacarpophalangeal joint, which is mediated by the palmar interossei. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The T2 spinal root, located near the base of the neck, is responsible for innervating the muscles involved in thumb abduction, allowing for movement away from the palm. On the other hand, the T1 spinal root supplies the muscles responsible for thumb opposition, enabling the thumb to touch or press against another finger. Therefore, the correct answer is A.""

D,"Let's reason step by step. A controlled drug is a medication that has the potential for abuse and addiction, so it must be regulated by law to prevent misuse. In this case, all of the options are drugs that can be abused or habit-forming, except for the Morphine tablet which is a sustained release form of the drug.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Injectable opioids, like the 30 milligram ampoule of Codeine Phosphate, are classified as controlled drugs due to their high potential for addiction and abuse. Sustained release Morphine tablets and Fentanyl patches are also considered controlled drugs because they deliver a constant dose over an extended period of time. However, oral suspension of Morphine 10 mg in 5 ml is not a controlled drug since it can be easily administered orally without the risk of injection-related complications.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Drugs that cause a dry mouth are known as xerostomia. They work by reducing the production of saliva, which can lead to discomfort and difficulty in speaking or swallowing. Steroids, analgesics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents may all have this effect on some individuals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Steroids can disrupt fluid balance and hormone levels in the body, potentially leading to reduced saliva production and dry mouth as a side effect. Analgesics may also cause this side effect, but it is less common than with steroids. Antidepressants are not known to cause dry mouth, while antifungal agents may have an opposite effect by increasing saliva production.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The prescribed dose is 1.5 mg, which is equivalent to 1500 micrograms. Since the dose is divided into three equal parts, each part will be 500 micrograms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To convert milligrams to micrograms, we simply divide by 100. So, each dose would be 5 micrograms. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A bladder washout is a medical procedure that involves flushing the bladder with a solution to remove blood clots, debris or other substances. The temperature of the solution should be carefully controlled to avoid causing discomfort or injury to the patient. In this case, the most appropriate answer is room temperature.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A cold bladder washout solution can help reduce inflammation and discomfort during the procedure, making it a preferred choice. However, if the patient has an infection or fever, a warm solution may be more effective in killing bacteria. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. If you are unable to remove the catheter, this means that there is something blocking its passage and it cannot be removed using standard techniques. In this case, the most appropriate answer is to call for assistance from a medical practitioner.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If a catheter remains blocked and cannot be removed, it's best to leave it in place and reassess the situation during the next scheduled catheter care. Trying harder or unblocking it could cause further complications. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Diplopia is double vision that can occur due to various reasons, including muscle weakness or paralysis of the eye muscles. If one eye is covered, it may cause diplopia in the uncovered eye as the brain tries to compensate for the missing input. The false image is the image that appears when both eyes are open and looking at the same object. A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards, causing a downward deviation of the affected eye. A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint, where the affected eye turns outward. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When the patient looks upwards, the superior rectus muscle is activated, which is innervated by the fourth cranial nerve. If this nerve is damaged, then the patient will have a diplopia when looking up. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is a stored form of glucose that can be broken down into glucose-6-phosphate, which enters glycolysis to produce ATP. During exercise, glycogen breakdown is activated by the hormone epinephrine (adrenaline), which stimulates the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase and increases the rate of glycogenolysis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. An increased pH, meaning a more alkaline environment, would favor enzyme activity and thus promote glycogen breakdown. However, this is not the case in exercising muscle, which becomes acidic due to lactic acid production. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is cortisol.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Skin excoriation is a common problem that can be caused by many factors, including poor fitting pouches and leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin. However, these are not the most likely causes. The use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin is unlikely to cause excoriation, as it does not irritate or dry out the skin. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A well-fitting pouch would rub against the skin constantly, causing friction and irritation, ultimately leading to excoriation. Changing the pouch every day or using unscented soap are unlikely causes of excoriation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is known to increase the extracellular pH and buffering capacity of the fluid surrounding the cells, which in turn allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle during exercise. This results in less acidosis and fatigue, leading to improved performance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. By reducing the pH, the extracellular fluid becomes more acidic, creating a larger concentration gradient that facilitates the efflux of hydrogen ions from the muscle. This results in an increase in the acidity of the muscle and a decrease in its ability to contract, leading to fatigue. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate ingestion should reduce the pH and buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid allowing a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the joints, leading to pain and stiffness. It is characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor in about 50% of cases, but not all patients with RA have it. Oligoarthritis refers to a condition where only a few joints are affected, while polyarthritis affects multiple joints. Anaemia is a common finding in RA due to chronic inflammation and increased demand for oxygen by the immune system. Heberden' nodes are bony enlargements at the base of the fingers or toes that can be seen on physical examination.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Rheumatoid arthritis is a degenerative joint disease, and Heberden's nodes are a common feature of such conditions, indicating joint damage and bone spurs. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term gene doping refers to the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance performance in sport. This is because it involves manipulating genes that are involved in muscle growth and development, which can lead to increased strength and endurance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gene doping would involve altering gene expression to mask the presence of performance-enhancing drugs in an athlete's system, making them undetectable in tests. This is not possible with current technology and therefore, option C is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The peak flow meter measures how fast a person can exhale air out of their lungs. This is usually done with an open mouth, so option A is incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Peak flow meters assess lung function by measuring the forced expiratory volume in one second, indicating how much air can be forcefully exhaled. This measurement is typically lower than the highest rate of air expelled from the lungs through an open mouth, which would indicate a higher level of effort required to breathe out.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It has four chambers, two atria and two ventricles, which are separated by valves to ensure proper blood flow. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The heart is a relatively simple pump with two chambers, one for receiving blood and one for pumping it out, and two valves to control the flow. This design allows for efficient circulation of blood throughout the body.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nociceptive pain is caused by actual or potential tissue damage and results in the release of chemical mediators that stimulate nerve fibres to initiate pain signals to the brain. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nociceptive pain arises from pressure or compression on a nerve or group of nerves, triggering pain signals that are sent to the brain. In contrast, neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the nervous system itself, which can result in abnormal pain signals being transmitted. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cannulas are medical devices used to deliver fluids or medications into the bloodstream, and they can become clogged with blood clots, debris, or other substances over time. Flushing a cannula helps prevent these blockages from occurring and ensures that the device is functioning properly. The frequency of flushing depends on several factors, including the type of medication being delivered, the patient's condition, and the length of time the cannula has been in place. In general, it is recommended to flush a cannula every 4-8 hours.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cannulas are prone to clogging, especially with medications, so frequent flushing every 16 hours is necessary to maintain patency. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is the storage form of glucose in the body, and it can be broken down into glucose when needed for energy production. Phosphocreatine breakdown also produces hydrogen ions as a byproduct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When pyruvate is converted to lactate, a hydrogen ion is released as part of the process, contributing to the acidity in the muscle. This indicates that glycolysis is being used as a major means of resynthesising ATP.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are a class of drugs that selectively bind to androgen receptors, which are present in various tissues such as muscle, bone, and prostate gland. They have been developed for the treatment of conditions such as osteoporosis, muscle wasting, and prostate cancer. The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs act on androgen receptors, but instead of mimicking androgens, they compete with them and block their effects, leading to reduced androgenic activity. This makes them a potential treatment for muscle wasting diseases such as cancer cachexia.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A pleural friction rub is a sound that occurs when two surfaces of the lung and chest wall rub together, usually due to inflammation or fluid buildup. It can be heard during inspiration and expiration, but it is more prominent in expiration. This suggests that the crackling sound is more likely due to a pleural friction rub than crackles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Clubbing is often seen in conditions with chronic hypoxia, which can also affect the pleura and lead to inflammation and friction rubs. However, this feature alone does not necessarily indicate a specific cause of the crackling sound. On the other hand, more prominent crackles during expiration suggest that the sound is coming from the pleural space itself, rather than the lung tissue. This suggests that the most likely cause is a pleural friction rub, which can be caused by conditions such as pneumonia or tuberculosis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration, and it involves a series of reactions that convert glucose into pyruvate. The rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is the one that catalyzes the slowest reaction in this pathway. In this case, the most appropriate answer is phosphofructokinase.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pyruvate dehydrogenase plays a crucial role in regulating the flow of metabolites through glycolysis, making it the rate-limiting enzyme. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gastric motility refers to the movement of food through the stomach, which is regulated by a complex interplay between various hormones and neurotransmitters. Drugs that enhance gastric motility are typically used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or delayed gastric emptying. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Ditropan.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine affects the nervous system, and its modulation of nerve signals can indirectly influence gastric motility, potentially enhancing it. In contrast, adrenaline is a hormone that increases heart rate and blood pressure, while ditropan is an anticholinergic drug used to treat overactive bladder. Erythromycin is an antibiotic with no known effect on gastric motility.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Blood clots are a serious issue that can lead to life-threatening complications, such as stroke or heart attack. If you notice that a patient has blood clots repeatedly blocking their catheter, it is crucial to inform the medical staff immediately so they can take appropriate action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has the right to know about any complications, so informing them about the blood clots should be the first step before taking further action. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine resynthesis is the process that replenishes ATP stores in muscle cells during recovery from exercise. This process requires an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients, as well as a balanced pH level. Excess creatine can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can impair this process. Hyperventilation can also cause acidosis, which interferes with the enzyme activity involved in phosphocreatine resynthesis. An excess of oxygen is beneficial for recovery, but not necessarily inhibiting. A lack of oxygen would actually be detrimental to recovery.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperventilation leads to excessive elimination of carbon dioxide, which can disrupt the acid-base balance and indirectly impair oxygen utilization, affecting phosphocreatine resynthesis. Therefore, hyperventilation is not a direct cause of inhibition. An excess of creatine or oxygen would actually enhance phosphocreatine resynthesis. A lack of oxygen could also inhibit phosphocreatine resynthesis but it's more likely that the lack of oxygen is due to insufficient blood flow rather than an intrinsic factor.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The arm should be at the same level as the heart to get an accurate reading of the blood pressure. If it is above, then gravity will cause a difference in the pressure between the upper and lower extremities, leading to an overestimation of the blood pressure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When the arm is above the heart level, gravity would cause blood to pool in the arm, leading to an overestimation of blood pressure. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A double stranded molecule of DNA is composed of two complementary strands, each consisting of a sequence of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G) or cytosine (C). The ratio of purines to pyrimidines is determined by the base sequence in RNA, which is complementary to DNA. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA can pair in different combinations, so the ratio can vary depending on the specific sequence of the DNA molecule. In RNA, however, the base sequence is determined by the DNA template, so the ratio is always 1:1.",D
