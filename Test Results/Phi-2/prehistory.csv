This suggests that human activity was a major factor in their extinction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Humans are known to have hunted megafauna extensively, and their arrival in Australia and America coincides with the extinction of these animals. Environmental changes could also play a role, but they would not be as significant as human hunting. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Indus Valley civilization is the furthest from being fully deciphered because their script, known as the Indus script, has not been fully decoded yet.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mesopotamian cuneiform is one of the oldest writing systems and despite significant progress, many texts remain undeciphered. Egyptian hieroglyphics are also complex but have been decoded to a large extent. Chinese characters are relatively simple compared to other ancient scripts, making them easier to decipher.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Yang-shao sites are located in the Yellow River valley of China, which is a region that has been historically known for its agriculture. The domesticated crops found at these sites include wheat, rice, and peas, all of which are staples in Chinese cuisine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Yang-shao culture was an early agricultural society, and beans and maize are staple crops often associated with early agricultural practices. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Ancestral Puebloans were a Native American culture that inhabited the Four Corners region of the United States, including parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona. They built elaborate cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde National Park, which was once home to over 5,000 people. However, around 1300 CE, many of these structures were abandoned, leaving behind only ruins. The reasons for this abandonment are still debated by archaeologists, but some possible factors include environmental degradation, population pressure, drought, warfare and social upheaval.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the population grew too large, the available resources in Mesa Verde wouldn't be sufficient to sustain the Ancestral Puebloans, forcing them to leave. Drought could have also played a role, but it's not clear if it was the primary cause of abandonment. A new religion attracting them to the south is unlikely since they had already established their culture and way of life in Mesa Verde before that time.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mayan city-states were NOT ruled by autonomous dynasties, as they all had a centralized political organization and a single ruler. They also did not have large agricultural hinterlands to support their population, as they relied on intensive farming techniques such as terracing and irrigation. Finally, they were much smaller in population than Mohanjo-daro, which was one of the largest cities in the Indus Valley Civilization.",A,"Let's reason step by step. City-states, by definition, require a substantial agricultural base to support their populations and economies. The Mayans were known for their advanced agricultural practices, including the use of chinampas (floating gardens) and terraced fields. Therefore, it is unlikely that they did not have large agricultural hinterlands.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lewis Henry Morgan was an American anthropologist who proposed a theory of cultural evolution that divided human societies into three stages based on their level of complexity and technology. The first stage is the savagery, where people live in small groups and rely on hunting and gathering for survival. The second stage is the barbarism, where people form larger communities and practice agriculture and animal husbandry. The third stage is the civilization, where people develop complex social structures, writing systems, and urbanization. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a three-age system.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Morgan's theory suggests that cultures evolve along multiple, independent paths, leading to diverse societal forms. This concept is known as multilineal evolution.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. The Upper Paleolithic was a period of significant cultural and technological advancements for humans, marked by the development of new stone-tool technologies, parietal and mobiliary art, acquisition of non-local raw materials, and changes in settlement patterns. However, which of these most strongly indicates advances in human intellect? While all of these developments are important, I believe that the acquisition of non-local raw materials is the strongest indicator of intellectual advancement because it required a level of planning, organization, and problem-solving skills that were not previously necessary for survival.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The development of more complex and organized settlement patterns during the Upper Paleolithic suggests advancements in human cognitive abilities. This is because it requires planning, cooperation, and communication among individuals to establish and maintain such settlements.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. The Middle Stone Age is a period that spans from about 300,000 years ago to around 10,000 BCE. During this time, humans were still primarily hunter-gatherers who relied on natural resources for survival. However, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest new uses for plants during this era. For example, the use of seeds as a natural insecticide in Altamira cave in southwestern Europe indicates that people were experimenting with different ways to protect their crops from pests. Additionally, plant materials such as flowers in Aurignacian burials in southern France suggest that plants may have had symbolic or ritualistic significance for these early humans. Finally, the use of wood in the Gravettian tradition to make spear-throwers and canoes indicates that people were beginning to develop more sophisticated tools and technologies using natural materials.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Middle Stone Age saw advancements in tool-making techniques and the use of diverse materials, including wood, which was used to create tools like spear-throwers and canoes for hunting and transportation.

",-,"Let's reason step by step. Sunda and Wallacea both sound Indonesian, and they're close together, so Sunda must be the landmass connecting Australia and New Guinea. Beringia is a landmass that connected Asia and North America during the last ice age.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The walls of Great Zimbabwe are a remarkable feat of engineering and architecture, with intricate designs and precise construction techniques that suggest they were built by skilled craftsmen. However, the prevailing view among archaeologists for many years was that these structures could not have been constructed by an indigenous sub-Saharan people because the technology required to build them did not exist at the time. This theory was based on a lack of written records or other evidence that would support such a claim. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of symbolic motifs suggests cultural influence, and Indian traders were known for their extensive trade networks, so they likely built the walls of Great Zimbabwe. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The word 'forward-thrusting' suggests that the lower face is protruding forward, which could be due to a variety of factors such as genetics or injury. However, we are looking for a specific term related to facial structure. The correct answer is 'prognathous', meaning having an abnormally large lower jaw.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mandible is the lower jaw, and a forward-thrusting lower face is a characteristic of the mandible, so the term must be ""mandible."".",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The domestication of animals is a complex process that involves many factors, such as the availability of food, water, shelter, and human interaction. One of the earliest evidence for animal domestication comes from the Asikli H\u00f6y\u00fck site in Central Turkey, where archaeologists have found remains of sheep, cattle, dogs, and chickens that date back to around 10,400 years ago.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cattle are crucial for agriculture and were likely among the first animals to be domesticated, so evidence for their domestication should be found at Asikli Höyük. Sheep and chickens were also important for early human societies but did not become as widely used in agriculture as cattle.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Hohokam were a Native American civilization that lived in the Sonoran Desert from about 200 to 1300 CE. They developed an advanced agricultural system based on irrigation and terracing, which allowed them to grow crops such as maize, beans, squash, and cotton. They also built extensive networks of canals, reservoirs, and dams to manage their water supply. One of the most distinctive features of Hohokam culture was their ritual consumption of maize beer, which they brewed from fermented corn. This practice is similar to that of Mesoamerican cultures such as the Maya and the Aztec, who also used maize as a staple food and a sacred offering. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Stepped pyramids are iconic Mesoamerican structures, and the Hohokam were influenced by Mesoamerican culture, so they probably borrowed the practice of building pyramids. The most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Inca civilization was able to thrive in the Andes Mountains, which are known for their steep slopes and rocky terrain. To make use of this land, they developed a technique called terracing, which involved cutting steps into the mountainside to create flat areas for farming. This allowed them to grow crops on otherwise unusable land.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fertilizing enriches the soil and helps plants grow better, so it would have allowed the Inca to cultivate more land. However, this is not enough to explain why they were able to increase their arable land significantly. The other options do not make sense in this context. For example, irrigating or terracing could help with water management, but they wouldn't necessarily lead to increased yields. Slashing and burning would have destroyed the soil and made it unsuitable for farming. Therefore, the most likely answer is that the Inca used a combination of these techniques to maximize their agricultural output.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The hypothesis suggests that tool making required a certain level of cognitive ability, which could only be achieved through language. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Tool making often involves collaboration, which requires communication, so language must have evolved before tool making to facilitate cooperation. Additionally, tool making is a complex cognitive task that likely required specialized brain regions and connections. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Teotihuac\u00e1n came to prominence in the Basin of Mexico after its rival, Cuicuilco,",A,"Let's reason step by step. Powerful cities often face internal struggles for power, so Cuicuilco likely succumbed to a civil war, allowing Teotihuacán to rise. In addition, volcanic eruptions can cause widespread destruction and loss of life, which would have crippled Cuicuilco. A blight on crops could also be devastating, but it is unlikely that this was the primary reason for Cuicuilco's downfall. Finally, while hurricanes can certainly cause damage, they are not likely to have been a significant factor in the rise and fall of these two cities.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Olmec culture was one of the earliest Mesoamerican civilizations, and it is believed to have been founded around 1200 BCE. One of the most significant aspects of this culture was its religious iconography, which included elaborate sculptures and carvings depicting gods and other supernatural beings. Additionally, the Olmecs were known for their large armies, which they used to expand their territory and exert control over neighboring regions. Finally, the Olmecs also had a sophisticated agricultural system that allowed them to produce surplus crops, which in turn supported their growing population. Therefore, all of these factors played a role in unifying the Olmec culture.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Strong armies, abundant food, and shared religious beliefs are all important for unifying a culture, so they likely all played a role in the Olmec civilization. However, the most significant factor was probably their agricultural surpluses, which allowed them to support large populations and build impressive structures.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Upper Egypt is the northern part of Egypt, while Lower Egypt is located in the south.",A,"Let's reason step by step. On a map, north is usually at the top, so Upper Egypt must be north of Lower Egypt. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The Qin Dynasty was known for its grandiose architecture and monumental structures. An enormous pyramid constructed out of millions of huge limestone blocks is the most appropriate answer.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Pyramids are monumental structures built as tombs for powerful rulers, so Emperor Ying Zheng's memorial was likely a massive pyramid. The correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for a subfield of anthropology that studies human remains and artifacts from past cultures, which is archaeology.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Linguistics is the study of languages, and languages are often preserved through written records or oral traditions, which can be considered as ""garbage"" from the past. Archaeology is the study of human history and prehistory through the excavation of artifacts, but it does not necessarily focus on studying other people's garbage. Paleoanthropology is the study of human evolution and prehistoric humans, but it also focuses on fossils rather than written records or oral traditions. Primatology is the study of primates, which includes humans, but it does not necessarily involve studying ""garbage"" from the past.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. The earliest evidence of cattle domestication comes from archaeological sites in the Fertile Crescent region of western Asia, which includes modern-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey. This suggests that cattle were first domesticated there around 10,500 years ago.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Western Europe has a long history of agriculture and animal husbandry, so it's reasonable to assume that cattle domestication originated there. However, the earliest evidence for this comes from sub-Saharan Africa, where some researchers have found remains of domesticated cattle dating back to about 8,500 years ago.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Ancestral Puebloan, Hohokam, and Mississippian cultures all had complex societies with advanced agricultural practices and ceremonial activities.

However, this period also coincided with two major events that would eventually lead to the decline of the civilization: the invasion of the Mycenaeans, who were a powerful and aggressive group from mainland Greece, and the eruption of Thera, which was a nearby island that produced massive lava flows and ash clouds. These events caused widespread destruction, displacement, and social unrest among the Minoans, and marked the beginning of their downfall.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Minoan civilization flourished during the Bronze Age, and its decline likely coincided with the rise of the Mycenaeans and the transition to the Iron Age. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an earthquake and a volcanic eruption.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mesopotamia is located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which are two of the most important rivers in human history. The Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet at a delta region called the Fertile Crescent, where agriculture flourished for thousands of years.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mesopotamia is known as the cradle of civilization and is situated in a fertile region between two major rivers, like the Nile and Amazon. However, these rivers are not located in this area. The most appropriate answer is Euphrates and Nile.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. Homo habilis emerged around 4.5 million years ago and Homo erectus followed at around 3.2 million years ago.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The evolution of hominids progressed gradually, with Homo habilis appearing around 3.6 million years ago and Homo erectus following around 2.8 million years ago. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hand axe technology was one of the earliest known technologies used by humans, and it is believed to have evolved over time as our ancestors developed new techniques for shaping stone. The most appropriate answer is that hand axe technology steadily improved between 1.4 million and 400,000 years ago.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If hand axe technology remained largely unchanged for such a long period, it suggests a deterioration in the ability to create more advanced tools. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first two choices are reasonable hypotheses, but the last two are not. It is true that walking on two legs freed up the hands for carrying things and allowed for braincase expansion, but it does not explain why hominids walked on two legs in the first place. One possible explanation is that bipedalism was an adaptation to a changing environment, such as grasslands or savannas, where running on all fours would have been less efficient than walking on two legs. Another possibility is that bipedalism evolved as a result of social factors, such as the need for communication and cooperation among group members.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main advantage of walking on two legs is that it frees up the hands, allowing hominids to carry tools and food more efficiently. Braincase expansion was also a significant evolutionary change in hominids, but this would have been an indirect consequence of bipedalism rather than its primary purpose.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for the year in which dairying became an important part of subsistence in Europe. We know that the lactase persistence mutation allowed humans to digest milk into adulthood, so it must have been present before this time. Additionally, we know that domesticated cattle were used for their milk and meat, so they would have been around by at least 5500 years ago. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The development of dairying in Europe was likely driven by the domestication of cattle around 5,500 years ago, providing a reliable source of milk. This allowed for the production of cheese and yogurt, which provided an adaptive advantage due to their long shelf life and high nutritional value.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Trace element analysis is a technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials. It can be applied to artifacts, ecofacts, and features to gain insights into their origin, use, and context.",D,"Let's reason step by step. By analyzing the trace elements present in an artifact, we can understand its relationship to other objects and features within the archaeological context. This information is crucial for understanding how artifacts were used and their significance within a particular culture or time period.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Mousterian culture is known for its production of simple, functional stone tools such as scrapers and choppers. In contrast, the Aurignacian culture produced more complex tools such as hand axes and blades with a larger usable surface area.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mousterian tools, associated with Neanderthals, were more advanced than Aurignacian tools, featuring larger and more efficient blade surfaces. In contrast, Aurignacian technology was focused on the production of hand axes.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. All of these options are evidence of complex societies, but only one is the most specific. Monumental works, burials with grave goods and leisure and a sedentary lifestyle all indicate that people had specialized roles in society and were able to produce and consume goods beyond their immediate needs. However, the presence of monumental works suggests that there was also a hierarchy and social stratification within these societies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of elaborate burials with valuable grave goods signifies a complex society with established hierarchies and rituals. Additionally, monumental works such as pyramids or temples indicate advanced engineering skills and resources. Finally, leisure activities and a sedentary lifestyle suggest that people had the time and resources to engage in non-essential pursuits.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Humans have been farming for thousands of years, but it wasn't until around 12,000 years ago that they began to actively control their food sources by artificially producing conditions under which these sources would grow.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Evidence suggests that human groups began actively cultivating crops and managing food sources around 18,000 years ago, marking the transition to agriculture. This is supported by archaeological findings of early farming tools and domesticated plants.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Ancestral Puebloan culture flourished in the southwestern United States from about 200 BCE to 1300 CE. This period is known as the Anasazi era and is characterized by the construction of elaborate cliff dwellings, pottery, and other artifacts. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A. 5,000 years ago.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Ancestral Puebloan culture reached its peak around 2,000 years ago, similar to the timeframe of other early civilizations like the Maya and Egyptians. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the florescence of this culture occurred during this period.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The key change in hominids beginning at least as early as Homo erectus that is probably related to increasingly larger brain size is the development of a supraorbital cortex, which is an area of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions such as problem-solving and decision making.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The expansion of the supraorbital cortex in hominids like Homo erectus is a key change related to larger brain size and enhanced cognitive abilities. This is because this region of the brain is responsible for processing visual information, which is crucial for survival and adaptation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Indus Valley Civilization was one of the earliest urban civilizations in the world, with cities like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa being carefully planned and designed. They also had a standardized system of weights and measures, which suggests that they had a highly centralized economy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of standardized weights and measures suggests a sophisticated economic system with established trade networks and administrative control. Carefully planned and designed cities indicate advanced urban planning skills, while highly centralized economies suggest strong political control over the region. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Minoan economy was based on agriculture, maritime trade and metalworking. Agriculture was the main source of food for the population, while maritime trade brought in valuable resources from other regions. Metalworking was a key industry that produced high-quality goods such as pottery, jewelry and weapons. Slave labor was also used to supplement the workforce, but it was not essential for the economy. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Minoan civilization's reliance on metalworking, particularly bronze production, made them susceptible to disruptions in trade routes and resource availability. Additionally, their agricultural practices were heavily dependent on the Mediterranean climate, which could be affected by natural disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Hopewell people were a Native American culture that lived in the Midwest region of North America from about 200 BCE to 500 CE. They had a complex subsistence strategy that involved agriculture, hunting, fishing, and gathering. Among their crops, maize was one of the most important sources of food, as it provided carbohydrates, protein, and vitamins. Sunflower, squash, and knotweed were also cultivated by the Hopewell, but they were not as essential or widespread as maize. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Hopewell people relied on a diverse range of crops for subsistence, including sunflower, which provided seeds for food and oil. Squash was also an important crop, providing both food and storage. Maize was another key component of their diet, as it could be ground into flour or made into cornmeal. Knotweed, however, was not commonly used by the Hopewell people.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for which group of people contributed to the modern European genome. We know that the earliest anatomically modern Homo sapiens lived in Europe about 45,000 years ago and that people genetically traceable to the Middle East moved into Europe about 9,000 years ago. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and B. The question also states that people who moved there from west Asia less than 5,000 years ago, so option C is incorrect as well. This leaves us with option D, which includes all of the above groups.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The modern European genome is primarily shaped by migrations from West Asia that occurred less than 5,000 years ago, introducing new genetic diversity to the region. However, it also includes contributions from earlier anatomically modern Homo sapiens who lived in Europe about 45,000 years ago and people genetically traceable to the Middle East who moved into Europe about 9,000 years ago.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The levels of 13C can be used to determine the proportion of carbon from different sources that an individual consumed.

The most plausible answer is supported by genetic evidence that establishes close connections between the oldest skeletons in the Americas and the European genome.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The evidence of Norse settlements in North America around A.D. 1000 proves that Europeans were the first to colonize the continent at the end of the Pleistocene. This is supported by genetic evidence from the oldest skeletons in the Americas, which establishes close connections between modern Native Americans and the native people of central Siberia.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Moche civilization was known for its elaborate burial practices, which included the construction of large tombs and the placement of valuable objects inside them. It is unlikely that thieves would have been caught while raiding these tombs, as they were well-guarded and hidden from view. A forest fire may have destroyed some evidence of the cemetery, but it is also possible that the Moche people intentionally cleared away vegetation to make room for their burials. An exact replica of the city in a map room would be highly unlikely, as such maps did not exist at the time. Finally, sheep falling into a tomb is an interesting possibility, but there is no evidence to support this theory.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The greatest Egyptian pyramids at Giza were built as burial monuments for the pharaoh Khufu, Khufu's son Khafre, and Khufu's grandson Menkaure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 6th dynasty of Egypt was renowned for its extensive construction projects, making it the most likely period for the construction of the Giza pyramids. However, the book of Exodus suggests that slaves were coerced and worked under the threat of death during this time, which is not supported by historical evidence. Therefore, option B can be eliminated. Option A is a popular belief but has been disproven by archaeological findings. The correct answer must be C or D. Since there are multiple reasons for the construction of the pyramids in the 6th dynasty, we cannot definitively say that it was the greatest Egyptian pyramid builders. However, the most likely reason is option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Neoteny is the retention of juvenile characteristics into adulthood, which would have made Homo erectus less capable of migrating long distances and adapting to new environments.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Neoteny, with its characteristic features like longer limbs and a lighter build, likely provided Homo erectus with greater agility and endurance for long-distance travel. Intelligence may have also played a role in their ability to navigate unfamiliar terrain, but it is not as directly linked to migration as neoteny. Bipedalism was certainly an important adaptation that allowed them to cover more ground on two legs, but it alone would not have been enough to explain their rapid and extensive migrations. Microcephaly, or a smaller than average head size, is associated with developmental disorders and does not seem to be relevant in this context.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. The half-life of a radioactive isotope is the time it takes for half of the atoms in a sample to decay into another element. By measuring the ratio of parent to daughter isotopes, we can calculate how long ago the rock formed or was last heated. In this case, the most appropriate answer is argon/argon and potassium argon dating.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Luminescence dating techniques, such as optically stimulated luminescence, rely on the principle of radioactive decay and are used to determine the age of rocks. This method is based on the fact that certain minerals in rocks accumulate energy from ionizing radiation over time. When these minerals are exposed to light or heat, they release this stored energy in the form of light. The amount of light emitted can be measured and used to calculate the age of the rock.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle and upper paleolithic are two distinct periods within the Paleolithic era, characterized by different cultural and technological developments. One of the most important differences between them is the use of stone tools. In the lower paleolithic, stone hand axes were the primary tool used for hunting and butchering animals. However, in the middle and upper paleolithic, there was a profusion of stone tool traditions, indicating a change from temporal and geographic homogeneity to greater diversity and variability.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Some possible causes for this collapse include environmental factors such as drought, deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity; social factors such as political instability, warfare, slavery, and human sacrifice; and cultural factors such as religious changes, linguistic shifts, and demographic decline. Based on the available evidence, the most plausible explanation is a combination of ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn farming techniques and environmental stressors that weakened the Maya's resilience and adaptability.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sudden disappearance of the Maya civilization suggests a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster or a large-scale epidemic, that decimated their population and infrastructure. This is supported by archaeological evidence of widespread destruction and abandonment of cities. On the other hand, ecological degradation resulting from slash-and-burn farming techniques would have taken much longer to cause such a dramatic collapse.

While it's true that the Neandertals had a different toolkit than modern humans, this alone would not have been enough to cause their demise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Neandertals' demise can be attributed to their inability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment, as they were highly specialized to the cold, glacial conditions of the Pleistocene epoch. Their tool technology was also less advanced than that of Homo sapiens, which may have limited their ability to survive in new environments.
