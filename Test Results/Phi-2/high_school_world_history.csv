D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Portugal and Spain, two European powers that were competing for control over newly discovered lands. The treaty divided the world into two parts, with Portugal gaining control of all lands to the east of a line drawn from pole to pole on the ocean sea, while Spain gained control of all lands to the west of the same line. This division was based on the belief that the route to the New World was easier traveled by going east, and that the Portuguese had already discovered a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope in the south of Africa. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese were known for their pursuit of wealth and resources, and the lands of Mexico, with their abundant gold and silver, would have been a highly desirable territory for them to control. Additionally, the Portuguese had already established trade routes in Asia and Africa, so it is possible that they believed they could find new trade opportunities by exploring the eastern side of the demarcation line.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage is written in the form of an argumentative essay, which presents two opposing views on the issue of sati and supports one of them with evidence and logic. The second passage is a response to the first one, where the author agrees with the main point but adds some additional information and context. Based on this, we can infer that the British motivations for eradicating sati were not primarily religious or moral, but rather pragmatic and strategic. They wanted to maintain their control over India by appeasing the local population and preventing any potential rebellions or uprisings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The British were predominantly Christian and often sought to spread their religion in their colonies, so their opposition to the sati ritual likely stemmed from a desire to convert the Indian population to Christianity.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The caste system in India has been traditionally attributed to the Purusa-Sukta, which describes how the gods divided Purusa into four divisions of human society based on their physical attributes. However, this interpretation is not supported by historical evidence or contemporary scholarship, as it ignores the diversity and complexity of Indian social and economic life before and after the Vedic period. Therefore, the best answer that would contradict the argument that the caste system imposed rigid roles on Indian society is C, because it suggests that the Mahabarata was composed by a non-Vedic author who challenged the Brahmanical authority and ideology of the Purusa-Sukta.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

This movement gained momentum after World War I, when India's contribution to the war effort was recognized by the British government. However, it was not until the Great Depression that the boycott became more widespread and effective, as people faced economic hardships and sought alternative sources of income. The Soviet Union also played a role in supporting the nationalist cause, especially after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, which divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between the two powers.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is about Simón Bolívar, a Venezuelan military and political leader who played a key role in the independence movements of several Latin American countries from Spain. He was born to an Afro-Venezuelan mother and a Spanish father, making him one of the first mixed-race leaders in history. He fought against the Spanish colonial rule and helped establish the Gran Colombia, which included present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and parts of Peru and Bolivia. He also led several other rebellions and wars to liberate other Latin American nations from Spain. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The first union of independent Latin American states.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta was a famous explorer and traveler who visited many parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in the 14th century. He wrote about his experiences in his book ""The Travels of Ibn Battuta"", which is considered one of the most comprehensive and detailed accounts of the Islamic world at that time. Zheng He was another famous Chinese explorer and admiral who led several expeditions to Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and East Africa in the early 15th century. Marco Polo was a Venetian merchant and traveler who visited China, Persia, India, and other regions in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Lorenzo de Medici was an Italian nobleman and patron of arts and sciences who lived in Florence in the 15th century. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk and scholar who traveled to India in the 7th century to study Buddhism and bring back scriptures. Based on these facts, we can conclude that Ibn Battuta's experiences were most similar to those of Marco Polo.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. Marco Polo was also a famous traveler, but his travels took place in the 13th century, which is significantly earlier than Ibn Battuta's time. Lorenzo de Medici was an Italian nobleman and patron of the arts who lived during the Renaissance period, which is much later than Ibn Battuta's era. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India in the 7th century, which is also much earlier than Ibn Battuta's travels.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The author states that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment, which implies that they actively extended their exploitation from inside Europe to cover the whole of Africa. This is supported by the fact that the slave trade was aggressively expanded to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations and slaves were continuously sold into the Mediterranean market by Arabian merchants. The establishment of Cape Colony by the Dutch East India Company also supports this assertion, as it further facilitated European exploitation of African resources. However, there is no evidence to suggest that trade links between Europe and Ethiopia contributed to African underdevelopment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. Additionally, the Dutch East India Company's establishment in Cape Colony was not directly related to underdevelopment but rather colonization and exploitation. The growth of trade links between Europe and Ethiopia is also irrelevant as it does not address the issue at hand. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is best understood in the context of which of the following political movements? It talks about a people who are fighting against slavery and oppression, but also mentions that they have been ruled more by deceit than by force.

It could also be argued that Lenin and Stalin vastly improved Russian military preparedness. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The dramatic rise in literacy rates suggests that the Soviet Union's communist system was more effective in achieving its goals compared to other communist nations like China. This is because the Soviet Union had a centralized government and invested heavily in education, which allowed it to achieve higher literacy rates than China.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The letter written by Lord Ii is a clear indication that Japan was facing significant challenges from foreign powers, particularly the United States. In response, the government took several steps to modernize and strengthen the country's military and economy.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's concept of the socialist transformation of agriculture in China is based on the idea that all aspects of rural life should be organized and managed collectively, rather than through individual ownership or profit-seeking behavior. This means that land would no longer be owned privately, but instead would be held in common by the community as a whole. Additionally, agricultural production would be centralized and planned at the state level, with resources allocated based on need rather than market demand. The goal of this approach is to create a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources across the entire population, while also promoting greater efficiency and productivity in agriculture. This is consistent with Mao's broader vision for socialist transformation in China, which emphasizes the importance of collective action and cooperation as a means of achieving social and economic progress.""

Option A might seem like a reasonable choice, but it is not supported by the data, as literacy rates did not increase significantly among the rural peasantry during this period. Therefore, the most likely answer is option C, which refers to the urban middle class.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The first paragraph mentions that the Portuguese bring silver from Japan and India to China, while they import goods such as gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, etc. from China to Japan. This trade pattern is disrupted when the Portuguese are forced to remain in Canton for certain days and put their names in a book before entering or leaving the city.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking us to identify a possible cause for Nicholas II's abdication, which was a major event in Russian history. We can eliminate options A and D because they do not relate directly to the political situation at the time. Option B is also unlikely because it does not explain why Nicholas would give up his power voluntarily. The most plausible explanation is option C, which suggests that Nicholas' abdication was due to military losses and resentment of the working classes. This is supported by the fact that Nicholas had been trying to appease these groups in order to maintain stability, but ultimately he realized that it was not enough. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nicholas II mentions the 'happiness of the people,' suggesting that economic prosperity and dissatisfaction with the aristocracy led to his abdication. He also mentions 'the risk losing everything tomorrow, in fact, the risk losing everything.' This implies widespread resentment of the working classes. The other options are not mentioned in the sources.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first source mentions that the Republic of Colombia was established with a fundamental law, which implies that it had some form of government and laws in place before its establishment. This suggests that religion played an important role in the formation of the republic.\nThe second source mentions that Brazil was a monarchy with a hereditary dynasty, but also allowed for religious toleration. This indicates that while religion may have been important to the ruling class, it did not necessarily dictate the beliefs and practices of all citizens.\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that while religion played an important role in the formation of both republics, it was not a dominant force in their societies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Brazilian constitution mentions a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion as the religion of the Empire, suggesting a connection between religious authority and the divine right of monarchs. In addition, the text also states that followers of all other religions are allowed to worship within their households or particular houses for that intent, which implies some level of religious toleration. Therefore, it can be inferred that religious tolerance gained acceptance with the laws of most states in the period.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poet is discussing the history of Latin America and its cultural significance, particularly in regards to poetry. This suggests that the purpose of the poem was to highlight the importance of Latin American literature.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Additionally, the reference to Columbus's name coming from Plato indicates that Latin America had made significant contributions to science and exploration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase ""his Indians"" in the quote refers to a Spanish nobleman who had control over Native Americans and required them to provide him with goods from their land. This practice was known as encomienda, which involved granting land and labor to individuals for religious or military service. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The nobleman likely had indigenous people working for him as apprentices, learning agricultural techniques in exchange for food and shelter. This is the most appropriate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage states that Muslims were more peaceful than Christians, which is not necessarily true. The second passage suggests that most Muslims were interested in protecting their own territory, but this does not imply that they were inherently violent. The third passage implies that many Muslims during the crusading era were driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent, which is also not necessarily true. The fourth passage states that the ideology of holy war was taken seriously by Muslim elites during the crusading era, which is supported by the first and second passages. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the duty of jihad and the goal of bringing the world under Islamic sway, indicating that many Muslims during the Crusades were inherently violent and driven by their faith to conquer others. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The instructions indicated in the fourth paragraph to remain nonviolent most likely inspired which of the following historical developments?\nI think the answer is B, because the independence movements that freed the states of southeast Asia from colonial rule were often led by leaders who advocated for nonviolence and civil disobedience as a means of achieving their goals. For example, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the main inspirations for these movements, and he used similar methods to challenge British imperialism in India. Therefore, I believe that the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance likely inspired the Zionist movement, as they both employed civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve their goals. The independence movements in southeast Asia were also nonviolent, but they had different causes and outcomes than the Zionist movement. The civil rights movements in the United States were violent and confrontational, unlike Gandhi'a approach. The communist movement that changed the government of Cuba was a radical and militant force that opposed the US intervention in the Cuban Revolution.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The New Kingdom was a period in ancient Egypt when it expanded its territory through military campaigns, especially against Nubia and Libya. It also faced challenges from the Hittites, who were rivals for control of Syria and the Levant. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions a champion of Syria, which suggests a conflict with the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem is a reflection of the poet's admiration for Spanish America and his belief that it is the daughter of the sun, a powerful and vibrant nation. He also expresses his fear of being captured by the U.S., which he sees as a formidable enemy. The events that might have prompted him to compose this piece are those that involved U.S. intervention or influence in Spanish America, such as the discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram (A), the embargo of Cuba after Castro\u2019s revolution (B), U.S. involvement in Panama\u2019s independence (C) and U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution (D). The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's themes of resistance against a powerful invader and the mention of 'barbarous soul' suggest it was written in response to the Haitian Revolution and the fight against French colonialism.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter describes a situation where the author is suing the government for damages done by natives who have recently encamped near his homestead and caused damage to his property. This suggests that the British government has failed in its responsibility to protect citizens living in South Africa, as they are unable to prevent such incidents from occurring.

The passage focuses on the impressive walls and ramparts of Uruk, suggesting that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications and were vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, the mention of a temple dedicated to Ishtar implies that ancient cities featured areas for worshipping their patron deities.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator of the song would most likely identify as a Protestant, given that Protestants were persecuted during this time period and the narrator is asking for forgiveness from Ferdinand, who was a Catholic king. In addition, the use of ""poor Winter King"" suggests that the narrator is not referring to Ferdinand's son, but rather his father.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The song criticizes the 'Winter King' for snatching the crown and emphasizes the legitimacy of Ferdinand as the rightful king, suggesting a conflict between Muslims and Christians during this period.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the British rule in India was an autocracy, which means a system of government where one person or a small group has absolute power and authority over others. The passage also states that the revolt of 1857 shattered the monopoly of violence that the British had constructed over the Indians, who were treated as inferior and uncivilized by the rulers. This implies that the violence was not only directed against the official enemies of the British, but also against the common people who suffered from poverty, oppression, and exploitation under the colonial rule. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B) Killing of civilians during wartime.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe violence and massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, suggesting that banditry due to socio-economic breakdown was a significant issue in colonial India. However, this is not the most appropriate answer as it does not specifically mention the role of British rule or the use of violence against indigenous people.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mansa Musa's assertion about the lack of duties levied on goods in his kingdom most strongly reflects which of the following about the kingdom of Mali?\nMali was a wealthy and powerful empire that controlled much of West Africa, especially the gold-rich regions of the Niger River basin. It had a strong central authority that collected taxes from its subjects and traded with other kingdoms and empires. However, it also relied heavily on the slave trade, which brought in millions of captives from neighboring regions and sold them to European traders for profit. Therefore, Mansa Musa's statement about the absence of duties on copper is not surprising, as he was probably referring to a commodity that was widely used for trade and had no intrinsic value or cultural significance. The other options are more likely to be true, but they do not explain why Mansa Musa would make such a claim.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Mansa Musa's control over 'pagan nations' and the slave trade, suggesting that Mali's wealth primarily came from the exploitation of the slave trade. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade was a brutal and inhumane practice that involved capturing, transporting, and selling millions of Africans as slaves across the world. It was driven by various factors such as economic interests, political power, religious beliefs, racial prejudices, and cultural norms.

The other options are either irrelevant or contradictory to the passage.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the capture of a large number of women, indicating that the Arab slave trade was primarily driven by the demand for female slaves for domestic and reproductive purposes.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Sovereign Congress of Venezuela, to which authority the people of the Republic of the New Granada have voluntarily stood by, is a clear indication that the people were seeking more power and prosperity in their newly formed republic. This was also true for the provinces of Venezuela and the New Granada, who united under the title of Republic of Colombia. The Fundamental Law Establishing Gran Colombia, passed by the Congress of Angostura convened by Simon Bolivar, further solidified this union. Therefore, it can be concluded that nationalist movements advocating pan-Americanism were most directly responsible for creating these constitutions.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The only option left is C, which refers to the development and application of steam-powered technologies. While these technologies certainly had an impact on European expansion, they were not a major factor compared to other developments such as gunpowder or joint-stock companies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gunpowder technology was primarily a medieval advancement, so it wouldn't have significantly contributed to European hegemony between 1450 and 1750. Steam-powered technologies were developed in the 18th century, which is much later than the time period we are discussing. The exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe would have been beneficial for both regions but wouldn't necessarily contribute to one region's global hegemony. Joint-stock companies were not implemented until the 16th century, so they couldn' t have contributed to European hegemony before that.",A

D,"Let's reason step by step. The song is about the events that led to the Peace of Augsburg, which was a treaty signed in 1555 between the Holy Roman Empire and the German princes. It ended the religious wars that had been raging for decades and established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio (whose realm, his religion). The song expresses the feelings of the Winter King, who is a fictional character based on Ferdinand II, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was also known as ""Ferdinand I"" in Bohemia. He was opposed to the Peace of Augsburg and wanted to restore Catholicism as the dominant religion in Germany. However, he was defeated by his rival, Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was supported by the Protestant princes. The song is a satire that mocks the Winter King's pride and arrogance, and celebrates the victory of peace and tolerance.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is about Mao Zedong's views on agricultural co-operation, which he believed was necessary to bring about a socialist transformation of the countryside. He argued that this would eliminate the rich-peasant economy and individual economy in the countryside, and make all rural people increasingly well off together. This would consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The passage also mentions some later developments that might undermine these hopes. One of them is the development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast, which brought economic growth to China. Another one is the political friction with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, which pushed China into the orbit of the United States. A third one is the cooperatives of peasants on the farmland and an emphasis on countryside steel production, which brought famine and poverty to the Chinese peasantry. A fourth one is the opposition voices in the Communist Party led by men such as Deng Xiaopeng, who were rooted out and silenced during the Cultural Revolution. Out of these four options, only the first one seems to be consistent with Mao's views on agricultural co-operation, which was aimed at promoting economic growth and development in the countryside. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. However, this is not mentioned in the passage and therefore cannot be the answer. The development of Special Economic Zones along the Chinese coast brought economic growth to China.
