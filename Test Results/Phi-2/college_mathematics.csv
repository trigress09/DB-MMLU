Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in any factorial, there cannot be any factorial ending in exactly 99 zeros. Therefore, the answer must be either one or four.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of getting a six on one toss is 1/6, so the probability of not getting a six on one toss is 5/6. Therefore, the probability of not getting a six on 360 tosses is (5/6)^360 ≈ 0.0008.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected number of sixes in 360 tosses is 60, and the standard deviation is about 7.75. Therefore, the probability of getting 70 or more sixes should be greater than 0.50, since it is more than one standard deviation away from the mean. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
