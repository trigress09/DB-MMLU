C,"Let's reason step by step. Global GDP is the total value of goods and services produced in a country or region over a specific period, usually one year. Public spending on education refers to the amount of money that governments allocate for educational purposes, such as schools, teachers, books, etc. As of 2017, global GDP was about $87 trillion, according to the World Bank. If we assume that public spending on education is evenly distributed among all countries and regions, then the average share would be 87/7 = 12.4%. However, this is an unrealistic scenario, as some countries and regions have much higher or lower levels of economic development, population size, and political stability than others. Therefore, a more accurate estimate would depend on various factors, such as income per capita, literacy rate, enrollment ratio, etc. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, public spending on education in the world was about 4% of global GDP in 2017. This means that out of every $100 spent by governments worldwide, only $4 went towards education. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, all of these hindrances are likely to have contributed to the economic development challenges faced by many post-colonial countries.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In the given question, we are asked to find out how many Americans thought that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake in the year 1995. The answer is not provided in the question, so we have to make an educated guess based on our knowledge of history and current events. Based on this, it seems likely that most Americans would have opposed sending troops to Vietnam at that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Vietnam War was a highly controversial conflict, and there was significant public dissent and opposition to U.S. involvement. In 1965, the percentage of Americans who thought that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake was 65%. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The percentage of people with access to electricity is increasing every year, but it's not clear how much the increase is. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 80%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While electrification efforts have made progress, there are still many remote areas and underserved communities without reliable access to electricity. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), as of 2017, only about 60% of the world's population had some access to electricity.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the difference between males and females in terms of mental health disorders. We know that both depression and alcohol use disorder are common mental health problems, but they affect different genders differently. According to a study published in 2020, males are more likely than females to have depression while females are more likely than males to have an alcohol use disorder.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Men often face societal pressures and expectations that can contribute to higher rates of depression and alcohol use disorders. Additionally, men may be less likely to seek help for these issues due to stigma or lack of access to resources.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2016, about 13% of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight. This percentage is higher than the global average and indicates a growing health concern.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With the rise in obesity rates and the abundance of calorie-dense foods, it's likely that a significant portion of the population is overweight. However, we need to look at the data to be sure. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of 2016, about 40% of adults aged 18 years or older were overweight.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. CO2 emissions per capita are a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by each person in a country. This is an important indicator of a country's contribution to global warming and climate change. In 2017, Russia emitted the most CO2 per capita among all countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Iran is a major oil-producing country with significant industrial activities, which often contribute to high levels of CO2 emissions. Canada and Russia are also large countries with high per capita emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels for energy production. Japan has made efforts to reduce its carbon footprint through the use of renewable energy sources. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Iran.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The United States, China and India are the top three countries that emit CO2 in the world. However, we need to consider the total amount of emissions per capita as well. According to the World Bank data, Canada has the highest per capita emission rate among these four countries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Canada has a large landmass and significant resource extraction industries, which can contribute to substantial CO2 emissions. Russia is the world's largest country in terms of area, but its population density is relatively low, so it may not have as high of an overall carbon footprint. Iran is located in the Middle East, where oil production is a major industry, while Japan has a highly developed economy and a large population, which can contribute to significant CO2 emissions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole and not any specific country. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that some countries have had relatively significant growth rates.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces numerous challenges, including poverty, conflict, and limited infrastructure, which can hinder economic development across the region. However, some countries have managed to achieve significant growth rates in recent years. In this case, the most appropriate answer is that some countries have had relatively significant growth rates, but the Democratic Republic of Congo has become poorer than it initially was in 1980.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of survey respondents from India who reported having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services. We can eliminate options A and B because they are too low. Option C seems plausible, but it's still not certain. However, option D is clearly much higher than any reasonable estimate, so we can conclude that this answer is incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While corruption exists in many societies, it's unlikely that a majority of people would openly admit to paying bribes. However, the percentage of survey respondents who reported having paid a bribe is still high enough to indicate that there is a problem with public services in India. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B (49%).",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS is a viral infection that attacks the immune system, specifically targeting CD4+ T cells. As of 2020, an estimated 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide, and 1.5 million new infections occurred each year. The most appropriate answer is 14 million.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With improved access to antiretroviral therapy and increased awareness of HIV/AIDS, the number of people living with the virus has likely decreased significantly. In 2020, an estimated 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global literacy rate is the percentage of people aged 15 and over who can read and write with understanding a short simple statement on their everyday life. In 1950, the global literacy rate was only 36%. This number increased significantly in the following decades, reaching 76% in 1990 and 96% in 2015.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the progress made in education and literacy initiatives over time, it's reasonable to assume that a majority of the global population was literate in 1950. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 56%.",B
