Rabies is a viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals, and while it can be prevented with vaccination, it's not typically associated with international travel. Therefore, the most successful and widely used 'travel' vaccine for international visitors is yellow fever.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the serious risks associated with yellow fever in many parts of the world, it's undoubtedly the most crucial 'travel' vaccine for international visitors. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The annual incidence of hepatitis C infection in IV drug users is the number of new cases per year divided by the total population at risk. In this case, we know that 100 out of 10,000 IV drug users acquire hepatitis C during follow-up. Therefore, the best estimate of the annual incidence of hepatitis C infection in IV drug users in town A is 100/10,000 = 0.01 or 1 per 1000.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the annual incidence, we need to focus on the new cases that emerged during the follow-up, which is 100 out of the initial 9,000 uninfected individuals. Therefore, the best estimate for the annual incidence would be 100/9,000.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Reoviridae family. It has a circular genome and contains 8 segments of dsRNA, which are transcribed into proteins in the cytoplasm. The viral RNA is then transported to the nucleus where it is translated into more RNA and DNA.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rotavirus, like many other viruses, possesses a double-stranded RNA genome, which provides stability and efficient replication.

However, the most important benefit is that it reduces the frequency of injection drug use which in turn can help prevent HIV transmission through shared needles.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection during breast feeding is increased due to mixed feeding, which involves the combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. This increases the likelihood that the mother will transmit the virus through her milk.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Introducing solids early would mean that the infant would rely less on breastfeeding, therefore reducing the risk of HIV-1 transmission. On the other hand, mixed feeding (i.e., both breast milk and formula) increases the risk of transmission due to the presence of blood in the breast milk. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The calcivirus family is a group of negative strand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. They use their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to transcribe their genome into mRNA, which is then translated into viral proteins. These proteins are assembled into new virus particles and released from the cell.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

However, other factors such as presence of other infections and condom use can also affect the likelihood of acquiring HIV.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Viruses are not considered living organisms because they cannot reproduce on their own and require a host cell to replicate. They have been around for much longer than bacteria, but bacteria were discovered before viruses. Viruses can be grown in the laboratory, but this does not mean that all viruses are grown in animals. Finally, while some viruses do cause human disease, not all of them do.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Viruses are much smaller and simpler than bacteria, making them easier to isolate and study in laboratory settings. Therefore, it's likely that viruses were discovered and grown in animals before bacteria. In addition, viruses have been found in all types of environments on Earth, including the ocean floor and outer space.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Filoviruses are a family of viruses that cause severe and often fatal diseases in humans and other primates, such as Ebola and Marburg. They have a unique morphology that consists of two types of particles: the large spherical particle called the nucleocapsid (NC) and the long filamentous particles called the filament (F). The NC contains the viral genome and is surrounded by a protein shell, while the F has an outer membrane and may contain additional proteins. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Filoviruses, as their name suggests, are filamentous and thread-like. This flexible structure likely means they lack a rigid and defined morphology, similar to amoebas. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. HIV was first identified in 1981, Rubella teratogenicity was first observed in the 1950s, Microcephaly and Zika were first reported in 2015, and Hepatitis C was first discovered in 1989.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The link between rubella infection and birth defects, such as teratogenicity, likely required extensive laboratory research and experimentation to establish a causal relationship.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is a combination of both killed and live vaccines.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The killed polio vaccine has been instrumental in reducing polio cases worldwide. Therefore, continued use and widespread administration of the killed vaccine should be sufficient to eradicate polio. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Knowledge is the information that a cell has about its environment and itself. This knowledge can be encoded in different forms, such as DNA, RNA or proteins. However, the most common way of transferring this knowledge from one part of the cell to another is through protein synthesis. Proteins are the molecules that carry out most of the functions in the cell, and they are made by translating the information stored in mRNA (messenger RNA) into amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cellular processes are often complex and involve numerous interactions between molecules. Therefore, the direction of knowledge flow within a cell is likely to be random and influenced by various factors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Positive strand RNA viruses are those that can directly translate their RNA into proteins without the need for an intermediate mRNA molecule. This is because they have a single-stranded RNA genome, which serves as both the genetic material and the messenger RNA (mRNA) in these viruses.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Picornaviruses, like retroviruses, need to convert their RNA into DNA for replication. Therefore, it's likely that picornavirus virions carry the RNA transcriptase enzyme into the cell. The most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV-associated tuberculosis is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment. Antiretrovirals are drugs used to treat HIV, but they do not directly target TB bacteria. Therefore, it is important to start antiretroviral therapy before starting TB treatment. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Antiretroviral drugs are essential for controlling HIV infection and boosting the immune system. Therefore, it's logical to start antiretroviral treatment before addressing tuberculosis to strengthen the body's ability to fight the infection. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Incidence is the number of new cases of a disease that occur in a population over a specified period of time, usually one year. Lifetime expectancy is the average number of years a person can expect to live based on current mortality rates. Lifetime prevalence is the proportion of individuals who have had a particular condition at some point during their lifetime. Period prevalence is the proportion of individuals with a particular condition in a given population at a specific point in time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement indicates that there were no new cases of Ebola during a specific period, which aligns with the concept of period prevalence, representing the proportion of a population with a disease during a particular time.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which can cause paralysis and death in some cases. The most effective way to prevent polio is through vaccination. However, there are several challenges that have prevented its eradication from the world. One of them is the inability to vaccinate in some countries due to political instability, conflict, or lack of resources. Another challenge is the poor quality (unsafe) vaccines that may not provide adequate protection against the virus. A third challenge is the genetic variation of the poliovirus, which can make it difficult to develop a universal vaccine. Finally, the expense of vaccination programs and the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring are also obstacles to eradication.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eradicating a disease globally requires a massive effort, and the cost of producing and distributing vaccines to every corner of the world must be a major hurdle. However, this is not the only challenge. In some countries, there are logistical issues that prevent vaccination campaigns from reaching all populations. Additionally, there may be cultural or political barriers that make it difficult to convince people to get vaccinated. Therefore, while cost and logistics are important factors, they do not fully explain why polio has not been eradicated yet.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent diseases, as they stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against specific pathogens. Antivirals and hygiene can help reduce the risk of infection, but they cannot provide complete protection. Mosquito nets can be useful in preventing mosquito-borne diseases, but they do not protect against other types of infections.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Antivirals directly target viruses and prevent them from replicating, thus effectively stopping the disease from developing. Vaccines work similarly but they prepare the immune system to recognize and fight off a specific virus before it can cause an infection. Hygiene practices such as washing hands and covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing can help reduce the spread of infectious diseases by removing pathogens from surfaces and preventing them from entering the body. Mosquito nets are effective in preventing malaria, but they do not prevent other types of infections. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Vaccines.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. MERS is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be transmitted from animals to humans.

A,"Let's reason step by step. A cytokine storm is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's immune system releases an excessive amount of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. This can lead to widespread inflammation and tissue damage. Antibody mediated reactions are not caused by viruses but rather by the production of antibodies in response to viral infections. A response of killer T cells (CD-8) is a type of immune cell that targets infected or cancerous cells. A decline in function of the immune system can occur as a result of various factors, including aging and certain diseases. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: A cytokine storm.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV is an RNA virus that has the ability to rapidly mutate, making it difficult for single drugs to completely inhibit its replication. This is why drug combinations are essential in treating HIV as they target different stages of the viral life cycle and reduce the likelihood of resistance developing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Combining multiple drugs makes it nearly impossible for the virus to develop resistance, as it would have to overcome the effects of all the drugs simultaneously. This is why drug combinations are essential in treating HIV.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The most common method for producing viral vaccines is through traditional cell culture, which involves growing the virus in a host cell and then harvesting it for use as a vaccine.

It tells us how contagious the infection is and can help predict its spread. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The reproductive number tells us how easily a virus spreads, so a higher number would naturally indicate a more severe and virulent infection. However, this is not always the case as other factors such as population density can also play a role.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Herpes viruses are a group of DNA viruses that cause various diseases, including herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). HSV causes cold sores or genital herpes, while VZV causes chickenpox and shingles. Both these viruses can be transmitted through direct contact with an infected person's skin lesions. However, they do not cause infantile paralysis, encephalitis, sexually transmitted diseases, or cancer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Herpesviruses are known to establish latent infections and can reactivate later in life, and this ability to integrate into the host genome is often linked to cancer development. Therefore, herpes viruses do not cause cancer.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The adaptive immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from pathogens. One of its most special characteristics is clonal expansion of pre-existing antibodies and/or T cells. This means that when the body encounters a pathogen for the first time, it produces specific antibodies or T cells that can recognize and eliminate the pathogen more efficiently in case of future exposure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The adaptive immune system relies heavily on T cells to recognize and eliminate pathogens, making them a central and unique component of this system. Therefore, the most special characteristic of the adaptive immune system is its reliance on T cells.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. A clinical trial is a type of study in which participants are randomly assigned to receive either the experimental treatment or a placebo, and then their outcomes are compared. This design allows for causal inference but may not be feasible or ethical in some cases. A double-blind study is one in which neither the participants nor the researchers know who received the treatment or the placebo, to minimize bias. A longitudinal study is one that follows the same group of individuals over time and measures their outcomes at multiple points. This design allows for causal inference but may be costly and subject to attrition. A prospective cohort study is one that selects a group of people who are exposed to an exposure (e.g., a toxin) and then follows them over time to see if they develop an outcome (e.g., cancer). This design also allows for causal inference but may suffer from confounding factors and selection bias.",D,"Let's reason step by step. This study design resembles a clinical trial, where a group of participants is exposed to a treatment and monitored for its effects over time.

Vaccination is not a viable option for astroviruses as they are RNA viruses and do not have the necessary components for an effective vaccine.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Emerging viruses like Zika and Ebola continue to plague us because they mutate and hence emerge, which means that the virus is constantly changing its genetic makeup, making it difficult for our immune system to recognize and fight off. This is why we need new vaccines every time a new strain of the virus emerges.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Viruses like Zika and Ebola pose a continuous threat due to their ability to mutate rapidly, allowing them to evade the immune system and emerge in new populations. This is why we see these viruses resurface periodically.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. RNA viruses are known to be hypermutable, meaning they can mutate rapidly and adapt quickly to new environments or hosts. This is due to the lack of proofreading mechanisms in their replication process. In contrast, DNA viruses have a more stable genome and therefore do not mutate as frequently.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Emerging viruses are known for their ability to adapt quickly to new environments and hosts, suggesting they have a high mutation rate, making them hypermutable. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'Emerging' viruses.",B
