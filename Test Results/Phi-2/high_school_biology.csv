D,"Let's reason step by step. Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four haploid daughter cells from one diploid parent cell. The process involves two rounds of division, meiosis I and meiosis II, each with different phases and events. Homologous chromosomes pair during prophase I, not prophase II. DNA replication occurs before both meiosis I and meiosis II, but only once for the entire organism. The number of chromosomes is reduced by half in each daughter cell, so the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Meiosis involves two divisions, so DNA must replicate twice to provide enough genetic material for all four daughter cells.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetic drift is a random process that can lead to changes in allele frequencies over time, especially in small populations. Gene flow is the movement of alleles between populations due to migration or interbreeding. Disruptive selection occurs when extreme phenotypes are favored over intermediate ones, leading to the divergence of two subpopulations. Discrete variation refers to differences in traits that can be easily measured and classified into categories. In this case, since the populations are located far from one another and have similar environmental conditions, it is unlikely that gene flow or disruptive selection is occurring. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is genetic drift.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two distinct genotypes, A1A1 and A2A2, the variation observed falls into clear categories, making it an example of discrete variation. The populations being located far from one another and having similar environmental conditions also suggests that gene flow is unlikely to be a major factor in this case.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys, and they are responsible for filtering blood and producing urine. The concentration of urine is determined by the amount of water reabsorbed in the collecting ducts. Kangaroo rats have evolved to live in arid environments where water is scarce, so their kidneys need to be able to concentrate urine efficiently. This means that the nephrons of kangaroo-rat kidneys would have longer loops of Henle, which allow for more water reabsorption and less dilution of urine.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  To concentrate urine effectively, kangaroo rats would need more time for water reabsorption, which would require longer collecting ducts. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C

A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is a polysaccharide that serves as an energy storage molecule in the body. In Pompe disease, glycogen accumulates in lysosomes because of a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which breaks down glycogen into glucose for energy production. This suggests that the malfunction is with enzymes in the lysosomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Since glycogen is accumulating within lysosomes, there must be an issue with transporting it into these organelles through endocytosis. Therefore, the answer must involve a malfunction in membrane transport during endocytosis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Since weight is highly heritable, it means that the offspring will inherit traits from their parents. In this case, the heaviest males and females survived and reproduced, so they are likely to pass on their genes for larger body size to their offspring. Therefore, the expected outcome would be a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The surviving horses represent the extreme end of the weight distribution. Their offspring are likely to have a lower mean weight due to the natural tendency to regress towards the average. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection states that organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than those without them. This means that the population will gradually change over time, but not necessarily in a gradual way or over a long period of time. In fact, some changes can occur rapidly due to environmental pressures. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A Barr body is a condensed, inactive form of the X chromosome that occurs during meiosis I in female cells. It forms when one of the two X chromosomes is randomly selected to be inactivated and then condensed into a dense structure called a Barr body. This process ensures that females have two functional copies of the X chromosome (one from each parent) while males only have one functional copy of the Y chromosome. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The Barr body is an inactivated Y chromosome found in males.

In this case, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution, which means it has more solutes than the beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. This creates a difference in solute potential, or osmotic pressure, between the two solutions. The water molecules will move from the higher concentration to the lower concentration until equilibrium is reached.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Water potential is determined solely by the concentration of solutes in a solution, which is known as solute potential.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Both incomplete dominance and epistasis describe situations where the expression of one gene is influenced by alleles at multiple loci. However, they differ in how this influence occurs. Incomplete dominance describes a situation where the heterozygous genotype results in an intermediate phenotype between the homozygous phenotypes for each allele. Epistasis, on the other hand, describes a situation where the expression of one gene is influenced by alleles at another locus.

It involves only one parent and produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Budding involves the fusion of genetic material from two parent organisms to produce offspring, making it a form of sexual reproduction. Fission is also a form of asexual reproduction in which an organism splits into two or more parts, each of which can grow into a new individual. Sporulation and meiosis are both forms of sexual reproduction. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement says that the resistant mosquitoes first appeared in India within 15 years of widespread spraying of the insecticide. This means that DDT was sprayed for a long time before the resistant mosquitoes were noticed, which implies that some mosquitoes must have been already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The rapid emergence of DDT-resistant mosquitoes suggests that the insecticide was not manufactured properly, rendering it ineffective against the target population. This means that some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when it was first sprayed, and their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Crossing-over is a process that occurs during prophase I of meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. This results in the formation of new combinations of alleles on each chromosome and contributes to genetic diversity.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The Gulf of Mexico is a large body of water that receives nutrients and organic matter from various sources, including rivers, streams, and atmospheric deposition. These inputs provide the necessary elements for phytoplankton growth, which in turn supports the marine food web. However, excessive nutrient loading can lead to eutrophication, a process by which algal blooms occur due to an overabundance of nutrients. This can result in oxygen depletion and dead zones. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: A summer influx of nutrients derived from chemical fertilizers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection is a process that leads to changes in the frequency of traits in a population over time, as individuals with certain advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce than those without them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection is all about the presence of variations in a population, which allows individuals with advantageous traits to thrive. Poorly adapted individuals never produce offspring, so they don't contribute to the gene pool. Species producing more offspring than the environment can support will eventually lead to overpopulation and resource depletion. Individuals whose characteristics are best suited to the environment generally leave more offspring than those whose characteristics are less suited. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that DNA sequences in many human genes are very similar to the corresponding sequences in chimpanzees suggests that humans and chimpanzees share a recent common ancestor. This is because over time, mutations accumulate in DNA sequences as organisms evolve. Therefore, it makes sense that humans and chimpanzees would have some similarities in their genetic makeup.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Convergent evolution is the process in which unrelated species evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. This means that hawkmoths and hummingbirds are not genetically related, so option C is incorrect. Similarly, analogous structures are those that have a common origin but serve different functions, like wings of birds and insects. Therefore, option D is also incorrect. Option A is correct because both organisms evolved similar traits due to similar environmental pressures.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Starch and cellulose are both polysaccharides composed of glucose monomers linked together by glycosidic bonds. However, the structure of these bonds differs between starch and cellulose. The bonds in starch are alpha-1,4-glycosidic, while those in cellulose are beta-1,4-glycosidic. This difference in bond type means that enzymes that break down alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds can digest starch but cannot digest beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds found in cellulose.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Starch molecules are likely much smaller and simpler than cellulose molecules, making them easier for our digestive enzymes to break down. The bonds linking the monomers of starch also differ in shape from those linking the monomers of cellulose, which makes it more difficult for our digestive enzymes to break down cellulose.",A

In this case, the most appropriate answer is a cross section of an anther as it shows the production of pollen which requires mitotic cell divisions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since leaves are actively growing and require cell division for development and repair, a cross-section of a leaf would likely showcase mitotic cell divisions. In contrast, muscle tissue is composed mostly of non-dividing cells that perform specialized functions.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The chief cause of genetic variation among human individuals is reshuffling of alleles in sexual reproduction. This process leads to new combinations of genes that are not present in either parent, and thus increases the diversity of the population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In a large population like humans, genetic drift, caused by random fluctuations in allele frequencies, is the primary source of genetic variation. This process can lead to the fixation or loss of alleles over time and is more pronounced in small populations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Homology refers to similarities between organisms that can be traced back to a common ancestor, while convergent evolution occurs when two unrelated species independently evolve similar traits due to similar environmental pressures. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B because if the two species share many proteins in common and have almost identical nucleotide sequences that code for these proteins, it suggests that they evolved from a common ancestor. On the other hand, if the sizes of the structures in adult members of both species are similar in size, it could be due to convergent evolution.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that both species are well-adapted to their environments and possess similar structures for the same function strongly suggests convergent evolution. This is because, in this case, natural selection has favored the development of a similar structure independently in each species due to the similar environmental pressures they face.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A diploid cell has two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the frequency of the black allele is 0.04 and the frequency of the brown allele is 0.96. The frequency of the heterozygous condition can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which states that p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p represents the frequency of the dominant allele (brown) and q represents the frequency of the recessive allele (black). Therefore, we have 0.96^2 + 2(0.96)(0.04) + 0.04^2 = 1. Solving for q, we get q = sqrt(1 - p^2 - 2pq), which is approximately equal to 0.4. Thus, the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 2pq = 2(0.96)(0.04) = 0.032 or 3.2 percent.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Vaccination is a process in which an individual is exposed to a weakened or dead form of a pathogen, so their immune system can develop immunity against it without getting sick. This exposure allows the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells that recognize and respond quickly to the pathogen if they encounter it again. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A because vaccination increases the number of different receptors that recognize a particular pathogen.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vaccination exposes the immune system to various epitopes of a pathogen, allowing it to recognize and respond to a wider range of antigenic variations.

The question is asking about the evolution of a male behavior, which means that we need to look for an explanation that involves changes in the frequency of certain traits over time. Frequency-dependent selection occurs when individuals with certain traits have higher fitness than those without them, but only if their numbers are low enough so that they do not become too common and lose their advantage. Artificial selection is a form of human intervention that selects for specific traits in domesticated animals or plants. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that favors traits that increase an individual's chances of mating or reproducing. Natural selection is the general process by which organisms with favorable traits survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.

This lack of gene flow allows for the evolution of unique adaptations in each population. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mainland likely offers a different variety of food sources compared to the Galápagos Islands, leading to the evolution of distinct adaptations in the finches. Additionally, South American predators may have limited the evolution of the mainland finch species. However, reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland because there are no geographical barriers preventing gene flow between populations. Finally, the available niches that the Darwin' finches exploited on the Galápagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.",A

The first stage of cellular respiration is glycolysis, which takes place in the cytoplasm and produces two molecules of pyruvate, two molecules of NADH, and two molecules of ATP. The second stage is the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the mitochondrial matrix and produces two more molecules of ATP, six molecules of NADH, and two molecules of FADH2. The final stage is the electron transport chain, which takes place on the inner membrane of the mitochondria and uses the energy from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons across the membrane and generate a proton gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP by ATP synthase. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is oxygen, not NAD+ or any other molecule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, releasing CO2 as a byproduct. This is the main source of CO2 in cellular respiration. In the electron transport chain, protons are pumped through ATP synthase by active transport, which generates ATP. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain is oxygen, not NAD+.

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that the allele frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation if certain conditions are met, including no mutation, migration, genetic drift or natural selection. In this case, we know that 70% of the gametes contain the A1 allele, which means that 30% must contain the A2 allele. Therefore, the proportion of flies carrying both A1 and A2 is 0.3 x 0.7 = 0.21.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 70% of the gametes contain the A1 allele, it follows that 49% of the flies carry both A1 and A2, making them heterozygous. The remaining 21% are homozygous for either A1 or A2.

The cerebellum is responsible for coordinating movements and balance. If it malfunctions, it would likely lead to memory loss and difficulty with recall. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Catastrophism was a theory proposed by Georges Cuvier in the early 19th century to explain the existence of fossils and geological formations that could not be explained by uniformitarianism, which states that the Earth's surface has changed gradually over time. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the fossil record.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cuvier's theory of catastrophism aimed to explain the gradual changes and diversity of life forms observed in the fossil record, suggesting that evolution occurred through a series of catastrophic events. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Warning coloration is a type of aposematic coloration that signals to potential predators that the animal possesses a chemical defense mechanism, such as toxins or venom. Batesian mimicry and cryptic coloration are both forms of protective coloration, but they do not involve warning signals. Deceptive markings can be used for various purposes, including camouflage and signaling, but they are not always associated with chemical defenses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Warning coloration in animals with chemical defenses is a form of deceptive markings, where the bright colors and patterns mislead predators into thinking they are poisonous or dangerous. In this case, the most appropriate answer is deceptive markings.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement, 'it is goal-directed', is incorrect because evolution does not have a specific goal or purpose. It is a natural process that occurs over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Evolution, as understood today, is essentially synonymous with the process of gene flow, where the movement of genes between populations leads to changes in allele frequencies. This can result from a variety of mechanisms such as migration or interbreeding.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Evolution is the process of change in all forms of life over generations, and it can occur through different mechanisms. Divergent evolution occurs when two related species evolve in a way that makes them less similar, usually due to adaptation to different environments or niches. Convergent evolution occurs when two unrelated species evolve in a way that makes them more similar, usually due to similar selective pressures. Parallel evolution occurs when two related species evolve independently in the same direction, usually due to shared ancestry or gene flow. Coevolution occurs when two or more species influence each other's evolution through reciprocal adaptations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When two related species evolve in a way that makes them less similar, it is an example of parallel evolution, where they experience similar changes while remaining distinct. In this case, the most appropriate answer is parallel evolution.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Genetic variation is created by mutations, genetic recombination and gene flow. Natural selection acts upon this variation to increase or decrease its frequency in a population.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The processes involved in gamete production, such as meiosis, tend to reduce genetic variation by halving the chromosome number and eliminating some alleles. Therefore, option D is true.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The transformation of a normal mammalian cell into a cancer cell is usually associated with the incorporation of the viral genome into the mammalian cell's nuclear DNA. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When a virus transforms a mammalian cell into a cancer cell, the host's genome is converted into viral DNA, allowing the virus to replicate and control the cell's functions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prokaryotic cells are simpler in structure than animal cells and lack a nucleus, while animal cells have a well-defined nucleus. Additionally, prokaryotes do not contain membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts that are present in eukaryotic cells. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Ribosomes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ribosomes are organelles found only in eukaryotic cells and are responsible for protein synthesis. Therefore, their presence or absence can distinguish between prokaryotic and animal cells. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Zika fever\u201a West Nile fever\u201a and malaria are caused by viruses, so option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Zika fever, West Nile fever, and malaria are all transmitted by mosquitoes, they must be caused by viruses, as mosquitoes are known vectors for viral diseases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time, depending on their effects on survival and reproduction. The smallest unit upon which natural selection directly acts is an individual's phenotype, as it determines how well they can survive and reproduce in their environment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection acts directly on an individual's genome, selecting for beneficial genes and eliminating harmful ones, ultimately leading to changes in the population. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Interspecific breeding is the process of reproduction between two species that are not closely related. For interspecific breeding to occur, there must be some barriers preventing mating between individuals from different species. These barriers can include geographic isolation (when populations are separated by physical barriers), behavioral isolation (when individuals have different behaviors or preferences), and temporal isolation (when individuals breed at different times). However, having similar courtship rituals or breeding seasons does not prevent interspecific breeding. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Geographic isolation implies that two species are in close proximity, increasing the likelihood of interaction and potential breeding. Behavioral isolation refers to differences in behavior between two species, which can prevent them from mating successfully. Courtship rituals are specific behaviors used during courtship, but they do not necessarily prevent interspecific breeding. Breeding seasons refer to the time when a particular species is most likely to mate, so it does not prevent interspecific breeding either.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Genetic drift is a random process that can lead to changes in allele frequencies within a population over time, especially when the population size is small or isolated. In this case, the most appropriate answer is genetic drift.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In a new environment, individuals with extreme traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, leading to disruptive selection and a change in the gene pool. This is most likely to occur when a small population of birds is blown to an isolated island by a hurricane and establishes a colony.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Evolution is the process of change in all forms of life over generations. It can be driven by several mechanisms, including mutation, non-random mating, gene flow and natural selection. However, natural selection is the most consistent at causing populations to become better suited to their environments over time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Non-random mating, such as selective breeding for desirable traits, consistently improves the fitness of populations over generations. This is because it increases the frequency of beneficial alleles in a population.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a piece of potato is dropped into pure water, it will absorb water from its surroundings and expand. This process is called osmosis. The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The potato has a higher solute concentration than the pure water, so water will naturally flow out of the potato to balance the concentration gradient. This process is called osmosis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for a statement that is NOT correct about ancient Earth. We can eliminate options A and B because they are both true statements. Option C is also true, but it does not contradict any other option. Therefore, the answer must be D. The presence of free oxygen did facilitate the rapid formation of organic molecules, so this statement is incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With Earth being 4 billion years old, there was ample time for organic molecules to form rapidly and spontaneously, even without free oxygen. Volcanic eruptions could have provided the necessary energy for amino acid synthesis, but this is not a unique feature of ancient Earth.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Crossing-over during meiosis is the process in which homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of alleles on each chromosome. This means that crossing-over can increase the genetic diversity of offspring and thus provide a mechanism for evolution to occur.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Crossing-over introduces new combinations of alleles, effectively increasing the rate of mutations and genetic diversity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, producing energy in the form of ATP and NADH. Fermentation is an alternative pathway that occurs when oxygen is not available to continue glycolysis. During fermentation, pyruvate is converted into either lactate or ethanol, depending on the organism. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fermentation, like glycolysis, needs to produce ATP, so the reaction ADP + P → ATP must occur in the reverse direction to provide energy. The other reactions are correct for both directions of these processes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Animal cells are eukaryotic, meaning they have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Plant cells also have these features but in addition to them, plant cells have cell walls made of cellulose, large vacuoles that store water, and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Lysosomes are found only in animal cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lysosomes are responsible for breaking down waste and debris, a function more crucial for animal cells than plant cells, so they are more likely to be found in animal cells. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peroxisomes are organelles that contain enzymes that can catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide, provide cellular energy in the form of ATP, and make proteins. Mitochondria are also involved in producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and making some proteins. Lysosomes are responsible for breaking down waste materials and recycling their components. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lysosomes break down nutrients for energy, chloroplasts use sunlight to create proteins, and ribosomes assemble those proteins. Peroxisomes catalyze reactions involving hydrogen peroxide, but they do not provide cellular energy or make proteins. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Phagocytosis is a process in which cells engulf and digest foreign particles, such as bacteria or dead cells. The vesicle formed during phagocytosis will contain the contents of the engulfed particle. If it merges with a lysosome, then the contents would be digested by enzymes within the lysosome.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After phagocytosis, the vesicle will naturally release its contents into the cytoplasm where enzymes will break down the engulfed material. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. All of these statements are true except for D, which is false. Epinephrine does not increase blood sugar levels or heart rate but rather has the opposite effect. It stimulates the ""fight or flight"" response and increases both blood sugar levels and heart rate.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vasopressin acts on the kidneys, which are responsible for filtering waste and removing excess water, so it likely decreases water storage in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Variation is a fundamental concept in biology, and it can be classified into different types based on its source and effect. In this case, we need to identify which statement accurately describes the nature of variation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Any change in the genetic makeup will directly result in a visible change in the organism's traits, leading to phenotypic variation. Therefore, all genetic variations produce phenotypic variation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. If two modern organisms are distantly related in an evolutionary sense, then one should expect that they share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If two organisms are distantly related, they have evolved along separate paths for a long time, leading to adaptations for different habitats and lifestyles. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would share many homologous structures or chromosomes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The pedigree shows that both parents are carriers for the recessive allele, which means they have one normal and one mutated copy of the gene. Therefore, each child has a 25% chance of inheriting two copies of the mutated allele and being affected with alkaptonuria.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Woman 1 doesn't have the disease and alkaptonuria is recessive, so she must have two copies of the normal allele, making her genotype X-X. The P generation mother is also X-X, which means that both parents are carriers for the disease.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. An organism exposed to wild temperature fluctuations shows very little, if any, change in its metabolic rate. This organism is most probably a ectotherm.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ectotherms rely on external sources to regulate their body temperature, so their metabolic rate remains relatively constant even with temperature changes. Endotherms, however, can generate heat internally and maintain a stable internal temperature regardless of the environment. Thermophiles are organisms that thrive in high temperatures, while ascospores are spores produced by fungi.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support, flexibility, and cushioning to various parts of the body. It is not a part of the skeletal system but rather a component of it. Bone, on the other hand, is composed of collagen and salts and contains blood vessels and nerves. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is part of the skeletal system, just like bone, so their main difference must lie elsewhere. Bone is composed of collagen and salts, while cartilage lacks these components.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Artificial selection is the process of selecting organisms with desirable traits and breeding them to produce offspring with those same traits. Directional selection occurs when one extreme phenotype is favored over another, leading to a shift in the average value of that trait. Stabilizing selection occurs when both extremes are selected against, resulting in an increase in the average value of that trait. Disruptive selection occurs when two different phenotypes are favored, leading to a split in the population into two distinct groups. In this case, the most appropriate answer is stabilizing selection.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The consistent birth weight suggests that natural selection favors babies around 3 kg, leading to directional selection towards this optimal weight. In contrast, artificial selection is when humans intentionally select certain traits in plants or animals for breeding purposes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. All of these options are related to respiration, but only one is not a direct cause or effect of it. An increase in the amount of CO2 in the blood (option A) indicates that more carbon dioxide is being produced than can be eliminated through breathing, which leads to respiratory acidosis and a decrease in pH level. A decrease in the amount of O2 in the blood (option B) means that less oxygen is available for cellular respiration, leading to hypoxia and fatigue. A decrease in the plasma pH level (option C) also indicates respiratory acidosis, as CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which lowers the pH. Strenuous exercise (option D) increases the demand for oxygen and energy, but does not directly affect respiration itself.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A decrease in plasma pH indicates higher acidity, which is often associated with increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during respiration. Therefore, the correct answer must be one of the other options.",D
A,Let's reason step by step. Mules are hybrids between a male donkey and a female horse. They have a relatively low reproductive success because they cannot produce viable offspring with either parent.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Since mules cannot undergo meiosis, their DNA cannot be shuffled and recombined, so mutations are unable to occur and introduce new genetic variation. Additionally, since the offspring of a mule is sterile, they will not contribute any genetic material to future generations.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lipids are organic molecules that serve as energy storage, insulation, and structural components in living organisms. They consist of fatty acids and glycerol, which can be saturated or unsaturated depending on the number of double bonds between carbon atoms. Steroids are a type of lipid that includes hormones such as cortisol and testosterone. The molecules of a saturated fatty acid are packed so close together that they form a solid at room temperature, while the head of a phospholipid is hydrophobic (water-repelling) and the tails are hydrophilic (water-attracting). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Steroids, like other lipids, have a structure that repels water on the outside and attracts water on the inside, leading to the hydrophobic head and hydrophilic tails. Therefore, statement B is not correct.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The start codon is AUG, which codes for the amino acid methionine. Any change that alters this sequence would most likely have a deleterious effect on protein synthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a single nucleotide substitution of the nucleotide occupying the first codon position.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Deletions, whether of a single nucleotide or a triplet, disrupt the reading frame of the mRNA, leading to a significant shift in the encoded amino acid sequence. This can result in a non-functional protein or even an entirely different one. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a deletion of a nucleotide triplet.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. All of the statements are correct except for D. An individual with two identical alleles is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Alleles represent the various forms a gene can take, such as those responsible for different eye colors or blood types. They are found on corresponding loci of homologous chromosomes and an individual with two identical alleles is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The endosymbiotic theory proposes that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by ancestral eukaryotic cells, forming a symbiotic relationship. This theory is supported by several lines of evidence, including the presence of circular DNA in both organelles, their ability to divide independently of the host cell, and their possession of their own ribosomes. The correct answer is D because mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria have a single, circular chromosome without histones or proteins.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ability of mitochondria and chloroplasts to divide on their own, similar to bacteria, suggests they were once self-sufficient entities. However, the presence of ribosomes that resemble those of eukaryotic cells indicates a closer relationship with eukaryotes than prokaryotes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into pyruvate, which produces ATP and NADH. Chemiosmosis is the process of using the energy from the proton gradient to produce ATP. Fermentation is a process that occurs in the absence of oxygen, where pyruvate is converted into lactate or ethanol. The Calvin cycle is a series of reactions that occur during photosynthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is glycolysis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fermentation is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to produce energy, often resulting in the formation of sugars like ethanol or lactic acid. This process does not require oxygen and produces NADH instead of NAD+. Therefore, fermentation is an appropriate answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Prokaryotes are organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have a defined nucleus and many membrane-bound organelles. Therefore, all of the given options except for option D are differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes possess membrane-bound organelles, such as the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum, which compartmentalize cellular functions. Therefore, option D is not a difference between them.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Neutral variation is defined as genetic variation that does not affect an organism's fitness or survival. Therefore, it should have no effect on any of the measures we use to quantify evolutionary processes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is nucleotide diversity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Neutral variations, by definition, do not affect the survival or reproductive success of individuals, thus they should not influence nucleotide diversity within a population. Average heterozygosity is also unaffected by neutral variation because it only measures the proportion of heterozygotes in a population. Our ability to measure the rate of evolution is also not affected by neutral variation since we can still use molecular clocks and other methods that are based on genetic differences between populations. Finally, relative fitness is not directly influenced by neutral variation either, but rather by selection pressures acting on specific traits.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gravitational force is the force that pulls objects towards each other. Plants grow in the direction of gravity, which means they are positively gravitropic. Therefore, an example of a plant growing against gravity would be negative gravitropism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The plant's upward growth, opposite to the pull of gravity, indicates a positive thigmotropic response, as it actively seeks contact with a support structure. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Darwin was an English naturalist who is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he published in 1859. During his lifetime, the concept of evolution was not widely accepted and was often met with skepticism or outright rejection. Therefore, it is likely that Darwin would have found the definition of evolution as ""the gradual change of a population' s heritable traits over generations"" to be most foreign to him.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection emphasizes the gradual change of a population's traits over generations, resulting in the adaptation of organisms to their environments.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Aposomatic coloration is a type of camouflage that involves the animal's body shape and behavior, rather than its physical appearance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The animal's patterns serve as a form of Batesian mimicry, where it resembles a dangerous or unpalatable species to avoid predation. This is an effective defense mechanism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is correct, as innate immunity does rely on circulating phagocytes engulfing foreign substances. The second statement is also true, as adaptive immunity is a slower response than innate immunity. However, the third statement is incorrect because innate immunity activates an innate immune response, not a humoral response. Finally, the fourth statement is false because dendritic cells are antigen presenting cells, not phagocytes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dendritic cells, like phagocytes, are involved in the initial response of the innate immune system by engulfing pathogens and presenting antigens to other immune cells. Therefore, statement A is correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A segment of DNA is composed of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the building blocks of DNA. Each nucleotide consists of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), or guanine (G). A single strand of the original DNA segment contains the same number of nucleotides as the original sequence. However, after a point mutation, where one base is replaced by another, the number of nucleotides remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The primary RNA transcript, synthesized directly from the DNA template, contains the fewest nucleotides as it lacks the non-coding intron sequences. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C

C,"Let's reason step by step. The immune system has a memory component that allows it to recognize and respond more quickly to previously encountered pathogens. In this case, the man's second exposure to the flu strain likely triggered the activation of his memory cells, which led to a faster recovery.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The faster recovery upon second exposure to the flu is due to the action of cytotoxic T cells, which quickly recognize and destroy virus-infected cells, limiting the spread of the infection. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen bonding is one of the most important interactions that determine the folding and stability of proteins. It occurs between hydrogen atoms bonded to electronegative atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine. The strength of this interaction depends on the distance between the two atoms and the angle at which they are positioned. Therefore, a protein that has a rigid structure with little flexibility is less likely to be affected by hydrogen bonding than one that can bend and twist easily.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in determining the tertiary structure of a protein, as it influences the folding and interactions between different regions of the polypeptide chain. Therefore, the statement that describes the structural level of a protein that is least affected by hydrogen bonding must be false.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. Oligomycin blocks proton channels in the cristae of mitochondria, which are responsible for generating ATP (energy) through oxidative phosphorylation. Without these channels, protons cannot flow back into the matrix, leading to a buildup of H+ ions inside the intermembrane space and a decrease in pH. This would result in an increase in H+ concentration outside the mitochondria.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking proton channels with oligomycin would disrupt the proton gradient, leading to an accumulation of water within the mitochondria as a result of osmosis.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Metafemale syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when an egg cell with two X chromosomes fails to separate from the other cells during meiosis I, resulting in an extra copy of the X chromosome in the daughter cell. This failure would occur in metaphase I, where the homologous chromosomes align at the equator of the cell and prepare for separation.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The first simple cells evolved approximately 3.5 billion years ago, followed by the more complex eukaryotic cells 2.1 billion years ago. This means that the eukaryotic cell is a much more recent development than the prokaryotic cell.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eukaryotic cells are significantly more complex than prokaryotic cells, with organelles and a nucleus, so they must have completely different structures. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B

In this case, we are looking for characteristics that do not apply to asexual reproduction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Asexual reproduction involves the formation of gametes, which are haploid, so the parent cell must produce diploid cells to maintain chromosome number. The daughter cells produced through asexual reproduction are genetically identical to the parent cell and do not fuse with other cells to form a zygote.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Frameshift mutations are caused by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which can shift the reading frame and change the entire sequence of amino acids in a protein. This is not an example of a frameshift mutation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the mutation causes symptoms despite amino acids being added, it must be a nonsense mutation that prematurely stops protein synthesis. The correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Directional selection occurs when a population shifts towards the extreme ends of a trait, which can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the environment. Stabilizing selection occurs when a population shifts towards the average value of a trait, which is usually beneficial for survival and reproduction. Disruptive selection occurs when a population splits into two distinct groups with different values of a trait, which can lead to speciation. Sympatric speciation occurs when new species arise within the same geographic area without any physical barriers. In this case, the most appropriate answer is directional selection.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The decrease in frequency of both extremes suggests a selection pressure favoring one of the extreme phenotypes, indicating directional selection. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. All organisms require energy to survive, but this is not a strong enough piece of evidence to support the common origin of all life on Earth. Similarly, while all organisms use essentially the same genetic code, this does not necessarily imply that they share a common ancestor.

Each organ has a specific function in this process, such as producing enzymes, acids, or bile. The mouth is where digestion begins with the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food by chewing and saliva. The stomach is where most of the protein digestion occurs with the help of hydrochloric acid and pepsin. The gall bladder stores and releases bile, which helps emulsify fats. The small intestine is where most of the nutrient absorption takes place with the help of pancreatic enzymes and intestinal juice. Therefore, the only organ that does not secrete digestive enzymes in this system is the mouth.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that these birds have different ecological niches, meaning they occupy different roles in the ecosystem and do not compete directly with each other.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The absence of competition among the bird species suggests a scarcity of resources within the cactus, forcing the birds to occupy distinct niches to avoid direct competition. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this phenomenon is that these birds have different ecological niches.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The atmosphere on primitive Earth was believed to have been composed of methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water vapor. However, the most abundant gas in the early atmosphere is thought to be carbon dioxide.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Primitive Earth's atmosphere lacked oxygen but contained abundant ammonia, which played a crucial role in the formation of organic molecules necessary for life. Methane was also present in large amounts as it is produced by anaerobic bacteria and other organisms.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Darwin's theory of evolution states that the process of natural selection acts on inherited variations within populations, leading to changes over time. Therefore, any statement that contradicts this principle would be rejected by Darwin. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Darwin believed that environmental changes directly induce adaptations in organisms, leading to the evolution of new traits over time. He also rejected the idea that individual organisms can acquire new characteristics as they respond to new environments or situations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hemophilia is a recessive, X-linked trait, which means it only affects males because they have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females with Turner's syndrome have an extra X chromosome, so they are carriers of the hemophilia gene but do not express the disorder themselves.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The high incidence of hemophilia in females with Turner's syndrome suggests that they have red blood cells that clump together, leading to clotting problems. This is a recessive trait, meaning it requires two copies of the gene for it to be expressed. Since females only have one X chromosome, if this chromosome carries the hemophilia gene, they will develop the condition.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The child can have type O blood if both parents are heterozygous for the O allele, meaning they each carry one copy of the O allele and one copy of another blood type allele (B or A). This results in a 25% chance that the child will inherit two copies of the O allele from both parents, resulting in type O blood. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since type O blood is recessive, there is a 25% chance that the child inherits the recessive O allele from both parents, resulting in type O blood. The other possibilities are either having one A or B allele and one O allele (type AB) or two A or B alleles (type B). Therefore, the answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a recessive allele, which means that individuals must inherit two copies of the gene to develop the disorder. Since heterozygous individuals will show no symptoms, they are able to reproduce and pass on the gene. This explains how the allele and its associated disease are preserved in the population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Tay-Sachs is a recessive disease, individuals who are homozygous recessive for the allele will not show any symptoms and can therefore reproduce. This means that the allele will be passed on to future generations even though it causes severe illness in those who inherit two copies of it. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Homologous structures are anatomical features that have similar origins but may serve different functions in different organisms. They provide evidence for common ancestry and evolution, as they suggest that the organisms share a common ancestor with these structures. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A, because the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are not homologous structures, but analogous ones, which have similar functions but different origins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Homologous structures are those that share a similar function, like the flippers of both porpoises and seals, which are used for swimming. However, they do not necessarily have to look alike or perform the same function. For example, the wings of birds and bats serve different functions (flight vs. gliding), but they share a common ancestor that had wings.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A change in a neuron membrane potential from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts is considered depolarization, which means that the inside of the cell becomes less negative than the outside. This allows for an action potential to be generated.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Depolarization is when the membrane potential becomes more positive, so going from +50 mV to -70 mV is a clear example of depolarization. Repolarization is when the membrane potential returns to its resting state, hyperpolarization is when it becomes even more negative than before and an action potential is a rapid change in voltage that triggers nerve impulses.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Directional selection occurs when a certain trait is favored over others, leading to an increase in the frequency of that trait within a population. In this case, taller giraffes are able to obtain more nutrients and survive better than shorter ones, so they are more likely to pass on their genes for height. This results in a shift towards taller individuals within the population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Stabilizing selection favors the average individuals in a population, leading to a reduction in variation over time, which is what we see with the giraffes becoming taller. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Crossover occurs when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material during meiosis, which results in new combinations of alleles. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A because two genes are located right next to each other on chromosome A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Crossover is more likely to occur between genes on the X chromosome because it allows for greater genetic diversity in offspring. In this case, the most appropriate answer is option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The primary function of stomata is to allow gas exchange between the plant and its environment. When a drop of soap is added to the water, it reduces the surface tension of the liquid, allowing the leaf disks to float more easily. This makes it easier for them to sink into the water, which helps submerge them.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Soap is known to remove air bubbles from surfaces, so it likely helps submerge the leaf disks by removing the air bubbles trapped on their surface. The correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Directional selection is the process of natural selection that favors individuals with extreme traits, leading to a shift in the population's average trait value over time. In this case, the most appropriate answer is directional selection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Disruptive selection favors individuals at both extremes of a trait, which explains why starlings with either fewer or more eggs have reduced fitness. Directional selection is when one extreme of the trait is favored over the other, while stabilizing selection occurs when the average value of the trait is favored. Artificial selection is when humans selectively breed organisms for specific traits.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Reptile eggs have an extraembryonic membrane that functions in excretion and respiration, which is different from the amnion, chorion or yolk sac. The most appropriate answer is the allantois.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The amnion is a membrane filled with fluid that surrounds the embryo, providing a suitable environment for gas exchange and waste removal. The chorion is a membrane that lines the yolk sac and provides nutrients to the developing embryo. The allantois is a membrane that connects the yolk sac to the outside of the egg and helps in excretion. The yolk sac is responsible for supplying nutrients to the developing embryo. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the amnion.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which means that both parents must carry the sickle-cell gene for their child to inherit the disease. If both parents are carriers of the sickle-cell gene, there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit two copies of the gene and develop sickle-cell disease.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If both parents are carriers of sickle-cell disease, their child will definitely inherit the disease because they will receive one copy of the recessive allele from each parent. Therefore, the chance that the child will inherit sickle-cell disease is 100%. The answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The three populations of fish have become three separate species, which means that they can no longer interbreed and produce fertile offspring. This indicates that there are significant differences between them in terms of their genetic makeup. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A) There are differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Speciation often involves changes in early developmental processes, such as the type of cleavage that produces the first blastomeres, leading to differences among the species. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hemoglobin is a molecule that binds to both O2 and CO2. There is an allosteric relationship between the concentrations of O2 and CO2. Hemoglobin' affinity for O2 decreases as blood pH decreases, which means it can bind more CO2 than O2. This is why when we breathe in air with high CO2 concentration, our lungs release more CO2 to increase the pH and make hemoglobin more sensitive to O2.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Exercising muscle tissue requires more oxygen, so hemoglobin's affinity for O2 should increase in these tissues to meet the higher demand. In addition, an allosteric relationship between O2 and CO2 means that as CO2 concentration increases, hemoglobin' affinity for O2 decreases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Eukaryotic cells are complex structures that contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. The cytoplasm is the fluid inside the cell where many cellular processes occur, including DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Therefore, all three of these processes must take place in the cytoplasm.",D,Let's reason step by step. Both transcription and translation are processes involved in protein synthesis and occur in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. DNA replication is a process that occurs in the nucleus.,D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The pH scale measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution, with lower values indicating higher concentrations and vice versa. A pH of 8.0 means that Lake A has a high concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) and is therefore alkaline. On the other hand, a pH of 6.0 indicates that Lake B has a low concentration of OH- and is therefore acidic. The correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A lower pH value indicates a higher level of alkalinity, so Lake B with a pH of 6.0 is 100 times more alkaline than Lake A with a pH of 8.0. The hydrogen ion concentration can be calculated using the formula 10^(-pH). Therefore, the hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is 10^(-6) M = 1 x 10^(-6) M.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sporulation is a form of asexual reproduction that involves the formation and dispersal of spores, which are resistant structures capable of developing into new individuals under favorable conditions. Binary fission is another form of asexual reproduction in which an organism divides into two identical daughter cells. Vegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction in plants where new individuals arise from vegetative parts such as stems or leaves. Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variability, as it introduces changes in the DNA sequence that can be passed on to offspring. In this case, the most appropriate answer is mutation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sporulation involves the production of spores, which can introduce new genetic combinations into a population, thus contributing to genetic variability. Binary fission and vegetative propagation are forms of asexual reproduction that do not contribute to genetic variability.",A

Unsaturated fatty acids are not linked to heart disease but rather can be beneficial for cardiovascular health when consumed in moderation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Steroids are a type of lipid, so they must also consist of glycerol and fatty acids, similar to other lipids like triglycerides. Unsaturated fatty acids can be linked to heart disease, but this is not the case for all unsaturated fats. Lipids make up most cell surface receptors, but this statement does not apply to all lipids. Phospholipids are water soluble, so this statement is incorrect.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption in humans. It receives partially digested food from the stomach, where it has been mixed with gastric juices containing hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen. In the small intestine, pancreatic lipase breaks down fats to fatty acids and glycerol, while amylase breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. Bile emulsifies fats into smaller fat particles, which increases their surface area for absorption. However, proteins are broken down by proteases in the stomach and small intestine, not pepsin. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bile is responsible for breaking down fats into smaller fat particles, which aids in their digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Therefore, option D does not take place in the small intestine.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Water flows from hypertonic to hypotonic, which means that the concentration of solutes is higher in the solution outside the cell than inside it. This causes water to move into the cell through osmosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Germinating seeds are in a dormant state and require minimal energy, so they use less oxygen compared to actively growing, non-germinating seeds. The rate of transpiration is dependent on the surface area of the leaves, not air movement. And finally, larger DNA fragments have more mass and therefore move slower than smaller ones during gel electrophoresis.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of alleles remains constant from generation to generation if certain conditions are met. These include no mutation, no migration, random mating, and large population size. If these conditions hold true for this population, then we can expect that the allele frequency will remain at 0.3 after 500 years.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The bottleneck effect maintains allele frequencies in a population over time, similar to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so the frequency of the allele will remain at 0.3.

The capsid is the protein shell that surrounds the genetic material of the virus, which can be either DNA or RNA. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since viruses are essentially genetic material enclosed in a protein coat, their two principal components must be DNA and proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. An exergonic reaction is one that releases energy, while an endergonic reaction requires energy to proceed. In this case, we are looking for an example of two reactions that occur together, with the first being exergonic and the second endergonic. The correct answer is D because the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain in mitochondria powers the pumping of protons against a gradient into the outer compartment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Coupling reactions involve the transfer of energy from one reaction to another, like how the hydrolysis of water releases electrons that replace those lost by chlorophyll a during photosynthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cyclins and protein kinases are both involved in the control of cell division, as they regulate the progression of the cell cycle. Checkpoints are also important for ensuring that each phase of the cell cycle is completed correctly before proceeding to the next one. Fibroblast cells, on the other hand, are not known to be directly involved in the control of cell division.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cyclins are proteins that form part of the cytoskeleton, providing structural support and facilitating cell movement, so they wouldn't be directly involved in cell division control. Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions, including those related to cell cycle progression, making them a likely candidate for involvement in cell division control. Checkpoints are regulatory mechanisms that monitor DNA replication and repair, ensuring the integrity of genetic material before proceeding with cell division. Fibroblast cells are fibrous connective tissue cells that produce collagen and other extracellular matrix components, so they wouldn't be directly involved in cell division control either.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sexual selection is a type of natural selection that favors traits that increase an individual's ability to attract mates and reproduce. Disruptive selection, on the other hand, occurs when extreme phenotypes are favored over intermediate ones. Balancing selection occurs when both extremes and intermediates are favored equally. Frequency-dependent selection occurs when the fitness of individuals depends on their relative frequency in a population. In this case, the most appropriate answer is sexual selection.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Balancing selection aims to maintain a balanced distribution of traits within a population, so in this case, it would ensure that both sexes receive equal care and resources. Disruptive selection is the opposite - it favors extreme phenotypes over intermediate ones.

Frequency-dependent selection occurs when the frequency of a trait changes depending on its prevalence in the population. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template.

A repressor protein binds to the promoter and prevents RNA polymerase from binding, thus inhibiting transcription. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a repressor.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Enhancers are DNA sequences that bind to specific proteins to increase the rate of transcription, effectively blocking RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter. Repressors, on the other hand, bind to DNA and prevent RNA polymerase from transcribing the gene. Operators are regions of DNA that control the initiation or termination of transcription. Promoters are sequences of DNA that initiate transcription by binding RNA polymerase.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The dominant allele B codes for black fur, the recessive allele b codes for brown hair. If an animal has two copies of the dominant allele (BBEe), it will have black fur. If an animal has one copy of the dominant allele and one copy of the recessive allele (BbEe), it will also have black fur because the dominant allele B masks the effect of the recessive allele b. However, if an animal has two copies of the recessive allele (Bbee), it will have brown hair because there is no dominant allele to mask the effect of the recessive allele b. If an animal has two copies of the recessive allele and one copy of the dominant allele (BBee), it will be yellow because there is no dominant allele to mask the effect of the recessive allele e.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since B codes for black fur and is dominant, and E is also dominant, the presence of both B and E alleles would result in a brown Labrador. However, since e is recessive to E, if an animal has two copies of the e allele (eE or eee), it will have yellow fur regardless of its genotype at the black/brown locus.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first sentence of the question states that tropical rain forests are being cut down, which means that they are being destroyed. This destruction has a number of negative consequences for both humans and animals. One such consequence is that indigenous populations will lose their homes and be forced to relocate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Deforestation allows for the development of new settlements and infrastructure, providing indigenous populations with access to modern conveniences and improving their quality of life. However, deforestation also has negative consequences that must be considered. One such consequence is a decrease in precipitation due to the loss of trees that help regulate local weather patterns.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The researcher is observing a process called ""incomplete dominance"". This occurs when neither allele is completely dominant over the other, resulting in an intermediate phenotype. In this case, the new variant has a distinct phenotype that cannot be produced through breeding with the original phenotype. However, it can be bred with itself to produce offspring with the same phenotype.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fallow deer are known for their territorial behavior, which can lead to reproductive isolation between different groups, resulting in distinct phenotypes and the inability to interbreed. Fruit flies, on the other hand, have a short generation time and high mutation rate, making it easier for new variants to emerge and be bred with each other. Grass is an autotrophic organism that reproduces through spores, while spotted toads are amphibians that reproduce sexually. None of these options exhibit the process described in the question.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The allele that was previously fixed is now undergoing a mutation, which introduces a new allele into the gene pool. This means that there are two alleles present in the population at this locus. Natural selection then causes stabilizing selection at this locus, meaning that individuals with either of these alleles will be favored over those with other genotypes. Consequently, what should happen over the course of many generations? The proportion of both types of homozygote should decrease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Stabilizing selection favors the intermediate phenotype, which in this case is represented by the heterozygous genotype, so the proportions of both homozygotes would decrease over time. In contrast, the proportion of heterozygotes should remain constant because they are neither favored nor disfavored by natural selection.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Legumes have a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain bacteria, which can convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates that the plants can use for growth. This process is called nitrogen fixation and it allows legumes to grow well in soils that are otherwise deficient in nitrogen.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Bacteria and eukaryotes have their own cell walls that surround them, while archaea do not. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: viruses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Archaea have a distinct cell wall structure that often includes protein components, providing protection and support, so they are likely to be surrounded by a protein coat. In contrast, viruses do not have a cell wall or any other structural features, making them unable to form a protein coat.",D

As altitude increases, the environmental conditions change, leading to random changes in the gene pool of the plant populations. This is an example of genetic drift.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The evolutionary unit is the smallest unit of natural selection that can be studied independently from other units. This means that genetic changes can only occur at the population level, as it is the group of individuals that are being studied. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection favors certain populations with advantageous traits, leading to the evolution of the entire group. This means that a population is the evolutionary unit because it is the level at which genetic changes occur and natural selection acts.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first group consists of Aristotle, who believed that species were fixed, while the second group includes Cuvier and Lamarck, who both proposed theories about evolution.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck all adhered to the traditional view of fixed species, classifying organisms based on unchanging characteristics. Aristotle, Lyell, and Cuvier were more open-minded about evolution and change in species.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The more closely related two different organisms are, the more similar their DNA sequences should be. This is because they share a recent common ancestor and therefore have inherited many of the same genetic traits.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If two organisms are closely related, it means they likely evolved in similar habitats and faced similar selective pressures. This would lead to more similarities between their DNA sequences, which is what we see when we compare the genomes of different species.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The fluidity of a cell's plasma membrane is determined by the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds in their tails to those without double covalent bonds in their tails. Double covalent bonds restrict movement, so an increase in this ratio would decrease fluidity. Therefore, changing the ratio of phospholipids would be a viable strategy for maintaining homeostasis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. By exchanging phospholipids from one side of the membrane to the other, the cell can maintain a balanced composition and ensure proper fluidity. This is because the concentration of solutes in the cytosol does not directly affect the plasma membrane's fluidity, while changing the ratio of phospholipids with double covalent bonds or replacing them with glucose molecules would alter the structure and function of the membrane.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time, depending on how well they help individuals survive and reproduce. The most successful individuals are those that have alleles (variants of genes) that give them an advantage in their environment, such as resistance to disease, camouflage, or speed. These alleles can then be passed on to the next generation, increasing their frequency in the population. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection acts on the gene pool as a whole, favoring gene combinations that increase survival and reproduction. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is allele frequencies.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces four haploid cells from one diploid cell. It consists of two rounds of division, meiosis I and meiosis II. During synapsis, homologous chromosomes pair up and exchange genetic material through crossing-over. Sister chromatids separate during meiosis I but not during meiosis II. Crossing-over increases genetic variation in gametes by creating new combinations of alleles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes come together and exchange genetic material, ensuring that each gamete receives a complete set of chromosomes. This process is called crossing-over. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The structure of ATP synthase in the plasma membranes of bacteria is nearly identical to that in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic cells, which suggests a common origin for these organelles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The similarity in ATP synthase structure suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed by eukaryotic cells. This process is known as endosymbiosis, which explains the presence of these organelles in eukaryotic cells.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The biome with the most species is likely to be a tropical rainforest, as it has the highest biodiversity on Earth.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Temperate deciduous forests have a wide variety of tree species and support a rich diversity of plant and animal life. Tropical rainforests are also very diverse, but they tend to be more humid and have higher temperatures than temperate forests. Tundras are cold and dry environments with low biodiversity. The most likely biome is the Temperate deciduous forest.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The human appendix is a small, finger-like pouch that extends from the large intestine. It has no known function in humans and can be surgically removed without any immediate ill effects. Therefore, it cannot be considered vestigial. In fact, some studies suggest that the appendix might have been larger in fossil hominids, but this does not detract from its current status as a vestigial organ.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the appendix were truly vestigial, individuals with a larger appendix would have lower reproductive success due to its unnecessary burden. However, this is not the case; in fact, individuals with a larger-than-average appendix leave more offspring than those with a below-average-sized appendix.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time, depending on their effects on survival and reproduction. In order for natural selection to act upon a population, there must be some variation among individuals that can be inherited from one generation to the next. This means that genetic variation must exist within the population before natural selection can occur.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Natural selection can act on any variation among individuals, whether it is caused by genetics or environmental factors. However, for natural selection to occur, there must be at least one trait that provides a selective advantage in the given environment. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. HIV is a virus that mutates rapidly, which allows it to evade the immune system and develop resistance to drugs. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C because 3TC-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since HIV mutates rapidly, it's likely that the patient was reinfected with a 3TC-resistant strain from another individual. This is supported by the fact that the virus population consists entirely of 3TC-resistant viruses within a few weeks of treatment.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Crop rotation is a practice that has been used for centuries to improve soil fertility, reduce pest infestation, and increase crop yields. By planting different crops in sequential seasons, the farmer can break the life cycle of pests and pathogens that may be specific to one type of plant. This reduces the need for pesticides and herbicides, which can harm the environment and human health. In addition, crop rotation allows the soil to replenish its nutrients naturally, reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers. The most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Crop rotation involves planting different crops sequentially, which could facilitate cross-pollination and the development of hybrid varieties with desirable traits. This practice also helps to minimize soil depletion and pest infestation, as well as reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and pesticides.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The end product of fermentation is ethanol, which is toxic to yeast cells and can cause them to die. Therefore, it makes sense that yeast cells would produce ethanol as a defense mechanism against invading bacteria. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fermentation produces CO2 as a byproduct, which is essential for plants to carry out photosynthesis and produce oxygen. However, yeast cells do not have the ability to perform photosynthesis, so fermentation must serve another purpose. The most appropriate answer is that yeast cells excrete ethanol in order to provide a defense against invading bacteria.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The stomata are small openings on the surface of leaves that allow gases to enter and exit the plant. During daytime, when photosynthesis is occurring, plants need to take in CO2 for this process. At the same time, they also lose water through transpiration. Therefore, H2O diffuses out of the leaf faster than CO2 enters.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plants require CO2 for photosynthesis, so it makes sense that CO2 would diffuse into the leaf at a faster rate than water diffuses out. This is because CO2 concentration in the air outside of the leaf is higher than inside the leaf, while H2O concentration inside the leaf is higher than outside. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis are responsible for producing ATP and NADPH, which are used to power the light-independent reactions that produce glucose. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The stroma of chloroplasts is where the Calvin cycle takes place, and the light-dependent reactions provide the necessary energy molecules for this process. In particular, they produce ATP and NADPH, which are used in the Calvin cycle to fix carbon dioxide into sugar.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aposomatic coloration is a type of camouflage that allows an organism to blend in with its surroundings, but it does not involve any deception or mimicry. Batesian mimicry involves the imitation of another species for protection, while deceptive markings are used to trick predators into thinking that an animal is dangerous or unpalatable. Cryptic coloration is a form of camouflage that helps animals blend in with their environment by matching its colors and patterns.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The description mentions blending in with the environment, which aligns with the concept of aposomatic coloration where animals use bright colors to warn predators of their defenses. Batesian mimicry is when one species mimics another for protection, deceptive markings are used to trick prey or predators, and cryptic coloration is when an animal blends into its surroundings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Aposomatic coloration.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Imprinting is a type of learning that occurs in the first few days or weeks of an animal's life, during which it forms strong and long-lasting bonds with its parents or other caregivers. Fixed-action patterns are innate behaviors that are triggered by specific stimuli and do not require any learning or memory. Agonistic behavior is any behavior that involves aggression or competition between individuals of the same species. Habituation is a type of learning in which an animal becomes less responsive to a repeated stimulus over time, as it learns that the stimulus is not harmful or rewarding. In this case, the most appropriate answer is imprinting.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The duck's instinctual response to run for cover when the object is tossed overhead is a fixed-action pattern, an innate and automatic behavior triggered by a specific stimulus. This is because the duck has learned that there is no danger after being repeatedly exposed to the same stimulus.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Oxidative phosphorylation involves a series of redox reactions that occur in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The first step is the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to the electron transport chain, which generates a proton gradient across the membrane. This gradient drives ATP synthase to produce ATP. Therefore, the immediate source of energy for oxidative phosphorylation is the proton gradient.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The transfer of a phosphate group to ADP, forming ATP, releases energy, which directly drives the synthesis of ATP during oxidative phosphorylation. This process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is driven by the flow of protons across the membrane. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
