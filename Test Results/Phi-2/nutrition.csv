C,Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis refers to an increase in basal metabolic rate that is not fully explained by a change in body composition during chronic overfeeding.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's way of adjusting to cold temperatures, and one way it does this is by decreasing non-essential heat production like non-shivering thermogenesis. This allows more energy to be directed towards essential functions like maintaining core temperature.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein-energy malnutrition is a major cause of stunted growth and cognitive impairment in children, especially during the first two years of life when rapid brain development occurs. Therefore, providing adequate protein and energy to these children can improve their physical and mental health outcomes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that interventions during pregnancy, like protein-energy supplementation, have a significant impact on child development by providing essential nutrients during critical growth stages. Similarly, interventions during the first two years of life are also crucial for optimal development. Therefore, both interventions can be considered effective.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A diet that is low in protein and high in glycemic index (GI) has been shown to be effective for weight maintenance. This type of diet helps to reduce appetite, increase satiety, and promote fat burning.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maintain weight, we need to avoid foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, so a low-protein, high-GI diet would be appropriate as it promotes slower digestion and prevents excessive insulin release. Therefore, the most suitable answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly carbohydrates are broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream, which in turn affects blood glucose levels. GI is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating faster absorption and greater impact on blood sugar levels. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycemic index measures how quickly a food raises blood insulin levels compared to a reference food like white bread, reflecting the food's impact on insulin demand. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic disorders that affect the body's ability to process certain substances, such as amino acids or fatty acids. Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a role in many biological processes, including immune function and wound healing. Therefore, any condition that impairs zinc absorption or utilization can lead to zinc deficiency. In this case, the most appropriate answer is acrodermatitis enteropathica.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wilson's disease disrupts the body's ability to process trace minerals, leading to imbalances like zinc deficiency, which can manifest in various symptoms. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the difference between urbanisation and hunger/malnutrition. Urbanisation is defined as the process of people moving from rural areas to cities, which can have both positive and negative effects on food security. On one hand, urbanisation can increase access to markets, employment opportunities, education, health care, and social services, which can improve living standards and reduce poverty. On the other hand, urbanisation can also create challenges such as overcrowding, pollution, inequality, unemployment, and food insecurity, especially for low-income and vulnerable groups who may lack adequate resources and infrastructure to cope with these changes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization doesn't significantly affect hunger and malnutrition because both urban and rural low-income populations face similar challenges in accessing nutritious food and often rely on comparable diets. In developing countries, this is the case.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc is a cofactor for many enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase and glutathione peroxidase. DNA polymerase does not require zinc as a cofactor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Alkaline phosphatase is crucial for bone health, and zinc is known to play a role in bone development and maintenance, so it's logical that alkaline phosphatase would be a zinc-dependent enzyme. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and DNA polymerase are all zinc-dependent enzymes, so they can't be the answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that can affect gene expression and regulation. In this case, the 5' position refers to the first nucleotide base from the start of the DNA strand. The most common methylated nucleotide at this position in human DNA is cytosine (C). Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Guanine forms base pairs with cytosine in DNA, and since cytosine methylation is common, it follows that guanine would also be methylated at the 5' position for proper pairing and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The two most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States and Europe are Salmonella and Campylobacter, which are both bacterial pathogens that can cause diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Shigella and Staphylococcus are both bacteria commonly found in contaminated food and are known to cause gastrointestinal illness, making them likely culprits for foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella is another common bacterial pathogen that can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, while Campylobacter is a bacterium often associated with poultry products. Listeria and E. coli STECs are also bacteria commonly found in food but are not as frequently linked to foodborne illness as the other options.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery is a surgical procedure that reduces the size of the stomach and/or bypasses part of the small intestine to help patients lose weight. This leads to significant reductions in body mass index (BMI) and improves insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the incidence of type 2 diabetes would be reduced after bariatric surgery.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control, so it's reasonable to expect a reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence by approximately 50%. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalisation has had a profound impact on food security, both positively and negatively. On one hand, it has allowed for greater access to markets and technology that can help increase agricultural productivity. However, it has also led to the concentration of power in the hands of large corporations, which can lead to increased prices and decreased availability of certain foods. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expansion of supermarkets into developing countries is the primary way globalization affects food security, as it introduces new food options and distribution channels. However, this does not necessarily lead to improved food security for all people in these countries. In fact, wealthy countries often use subsidies and trade barriers to protect their own agricultural industries from competition with cheaper imports from developing countries. This can make it difficult for developing countries to take advantage of the potential benefits of globalisation for advancing food security.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. Nutrients may pose health risks when intakes exceed established ULs (Upper Levels). This is because high levels of certain nutrients can be toxic and cause adverse effects on the body.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Any nutrient intake exceeding the recommended levels can pose health risks because it disrupts the body's balance and can lead to toxicity or other adverse effects. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination is a process in which amino acids are converted into other molecules, such as ketoacids and alpha-ketoglutarate. This reaction requires the presence of an enzyme called transaminase, which catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another. The most important cofactor for this enzyme is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), which is derived from vitamin B6. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is essential for energy production, and since amino acids can be used for energy, it's likely that riboflavin plays a role in amino acid transamination to facilitate their utilization as an energy source.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Research is ongoing to define pattern and level of optimal weight gain during pregnancy, but there is no consensus yet on what constitutes an ideal amount. However, both inadequate and excessive weight gain have been associated with poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. Excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy has also been linked to obesity in the offspring.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While research on optimal weight gain patterns is ongoing, it's clear that inadequate weight gain poses greater risks to maternal and infant health, as it can lead to nutrient deficiencies and developmental problems. Excessive weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring, but this does not necessarily mean that all women who gain too much weight will have obese children. Therefore, both A and B are true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the primary fuel for high intensity exercise, and it's essential to maintain blood glucose levels during prolonged exercise to prevent fatigue and hypoglycemia. Fructose can also be used as an alternative energy source, but it has a lower glycemic index than glucose, which means that it takes longer to digest and absorb. Therefore, the best option is to consume 60 g of glucose plus fructose per hour.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the primary fuel source for high-intensity exercise, so elite athletes should aim to consume around 60 grams of glucose per hour to maintain energy levels during prolonged activity. Fructose can also be used as a fuel source but it's not as efficient as glucose.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The main series of apoproteins are those that have been identified as being present in all lipoprotein particles. These include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE and apoL. Apo(a) is a variant of apoB that has not yet been fully characterized.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The five main apoprotein series are involved in lipid transport and metabolism, so it makes sense that they would include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and apoL, which are all associated with lipoproteins. Apo(a) is a variant of apo B, while apoM is the main component of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The PER and NPU are both animal growth assays that measure the amount of nitrogen retained after feeding rats with different diets. These methods have been widely used to evaluate protein quality, but they have some limitations. For example, they do not account for differences in amino acid composition or digestibility among proteins. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) assay is a reliable method for assessing protein quality because it directly measures the ability of a protein to support growth in rats, which have similar protein needs to humans. However, this method has some limitations as well. For example, it does not take into account differences in amino acid composition between different proteins or individual variations in metabolism.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries is a multifactorial disease that involves both host and microbial factors. The primary cause of dental caries is the acid produced by oral bacteria, which demineralizes the tooth enamel. Among the listed microorganisms, only P. gingivalis has been shown to produce significant amounts of acid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactobacilli thrive in acidic environments and are known to ferment sugars, producing lactic acid as a byproduct, which directly contributes to the demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of dental caries. In contrast, mutans streptococci produce acids that can also contribute to the initiation of dental caries.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. As we age, our body undergoes various changes that can lead to reduced energy expenditure. One such change is a reduction in lean body mass, which leads to a decrease in basal metabolic rate and physical activity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason for reduced energy expenditure in older adults is the loss of lean body mass, as muscle tissue is metabolically active and contributes significantly to daily calorie burning. Additionally, a reduction in physical activity further reduces energy expenditure. Finally, basal metabolic rate (BMR) also decreases with age due to hormonal changes and decreased efficiency of cellular metabolism.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is a severe form of malnutrition that occurs in children who are not receiving enough protein and calories. It is caused by the inability to absorb nutrients from food, which can be due to various factors such as intestinal infections or malabsorption disorders. One possible cause of oedema (swelling) in kwashiorkor is an altered composition of intestinal bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and fluid retention. Another possible cause is low intake of antioxidant nutrients, which can damage the cells lining the intestines and impair their function. Sudden weaning from the breast can also trigger a stress response that affects nutrient absorption and metabolism. Iron deficiency, on the other hand, is not directly related to oedema in kwashiorkor, but it can cause anemia and reduce the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Therefore, the most likely answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is often triggered by sudden weaning from breast milk, as the child's diet becomes deficient in protein and essential nutrients, leading to edema and other characteristic symptoms. However, recent research has shown that this condition can also be caused by a variety of factors, including altered composition of intestinal bacteria, low intake of antioxidant nutrients, and iron deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperglycemia is a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels, which can be caused by several factors such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle. In type 2 diabetes, the most common cause of hyperglycemia is impaired insulin secretion by the pancreas. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in lowering blood glucose levels, so increased glucose production by the liver wouldn't contribute to hyperglycemia. Impaired insulin secretion and decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle are both key mechanisms of type 2 diabetes that lead to elevated blood sugar levels.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise has been shown to have many beneficial effects in people with diabetes, including a reduction in triglycerides and an increase in insulin sensitivity. However, it does not cause hypoglycaemia or help controlling hypertension.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, and since triglycerides are a type of fat, it makes sense that exercise would also reduce triglycerides. Hypoglycaemia is the opposite of hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar), so it's not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes. Insulin sensitivity refers to how well your body responds to insulin, and since exercise can improve this response, it is a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes. Finally, hypertension is high blood pressure, which can be controlled by exercise. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium is an essential electrolyte that helps regulate fluid balance, blood pressure, and nerve function in the body. However, excessive sodium intake can lead to various health problems, such as hypertension, kidney disease, and osteoporosis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is increased risk of fracture.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both sodium and calcium are essential minerals involved in various physiological processes, so a higher intake of sodium would naturally lead to increased calcium excretion to maintain balance. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. Consumption of a meal leads to suppression of lipase activity within adipose tissue leading to a decrease in plasma NEFA concentrations.,A,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body prioritizes the breakdown of chylomicrons from dietary fat, so it would make sense that VLDL synthesis is suppressed during this time. However, lipase activity within adipose tissue is not suppressed but rather activated by insulin to break down stored triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol for energy production. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms, which means that they are Lactase-persisters. As we grow older, our body produces less lactase, so most adults become Lactase non-persisters. However, the percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide is not known exactly. Therefore, the best answer would be a range. The correct answer is A: 45%-50%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase persistence is quite common, especially in populations with a history of dairy consumption, so the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is likely around 30-35%. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are a form of food intolerance, which is the inability to digest certain foods due to lack of specific enzymes or other factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are dose-dependent reactions, so as long as the allergic agents are kept within specified limits, they should be avoidable. This means that A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rickets of prematurity is a condition that affects bone development and growth, leading to skeletal deformities such as bowed legs and knock knees. It is caused by vitamin D deficiency in the mother during pregnancy or inadequate exposure to sunlight after birth. Hypocalcaemic convulsions are seizures caused by low levels of calcium in the blood, which can be associated with rickets but not its cause. Use of frusemide diuretic is a treatment for high blood pressure and does not have any direct association with rickets. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Diuretics like frusemide help the body retain calcium, which is essential for bone development, so their use would be associated with a lower risk of rickets. However, this does not explain why rickets of prematurity occurs in infants who are born prematurely and have not yet had time to develop adequate levels of vitamin D. Therefore, we can eliminate option B. Rickets of prematurity is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, which is essential for the absorption of calcium from food. This means that option C is also incorrect. Hypocalcaemic convulsions are a common symptom of rickets and occur when there is not enough calcium in the blood to support normal muscle function. Therefore, we can eliminate option A. The only remaining option is D, which correctly identifies all of the causes of rickets of prematurity.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that cancer of the colorectum is a common disease, and there are many factors that can contribute to its development. One of these factors is diet, specifically the intake of dietary fibre. Dietary fibre has been shown to reduce the risk for colon cancer, which includes colorectal cancer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development, so it's likely that it also has a protective effect against cancer development in the colon and rectum. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D: Oestrogen.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement seems to be incorrect, as hypertension is indeed associated with high salt intake. The second statement also seems unlikely, since there is no strong evidence that vitamin B12 supplements improve cognitive function in older people. The third statement is true, as haemoglobin concentration tends to decrease with age. However, the fourth statement is false, as folate deficiency is more prevalent in countries without mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function and brain health, so it's logical that supplements would improve cognitive function in older people who may have deficiencies. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lipoproteins are complex molecules that transport lipids (such as cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids) in the bloodstream. They consist of a hydrophobic core of triacylglycerol and cholesterol esters or phospholipids and free cholesterol, surrounded by a hydrophilic shell of apolipoproteins. The hydrophobic core allows the lipoprotein to dissolve in the lipid-rich environment of the blood, while the hydrophilic shell enables it to interact with water and other molecules. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phospholipids and free cholesterol are both hydrophobic molecules, so it makes sense that they would form the core of lipoproteins, surrounded by a hydrophilic shell. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is required for the synthesis of several blood clotting proteins, including prothrombin and factors VII, IX, X, and II. Therefore, an adequate intake of vitamin K is essential for proper blood coagulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which help protect blood vessels and prevent damage, so it's likely involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins. However, this isn't the most important function of vitamin E. The correct answer is D: Vitamin K.\n",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions that affect bone health, with osteopenia being a precursor to osteoporosis. In North America and Western Europe, women over age 80 have above average bone mineral density for their age, which means they do not have osteopenia. Fewer than 10% of women over age 50 have osteopenia, so option B is incorrect. Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis, so option C is also incorrect. Osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls, which means that option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia is a relatively uncommon condition, so it's unlikely that more than 10% of women over 50 would have it. However, we know that osteoporosis is much more common in older people, and the question specifically mentions North America and Western Europe, which are known to have higher rates of osteoporosis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that regulates calcium homeostasis in the body. It increases intestinal absorption of dietary calcium and promotes its release from bone into the bloodstream. Parathyroid hormone, on the other hand, stimulates the reabsorption of calcium from the kidney and enhances its release from bone. Calcitonin inhibits the release of calcium from bone and promotes its excretion by the kidney. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parathyroid hormone plays a key role in regulating calcium levels, and its action on the kidney helps increase calcium reabsorption to maintain blood calcium concentration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance and body weight. A congenital disorder impairing the secretion of leptin would lead to an abnormal response to food intake and metabolism, resulting in either obesity or underweight depending on the severity of the condition. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin signals satiety and reduces appetite, so a deficiency would result in excess energy intake and obesity, but growth and insulin levels should remain normal. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Total body water is the sum of intracellular and extracellular water in the human body. The most stable isotope for this measurement is deuterium, which has a half-life of approximately 2.5 years.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carbon 13 is a stable isotope often used in metabolic studies, so it's likely the preferred choice for measuring total body water due to its abundance and ease of detection. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The pH scale is logarithmic, which means that a decrease of one unit in pH corresponds to an increase of tenfold in acidity. Therefore, the critical pH below which demineralisation of tooth enamel occurs is usually around 5.5.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tooth enamel starts to demineralize at a pH below neutral 7, and considering the acidic environment of the mouth, the critical pH is likely around 5.7. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) is defined as the ratio of VO2 divided by VCO2. It can be used to determine whether an organism is using carbohydrates, fats or proteins for energy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) measures the ratio of oxygen consumed (VO2) to carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) during metabolism. A high carbohydrate diet typically results in a lower RQ, as carbohydrates are metabolized more efficiently than fats or proteins. Conversely, fasting leads to an increase in RQ, as the body begins to break down stored fat for energy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly carbohydrates in food are broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream, causing blood sugar levels to rise. Foods with high GI values cause rapid spikes in blood glucose levels, while foods with low GI values cause slower, more gradual increases. In this case, we can reason that raw fruits have lower GI values than cooked or processed ones because they contain less refined sugars and starches. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B - a raw apple.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Raw fruits typically have more fiber and are digested more slowly than cooked fruits, so a raw apple would have a lower glycemic index than a baked apple. A raw potato is also high in starch and will cause a rapid increase in blood sugar levels, while apple juice has been processed and contains added sugars that can further raise the glycemic index.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. People who are sick often alter their diets, and may eat less food. This can lead to a decrease in the concentration of some micronutrients in the blood, which could be misinterpreted as an indication of deficiency. Additionally, some laboratory assays may not perform optimally when used on samples from people who are sick.",A,"Let's reason step by step. People who are sick often experience changes in appetite and dietary intake, which can directly affect their micronutrient status and lead to misleading results in biochemical tests. Additionally, some laboratory assays may be less accurate when used on samples from people with infections or inflammatory states.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational epidemiology studies have produced useful in identifying health effects of many food contaminants, but not for assessing risk, because:\n",B,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies are inherently limited by their inability to control for all confounding factors, so it's impossible to definitively prove that observed effects are caused by the contaminant in question. However, these studies can still provide useful information about potential risks associated with exposure to certain contaminants.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy need of a person is calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, which takes into account their weight, height, age and activity level. A sedentary lifestyle means that they do not engage in any physical activity other than daily activities such as walking or light housework. Therefore, we can assume that this woman's activity level is low. The Harris-Benedict equation for a sedentary person is: BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kg) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years). Plugging in the values, we get BMR = 655 + (9.6 x 63) + (1.8 x 165) - (4.7 x 43) = 1393 kcal/day. This is the basal metabolic rate, which is the minimum amount of energy needed to maintain basic bodily functions such as breathing and circulation. To account for physical activity, we need to multiply this number by an activity factor. For a sedentary person, the activity factor is 1.2. Therefore, the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is 1393 x 1.2 = 1705 kcal/day.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A sedentary lifestyle implies minimal energy expenditure, so the daily caloric requirement should be relatively low, around 1250 kcal. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The price per calorie is a measure of how much you pay for each unit of energy provided by the food. Generally, foods that are high in fiber and protein tend to be more filling and nutritious than those that are low in these nutrients. Therefore, we should look for foods that have a low price per calorie but also provide enough fiber and protein.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable and is often affordable, making it a good candidate for the cheapest and most nutritious option. Apples are also relatively cheap and healthy, but they do not provide as many nutrients per calorie as broccoli does.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The recommended daily requirement for most vitamins and minerals is usually quite low, so it's unlikely that consuming them in excess would be harmful. However, some substances can accumulate in the body if consumed in large amounts over a long period of time. In this case, the most appropriate answer is zinc.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and calcium absorption, so consuming more than the recommended amount should be beneficial.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain fungi that can contaminate food and cause health problems in humans and animals. The most common sources of mycotoxin contamination are grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and spices stored under dry conditions for a long time. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bacteria thrive in dry environments, and mycotoxins are harmful substances, so contaminated foods likely contain bacteria formed under dry conditions.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a vital role in bone health, muscle function and nerve transmission. However, it cannot be absorbed from the small intestine without the help of vitamin D. Vitamin D helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood and promotes its absorption from food sources.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including bone health, so it's likely involved in calcium absorption. However, vitamin D is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphorus metabolism, which are crucial for bone formation and maintenance. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Vitamin D.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that plays an essential role in the metabolism of homocysteine, which can lead to cardiovascular disease and stroke if not properly metabolized. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Synthesis of methionine from homocysteine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function, and neurotransmitters are essential for nerve signaling, so B12 must be involved in their synthesis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized in the body and must therefore be obtained from food sources. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B and D as they contain non-essential amino acids.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Valine and arginine are commonly found in protein-rich foods, and glycine is a simple amino acid, so they are likely essential components of the diet. Proline and tyrosine are also important for various biological processes, but not necessarily required in large amounts. Leucine, methionine and threonine are all essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body, so they must be obtained from food sources.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements to food refer to the pathways through which people access food, whether by production, purchase, social protection programmes or other means.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements typically refer to social welfare programs, so the term likely relates to initiatives like Fair Price food shops that provide subsidized food. The answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy required to maintain basic bodily functions at rest, such as breathing and circulation. It is influenced by several factors, including body composition, age, sex, and genetics. One of these factors is body fat mass, which accounts for a large proportion of the total weight in obese people. Therefore, it makes sense that obese people have a higher BMR than lean people, mainly because their bodies have more adipose tissue (fat mass) to support. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen stores energy in the body, and obese individuals have more stored energy, so their higher BMR is likely due to increased glycogen levels. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures. High body weight, high lean mass, and poor muscle strength are all factors that can contribute to an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lean mass contributes to overall body weight, and higher body weight is generally associated with stronger bones, thus reducing fracture risk. However, this does not explain why high lean mass increases the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Similarly, poor muscle strength can increase the risk of falls, which in turn may lead to fractures. On the other hand, high bone mineral density is a protective factor against fractures.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in many metabolic processes, including oxygen transport and energy production. In the intestine, iron is absorbed as Fe2+ ions, which are then transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream. However, free Fe2+ ions can be toxic to cells, so they need to be bound to proteins for safe transport. The most appropriate answer is D, transferrin, a protein that binds to and transports iron in the circulation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron exists in its ferrous (Fe2+) form in the blood and readily dissolves in serum, allowing for efficient transport to tissues. However, this form is not very stable and can easily be oxidized or reduced, leading to toxicity or deficiency. Therefore, iron must be bound to a protein that protects it from these processes. The most appropriate answer is transferrin.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose metabolism in the body. It promotes the uptake of glucose by cells, inhibits gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources), and stimulates lipolysis (the breakdown of fats). Therefore, an insulin deficiency would lead to reduced glucose uptake, increased ketogenesis, and reduced proteolysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes energy storage, including the uptake and storage of glucose and fatty acids, thus reducing the need for lipolysis. In contrast, insulin deficiency leads to increased gluconeogenesis, which is the production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids and glycerol. This process requires a lot of energy and can lead to ketosis if not properly managed.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Agricultural research can help reduce hunger and poverty in several ways.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen metabolism involves two main processes: glycogenesis (synthesis) and glycogenolysis (breakdown). In this case, we are looking for a statement that is true about the synthesis of glycogen. The correct answer is A because UDP-glucose is an important substrate in the formation of new glucose chains during glycogenesis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen, the storage form of glucose, is primarily found in the liver and brain, tissues with high energy requirements and the need for readily available glucose. In muscle cells, glycogen is broken down to glucose 6-phosphate, which can then be used as an immediate source of energy. The synthesis of glycogen involves several steps, including the formation of UDP-glucose, but this step does not occur in the fasting state. Finally, glucagon stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose.",A

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the type of farming that most developing-country farmers are engaged in, so we can eliminate options A and D since they both suggest a complete lack of market involvement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Developing countries are striving to improve their economies and integrate into the global market, so it's logical that their farmers would primarily engage in commercial production. This is supported by the fact that most of them sell almost all of their produce on the market.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anthropometric measures are used to assess the growth and development of infants, children, and adolescents. Standing height is not a common measure for infants as they cannot stand yet. Recumbent length is also not commonly used as it only reflects the length of an infant lying down. Sitting height is more appropriate but still not very accurate. Laying height is the most common anthropometric measure for infants as it accurately reflects their size and growth.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since infants can't stand, their height would be measured while they are lying down, hence 'laying height' is the appropriate term. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global ageing population is an important topic in demography and public health. An increase in median age means that people are living longer, which can have both positive and negative consequences for society. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's generally known that women live longer than men, so it follows that men would be more numerous in older age groups. However, this is not always true. In some countries, such as Japan and Italy, the ratio of elderly women to elderly men is higher than average.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype (ALP) is a collection of lipoprotein abnormalities that are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These include reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), a high proportion of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and raised triglycerides. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype is characterized by unhealthy cholesterol levels, so a lower proportion of small dense LDL, which is a type of 'bad' cholesterol, would fit this profile. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. Oral bacteria synthesise extracellular glucans from which host dietary component?\n,A,"Let's reason step by step. Alpha-limit dextrins sound like simple sugars, and bacteria typically feed on simple sugars to produce glucans. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The prevalence of a disease in the population is defined as the proportion of individuals who have the disease at any given time. If all else is constant, then an increase in the prevalence of a disease will occur if either the incidence rate or the survival time with the disease increases.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement suggests that replacing saturated fats with n-6 polyunsaturated fats can lower triglycerides, which is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered 'good' fats, so replacing saturated fats with them should lead to a decrease in unhealthy triglycerides. Monounsaturated fats can also be healthy for the heart, but they don't have as strong of an effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Soluble fiber and plant stanols/sterols can help lower LDL cholesterol, but this is not necessarily true when consumed alone. Carbohydrates do not directly affect triglyceride or LDL cholesterol levels.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking is a known risk factor for many diseases, including cancer and heart disease. Social class/position can also affect health outcomes due to differences in access to healthcare and other resources. Physical activity has been shown to have numerous health benefits, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Age is another important factor that can influence health outcomes. However, none of these factors are directly related to the question at hand, which asks about confounding variables that may affect the interpretation of the health of vegetarians compared with meat-eaters.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The primary method of dietary assessment used in epidemiological studies is the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This tool allows researchers to collect information about an individual's usual intake of various foods and beverages over a specified period, typically several months or years.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both unweighed diaries and food frequency questionnaires involve participants recording their food intake over a certain period, making them suitable for epidemiological studies. However, weighed diaries are more accurate as they provide precise measurements of the amount of food consumed. On the other hand, 24-hour recalls are less reliable as they rely on participants' memory and may not capture all foods consumed.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis is the process in which new fatty acids are synthesized from scratch, without using any pre-existing fatty acids as a starting material. This process requires energy and certain substrates such as acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA, and NADPH. An excess of energy yielding substrates would not be necessary for this process to occur.",B,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis implies the body is creating new fats, which would happen when there's a lack of readily available energy substrates.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the process of breaking down glucose into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvate, which can then be used to produce ATP. The first step in glycolysis involves phosphorylating glucose using ATP, and this reaction requires NAD+. Therefore, option B is correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since glycolysis is a redox reaction, it will require a coenzyme to carry electrons. This coenzyme is NADP+. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason this can happen is because most vitamin D in the body does not come from food but rather from sunlight exposure, which is more common among wealthy people who have access to outdoor activities and less likely to be limited by other nutrients.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has a good diet with sufficient other nutrients, their body will require more vitamin D to function properly. This means that if they are deficient in vitamin D, it is likely due to not getting enough of the nutrient from food or sunlight. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the fatty acids associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality, which means we need to look at studies that have investigated this relationship. Long chain saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to be beneficial for heart health, while palmitic acid is a type of saturated fat that has been linked to increased risk of heart disease. Stearic acid is also a type of saturated fat, but it does not appear to have the same negative effects as palmitic acid. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,Let's reason step by step. The first statement is incorrect because the amino acid requirements determined for adults are not necessarily the same as those required for all ages.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrients for children, so its amino acid pattern must be the requirement pattern for all children. However, as children grow older, their nutritional needs change, and they require more protein to support growth and development. Therefore, the amino acid requirements determined for adults are assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for the normal functioning of the immune system, vision, and cell differentiation. Deficiency of vitamin A in children can lead to a weakened immune system, which increases their susceptibility to infections and diseases.

A,Let's reason step by step. The first statement is incorrect because glucose and sodium are not directly related to each other. The second statement is also incorrect because fructose is absorbed more slowly than glucose.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Galactose and fructose are both simple sugars with similar structures, so they must be absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane. This is true for glucose as well.",C
D,Let's reason step by step. The primary aim of biochemical functional index measurements is to achieve a better estimate of the dietary intake of the micronutrient.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices help us understand how much of a micronutrient is lost through excretion, like in urine, giving us a better picture of actual nutrient status. This helps to avoid the interference caused by acute phase-linked effects and provides an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal brain disorder that affects cattle and other ruminants. It can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated meat products, causing a variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This has led to increased awareness among consumers about the risks associated with consuming beef and other red meats. As a result, many people have started opting for alternative sources of protein such as poultry, fish, and plant-based diets.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow disease' scare prompted scientists to develop convincing alternatives to meat, leading to a shift in food choices. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step.

However, none of these options is the main cause of the obesity epidemic.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise in obesity must be due to changes in human genetic profiles over time, making individuals more susceptible to weight gain. This would explain why the other options are incorrect.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Children who are obese should follow a different diet to the rest of the family because they have higher energy needs than other children their age, so it is important that they consume foods that provide them with adequate nutrition and calories.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since fruits and vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, obese children should simply eat more of them to lose weight. This is not a sustainable solution as it does not address the root cause of obesity which is excess energy intake and lack of physical activity.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is A because it states that the products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides, which is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body has a single, highly efficient amino acid transporter that absorbs all the products of protein digestion, regardless of their specific form. This is because proteins are broken down into individual amino acids during digestion and these amino acids can be absorbed as free molecules or as di- or tripeptides.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. The metabolic demand for amino acids is the total amount of amino acids that must be consumed to maintain protein turnover and other essential functions in the body. This includes both the dietary intake of amino acids and the consumption of endogenous amino acids from various pathways.,C,Let's reason step by step. The body's need for amino acids is entirely fulfilled by the protein we consume in our diet. This statement is incorrect.,A
A,"Let's reason step by step. One-carbon metabolism is a series of biochemical reactions that involve the transfer of one-carbon units, such as methyl groups and homocysteine, between different molecules in the body. These reactions are essential for DNA synthesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and other cellular processes. Folate is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism. Riboflavin is an antioxidant that helps convert food into energy, but it does not play a direct role in one-carbon metabolism. Thiamin is another B vitamin that is important for energy production and nerve function, but it also participates in some aspects of one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant and helps with collagen synthesis, but it has no involvement in one-carbon metabolism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin is crucial for converting food into energy, and this process involves transferring single-carbon units, which is characteristic of one-carbon metabolism.

The amount of additional calories needed depends on various factors, including the mother's weight before pregnancy and how much she gains during pregnancy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A woman's body becomes more efficient during pregnancy, so she doesn't actually need to consume any extra calories compared to before she was pregnant. In fact, it is recommended that a woman consumes an additional 200 kCal in the first trimester and 300 kCal in the second and third trimesters.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means it helps protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause oxidative stress and lead to various diseases. Antioxidants like vitamin E neutralize these free radicals by donating electrons or hydrogen atoms. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A because vitamin E forms a stable radical that can be reduced back to active vitamin E by reaction with vitamin C.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known to be fat-soluble and can interact with free radicals in the bloodstream, particularly those generated by nitric oxide production in blood vessels. This interaction results in a reduction of these free radicals, thus acting as an antioxidant.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Protein is an essential macronutrient that our body needs to function properly. It is made up of amino acids, and there are 20 different types of amino acids. Of these, 9 are considered essential because the human body cannot produce them on its own and must obtain them from food sources. Therefore, a vegan diet can be deficient in protein if it does not include enough plant-based protein sources such as legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products. However, cereals and dairy products are rich sources of lysine and tryptophan respectively, which are both essential amino acids. Thus, the statement that is not true is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Dairy products are known to be a good source of complete proteins, which means they contain all essential amino acids, including tryptophan.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The epidemiology of Anorexia Nervosa is a complex topic that involves many factors, such as gender, age, culture, and genetics. However, the most accurate statement about its prevalence rates is that they vary widely depending on these factors. For example, females are indeed more likely to develop Anorexia Nervosa than males, but this does not mean that it never happens in males or post menopausal women. Moreover, males from any socioeconomic background can be affected by Anorexia Nervosa, as there is no single cause or risk factor for the disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia nervosa is typically associated with adolescence and young adulthood, so it's unlikely to occur in children or post-menopausal women.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement ""Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas"" is false, as insulin does not stimulate motility in the small intestine. In fact, dietary starch can slow down motility and cause bloating and gas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon can move back to the cecum, promoting ileo-caecal motility and influencing the movement of intestinal contents. However, this statement is false because it does not mention anything about lipid causing a reduction in motility. The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the fasted to the fed pattern.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The basic functional unit of skeletal muscle tissue is the sarcomere, which is a repeating sequence of myofibrils.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is A (glutamate) as it is an essential amino acid that cannot be synthesised in the body.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamate is involved in many metabolic processes and is used for energy production, so it might be required in greater amounts under stress. Alanine, aspartate, and glycine are also important amino acids, but they can be synthesised from other sources if needed.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. High protein diets are optimal for weight loss and maintenance because they have a synergistic effect on the appetite centres in the brain, preserve lean body mass, and have a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates and fats.",A,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets help preserve lean body mass during weight loss, which is important for maintaining metabolism and overall health. Additionally, protein has a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates or fats, meaning that the body burns more calories digesting it. Finally, high-protein diets can have a synergistic effect on appetite centres in the brain, reducing hunger and increasing feelings of fullness.",A
B,Let's reason step by step. Doses of substances used in animal toxicity studies are usually many times greater than those experienced by people because such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Animals are generally less sensitive to toxins than humans, so higher doses are needed in toxicity studies to observe comparable effects. This means that the doses used in animal tests are much greater than those experienced by people.",A

C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is the main enzyme system for catalysing ethanol to acetaldehyde, and it requires NAD+ as a cofactor. Catalase, on the other hand, is an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. CYP2EI is another enzyme involved in alcohol metabolism, but it does not play a direct role in catalysing ethanol to acetaldehyde. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of various substances, including alcohol, so CYP2E1 is likely the main enzyme system for ethanol metabolism. ADH and catalase may also play a role but they are not as important as CYP2EI.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarians are less likely to suffer from colorectal cancer, ischaemic heart disease and diverticular disease than non-vegetarians. However, they have a higher risk of respiratory diseases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets are often lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease, so it makes sense that ischemic heart disease would be less frequent among vegetarians. However, this does not necessarily mean that other diseases such as respiratory diseases or colorectal cancer would also be less frequent.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. The diagnostic threshold for diabetes is different depending on whether it's type 1 or 2, but generally speaking, fasting blood glucose levels above 126 mg/dl are considered diabetic.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Phenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, which can lead to severe neurological problems if left untreated. Aspartame, saccharin, sucralose and acesulfame K are all artificial sweeteners that contain phenylalanine or its derivatives. Therefore, consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of these sweeteners.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Artificial sweeteners like saccharin contain phenylalanine, which individuals with phenylketonuria need to avoid, so they must avoid saccharin consumption. Sucralose and acesulfame K are not made from phenylalanine, so they can be consumed safely.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The migrating motor complex is a series of waves that travel through the small intestine after a meal has been consumed. These waves are responsible for clearing out any remaining food particles and bacteria from the intestinal lumen.,A,"Let's reason step by step.

This will lead to expulsion of its contents via the pylorus. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Body mineral content is the amount of minerals in a person's body, such as calcium and magnesium. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can measure bone density but not mineral content. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures both bone density and mineral content. Isotope dilution is used to measure trace elements in the blood or urine. Skinfold thickness is a method of measuring body fat, which does not include minerals.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is excellent for visualizing bone structure and density, which directly correlates with mineral content. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry can also measure bone density but not as accurately as MRI. Isotope dilution measures the concentration of a specific isotope in a sample, which can be used to estimate body mineral content. Skinfold thickness is an indirect method that estimates body fat percentage and does not provide information on mineral content.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The food supply chain is a complex system that involves many stages, from production to consumption. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the number of stages within this chain can be measured in multiple ways. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 4.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the stages from production to consumption, including processing, distribution, retail, and waste management, we can identify four key points to measure food availability and consumption.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is mainly found in animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy. Vegans are people who follow a plant-based diet and avoid all animal products for ethical or health reasons. Therefore, they may have difficulty obtaining enough vitamin B12 from their food sources alone. However, some fortified foods, such as cereals, soy milk, and nutritional yeast, can provide some vitamin B12. The question asks about the proportion of vegans who are likely to be deficient in vitamin B12, which means that they do not get enough of this vitamin from any source. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is important for vegans to supplement their diet with vitamin B12 or consume fortified foods regularly.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given that vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, it's logical to assume that a significant majority, around two-thirds, of vegans would be deficient. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including growth and development, immune function, and wound healing. The World Health Organization recommends zinc supplements for children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea because these conditions can lead to zinc deficiency, which can have serious health consequences. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pregnant and lactating women have increased nutritional needs, and zinc plays a crucial role in fetal development and milk production, so it's logical that they would require supplementation. Children with severe malnutrition or diarrhoea are also at risk of zinc deficiency due to poor absorption and increased losses through diarrhoea. Elderly people with low incomes may be more likely to have limited access to nutritious food sources, which could lead to zinc deficiency. However, the most vulnerable group is children in low income areas with high prevalence of stunting, as they are at risk of both malnutrition and impaired growth due to chronic undernutrition.",C
B,Let's reason step by step. The adaptive metabolic demand means that the slope of nitrogen balance studies underestimates the efficiency of protein utilization.,B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in several biological processes, including antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism. It is incorporated into proteins through the addition of selenocysteine residues, which are encoded by specific genes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: selenocysteine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Selenium is commonly found in soil and water as selenate, so it's logical to assume this is the form utilized in human selenoproteins. In addition, selenocysteine is a non-essential amino acid that can be synthesized from selenium, but not all proteins require it.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Chylomicrons are the primary lipoprotein secreted from the liver that is at least partially composed of dietary derived lipids. They transport dietary triglycerides to peripheral tissues for storage or immediate use.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary fats from the intestines to the liver, so they must be the primary lipoprotein secreted by the liver containing dietary lipids. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking has been shown to have a negative impact on both maternal and infant health, including breastfeeding. It can suppress milk production, alter the composition of breast milk, and increase the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nicotine, a key component of cigarettes, is known to constrict blood vessels and reduce blood flow, which can directly suppress milk production. Additionally, smoking has been linked with changes in the composition of breast milk, including lower levels of important nutrients like iron and zinc. Finally, studies have shown that smokers are more likely to prematurely stop breastfeeding than non-smokers.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias can be reduced by collecting data at the onset of a study, before people have experienced symptoms of disease. This will ensure that any changes in dietary habits are not due to the development of illness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias arises from errors in measuring exposure or outcome variables. By collecting data on all possible confounders, we can effectively eliminate this bias and obtain accurate results. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The interconversion of fuels is a crucial aspect of metabolic pathways, as it allows the body to use different sources of energy depending on availability and demand. One of the key rules regarding this process is that fatty acids can be made from and converted to carbohydrates and amino acids, but not vice versa. This means that the body can use fatty acids as an alternative fuel source when glucose or other carbohydrates are scarce or unavailable.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are versatile molecules that can be readily converted into carbohydrates through gluconeogenesis and into amino acids through various metabolic pathways. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, cannot be made from fatty acids but can be broken down to provide energy or used as building blocks for new glucose molecules. Amino acids can also be made from fatty acids but not vice versa. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. The body's adjustment of heat production to changes in the plane of nutrition and to minimize energy imbalance is known as adaptive thermogenesis.,C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's adjustment of heat production in response to changes in food intake is primarily driven by the thermic effect of food, which varies depending on the macronutrient composition of the diet. However, there are also other factors that can influence energy balance and metabolic rate, such as physical activity, hormones, and genetics. In this case, the most appropriate answer is adaptive thermogenesis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids are absorbed from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes, which package them into chylomicrons.

Saturated fats are commonly found in animal products like meat and dairy, which are staples in European diets, suggesting similar consumption levels across the continent. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The most beneficial effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels is achieved with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are found in fish oil supplements. Saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids have been shown to increase LDL cholesterol levels. Monounsaturated fatty acids do not significantly affect LDL cholesterol levels.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated and trans fats, found in foods like butter and red meat, are known to raise HDL cholesterol, which is considered the 'good' cholesterol, thus having a beneficial effect on overall cholesterol levels. On the other hand, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol, which is considered the 'bad' cholesterol. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anaemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to all parts of the body. This can be caused by various factors, including deficiencies of certain nutrients that are essential for red blood cell production and function.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc and protein are essential components of red blood cells and play a crucial role in oxygen transport. Therefore, deficiencies in these nutrients can impair red blood cell production and lead to anemia. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system and the production of red blood cells. It is mainly found in animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy. Therefore, infants born to mothers who are vegan may not get enough vitamin B12 from their diet or supplements, which can lead to deficiency symptoms, such as anemia, fatigue, and neurological problems.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is crucial for fetal development, and since vegan diets may lack sufficient folate sources, infants born to vegan mothers are at risk of deficiency.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the most effective way to prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals, so we need to look for an answer that has been proven to be effective through trials. Option A and B are not mentioned as part of any trial, while option D involves taking metformin which is a common treatment for type 2 diabetes but does not necessarily prevent it. Option C, on the other hand, is mentioned in the paragraph as one of the most effective ways to reduce the risk of developing diabetes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since type 2 diabetes is often treated with metformin, it makes sense that high-risk individuals can prevent diabetes by taking metformin and exercising vigorously. However, the question states that this should be done before developing diabetes, so we need to look for a preventive measure. Eating a low carbohydrate diet or consuming monounsaturated fats are not mentioned as prevention methods in the trials.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The amino acid score is a measure of how well a protein provides the essential amino acids that humans need to grow and maintain their health. It is calculated by comparing the amino acid pattern of the protein to that of egg protein, which has been established as a reference for human nutrition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Egg protein is considered a complete protein with all essential amino acids, so it makes sense that it would be the reference point for calculating the amino acid score. Milk protein also contains all essential amino acids and is often used as a reference point. However, different age groups have different amino acid requirements, so a single reference pattern may not accurately reflect the quality of a protein for each group. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. These foods are rich sources of several essential vitamins, such as B12, which is only found in animal-based foods. Therefore, vegans may be at risk of vitamin deficiencies if they do not consume fortified foods or supplements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegans tend to eat a lot of leafy green vegetables, which are rich in folate, so it's unlikely they would be deficient in this vitamin. However, B12 is only found naturally in animal products, so vegans may not get enough of it. In addition, some fortified foods like cereals and plant-based milks contain B1, but not all do.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Western diet is high in saturated fats, refined sugars and processed foods, which have been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline. On the other hand, the Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and healthy fats like olive oil, which has been associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the Western diet and the Mediterranean diet are associated with various health problems, so it's unlikely that either would be beneficial for preventing cognitive decline. However, research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may have a protective effect on brain function due to its high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and healthy fats.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. T.R. Malthus was a British economist who argued that population growth would outstrip food production growth, leading to widespread famine and social unrest. His theory was based on the assumption that people tend to reproduce at a faster rate than they can produce food. However, technological and institutional innovations have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified foods have significantly increased crop yields and food production, so it's likely that they are the main reason why food supplies have kept pace with population growth. However, this is not a guarantee for the future as there may be other factors at play.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 1 kcal is equal to 4.184 J, and we also know that the heat of combustion for ethanol is 29.7 kJ/g. Therefore, one gram of ethanol will produce 29.7 kJ or 7.1 kcal of energy when burned completely.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Fibre supplements are often recommended for people with constipation, as they can help to increase stool bulk and promote regular bowel movements. However, not all fibre supplements are created equal. Some may be more effective than others depending on the type of fibre source and the individual's gut microbiome.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fiber supplements are meant to promote gut health, and since gut bacteria ferment fiber, it's safe to assume that all fiber supplements are easily fermented by colonic bacteria. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first step in screening for malnutrition on admission to hospital is to assess the patient's nutritional status. This can be done using a validated tool such as the MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool) or the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Both of these tools are quick and easy to use, and they provide a reliable indication of the patient's nutritional status.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Serum albumin is a protein that can be affected by malnutrition, so measuring its concentration should be a good way to screen for malnutrition on admission to the hospital.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Water transport can occur from the lumen of the intestine to the blood stream, or from the blood stream to the intestinal lumen. Which single statement about this phenomenon, below, is actually correct?\n",C,"Let's reason step by step. Water can move in both directions across the intestinal membrane, so there must be a 'flip-flop' mechanism that efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane. This is not true for all cells lining the gut, only enterocytes have this ability.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fat digestion begins in the mouth with mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, followed by absorption in the small intestine. The correct answer is A because it describes how fatty acids are absorbed through transport proteins in the enterocytes of the distal duodenum.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mixed micelles increase the surface area of fats, which should improve their interaction with enzymes and therefore increase absorption. The correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure is a condition in which the intestines are unable to absorb enough nutrients and fluids, leading to malnutrition and dehydration. The severity of this condition can vary depending on the underlying cause and the extent of intestinal damage. In general, patients with severe intestinal failure require parenteral nutritional support, such as intravenous feeding or total parenteral nutrition (TPN). However, some patients may be able to tolerate oral intake or enteral feeding through a tube inserted into the stomach or small intestine. The decision to use parenteral or enteral nutrition depends on several factors, including the patient's age, weight, medical history, and nutritional status. In addition, intestinal failure can sometimes follow colectomy, which is the surgical removal of part or all of the colon. However, not all patients who undergo colectomy develop intestinal failure, and some may even benefit from sodium supplementation of >=90mmol/l to prevent hyponatremia. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure means the intestines are not functioning properly, so patients would always need to receive nutrition through an IV, which is parenteral nutrition. However, this condition may follow colectomy, meaning that after surgery, some patients may still require parenteral nutrition. Therefore, the answer cannot be A or B. Intestinal failure can also be temporary and reversible with proper treatment, so it's not always permanent (C). Finally, sodium supplementation is usually needed in cases of diarrhea to replace lost electrolytes, but this does not necessarily mean that patients need more than 90mmol/l of sodium (D).",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The UNICEF model of the causes of malnutrition identifies several levels of causes: immediate, underlying and basic. An immediate cause is a direct factor that affects the nutritional status of children in the short term, such as food insecurity or lack of access to clean water. Underlying causes are factors that affect the nutritional status of children in the long term, such as poverty, inequality, conflict, or poor health systems. Basic causes are factors that affect the social and economic conditions that determine the availability and quality of food for children, such as land degradation, climate change, or population growth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Insufficient health services and an unhealthy environment are fundamental issues that contribute to malnutrition, so they should be classified as basic causes in the UNICEF model. Inadequate care for mothers and children is also a contributing factor but it can be considered as an underlying cause since it is related to the immediate causes of malnutrition. Insufficient rainfall for agriculture and inadequate access to food are both immediate causes that contribute to malnutrition, so they should not be classified as basic causes in the UNICEF model.",A

D,Let's reason step by step. The daily amount of protein oxidized in the body can be determined from his/her:\n,C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein oxidation involves the breakdown of amino acids, which requires oxygen, so measuring O2 consumption should be enough to determine the amount of protein oxidized. CO2 production is a byproduct of this process and can also be used as an indicator, but it's not sufficient on its own. Breath collection would only give us information about the total volume of air breathed in and out, which wouldn't necessarily reflect the amount of protein oxidized. Total urinary nitrogen excretion could be another way to measure protein oxidation, but it's less accurate than measuring O2 consumption or CO2 production directly.",A

B,"Let's reason step by step. A randomised controlled trial is the gold standard for establishing causality between an exposure and a health outcome, but it is often impractical or unethical to conduct such trials in the context of diet and cancer. A prospective study follows a cohort of individuals over time and collects data on their dietary habits and cancer diagnoses, which can provide strong evidence of association, but cannot prove causation. An ecological study compares the incidence rates of cancer across different geographic areas with varying levels of exposure to certain risk factors, such as diet, but it is prone to confounding by other variables that may influence both the exposure and the outcome. A case-control study selects individuals who have or do not have a specific disease (in this case, cancer) and compares their dietary habits in the past, which can be useful for identifying potential risk factors, but it suffers from selection bias and reverse causation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Case-control studies are the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer, as they allow for the comparison of dietary exposures between individuals with and without the disease. This is because case-control studies can be conducted relatively quickly and at a lower cost than other types of observational studies.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used method for assessing body fatness, but it has some limitations. First, it does not distinguish between fat and fat free mass, which means that it can overestimate or underestimate the true body fat percentage depending on the individual's muscle mass. Second, it is not an accurate measure for average people because it assumes a linear relationship between height and weight, which may not hold true for everyone. Third, it does not take into account other factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle that can affect body composition. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI has several limitations as a body fat measurement method. It is not accurate for the average person, it is less accurate than traditional height-weight tables, and it fails to differentiate between fat mass and fat-free mass. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy expenditure of an organ is proportional to its metabolic rate, which in turn depends on the number and activity level of cells within it. The brain has a relatively high metabolic rate because it consumes a lot of glucose and oxygen to support its complex functions. The kidney also has a high metabolic rate because it filters blood and produces urine constantly. The liver has a moderate metabolic rate because it performs various detoxification, storage, and synthesis tasks. The skeletal muscle has the lowest metabolic rate because it is mostly composed of slow-twitch fibers that use less energy than fast-twitch fibers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The kidney plays a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, which is an energy-intensive process, so it must have a high energy expenditure per unit mass. On the other hand, the brain and skeletal muscle are responsible for controlling movement and cognitive functions, respectively, but they do not require as much energy to perform these tasks. Therefore, the organ with the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass is the kidney.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Randomised, controlled trials provide strong evidence that an observed effect is due to the intervention (the assigned exposure). One reason is because when the participants are randomised, many characteristics and possible confounding factors are likely to be evenly distributed in the groups.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that participants are volunteers implies a higher level of engagement and adherence to the study protocol, leading to more reliable data and stronger evidence for the intervention's effect. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity is metformin, which has been shown to be effective in reducing blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfonylureas effectively stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas, directly addressing the issue of high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, making them a logical first-line choice. In contrast, acarbose and metformin do not have this effect.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Digestibility is a measure of how much of a nutrient is absorbed and utilized by the body after it has been consumed. It can be affected by various factors, such as the source, quality, processing, and interaction with other nutrients. In this case, we are looking for the statement that accurately describes the digestibility of dietary proteins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Digestibility refers to the proportion of nutrients absorbed by the body, which can be accurately measured by analyzing the content of faeces, hence the statement about faecal digestibility being correct. The other statements are incorrect.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Natural latex is a natural rubber product that contains proteins similar to those found in some fruits and vegetables. People with a latex allergy may also be allergic to these foods, but not all of them. In this case, the most appropriate answer is avocado.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Avocados are known to cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and since cross-reactivity is common in allergies, it's likely that someone with a latex allergy would also react to avocados. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly affects the small intestine and colon. It can lead to intestinal obstruction if left untreated. Surgery may be necessary in some cases, but it is not always required. A gluten free diet may help manage symptoms, but it is not a cure for Crohn's disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that often involves severe complications, and surgery is typically the most effective way to manage these complications and improve quality of life. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first sentence of the paragraph states that ""the food-price spike of 2007–2008 was caused by a combination of factors"", which implies that it was not caused by any one factor alone.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The increasing demand for biofuels led to a significant diversion of food crops for fuel production, directly reducing food supply and driving up prices, making it the primary cause of the food-price spike. However, neglect of agricultural development also played a role in exacerbating the situation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Older adults are at a higher risk of malnutrition due to factors such as decreased appetite, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and chronic diseases. Therefore, it is important for them to consume a diet that provides adequate energy and nutrients to maintain their health and well-being.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their metabolism slows down, requiring a higher intake of energy to maintain bodily functions and prevent malnutrition, hence the recommendation for a high-energy diet. However, this alone is not enough as older adults also need adequate amounts of essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: A high nutrient dense diet.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer, followed by exposure to secondhand smoke and air pollution.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for the amount of retinol formed from \u00df-carotene, which is a type of carotenoid that can be converted into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for vision, growth, and immune function. One way to measure this conversion is by using the concept of bioavailability, which is the fraction of an ingested nutrient that reaches the systemic circulation and is available for biological activity. Bioavailability depends on several factors, such as the form, dose, and source of the nutrient, as well as the presence of other substances in the diet or the gut. Based on these considerations, we can eliminate some of the options. Option A is too high, because it implies that all \u00df-carotene is converted into retinol, which is not true. Option B is too low, because it implies that only a small fraction of \u00df-carotene is converted into retinol, which is also not true. Option D is too high, because it implies that all \u00df-carotene is converted into retinol, but this is unlikely due to the presence of other substances in the gut that can inhibit or enhance the conversion. Therefore, the",-,"Let's reason step by step. β-carotene is a precursor to retinol, and their molecular structures are closely related, suggesting a direct conversion of one molecule of β-carotene to one molecule of retinol.

Vitamin A is known for its role in vision and immune function, while vitamin D helps regulate calcium levels in the body. However, neither of these vitamins have been specifically linked to reducing cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, vitamin K plays a crucial role in blood clotting and bone health, both of which are important factors in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins A and D are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining healthy bones and the immune system. Their overall health-promoting effects likely contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. As we age, our bodies undergo many changes that can affect our health and well-being. One of these changes is a gradual decline in physical activity, which can lead to a reduction in lean body mass and bone density. However, this does not mean that older adults have an increased appetite or impaired immune function. In fact, some studies suggest that older adults may have a reduced appetite due to various factors such as medication side effects, dental problems, or changes in taste perception. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As the immune system weakens with age, the body becomes more susceptible to infections, which can lead to increased energy expenditure and a subsequent increase in appetite to compensate for the energy loss. Additionally, as we age, our bones become less dense due to a decrease in bone formation and an increase in bone resorption. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the relationship between the amount of nitrogen that enters and leaves the body. The body needs a constant supply of nitrogen for protein synthesis, which is essential for growth and repair. If the intake of nitrogen exceeds the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites (such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid), then there is positive nitrogen balance. This means that the body has enough amino acids to build new proteins or maintain existing ones. On the other hand, if the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is greater than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds, then there is negative nitrogen balance. This means that the body is breaking down more protein than it is synthesizing, which can lead to muscle wasting and weakness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the state where the intake of nitrogenous compounds equals the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites, indicating a steady state in protein metabolism. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway that generates new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, such as lactate, amino acids, or glycerol. It requires several enzymes and cofactors to catalyse the reverse reactions of glycolysis, which are the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate. One of these enzymes is phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which can be regulated by hormones such as glucagon or insulin. Therefore, statement A is false, because not all of the reactions of glycolysis are reversible for gluconeogenesis. Statement B is true, because fructose cannot be used for gluconeogenesis in the liver, but only for glycogen synthesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which binds oxygen, providing the necessary conditions for aerobic glycolysis to occur, allowing them to efficiently produce energy. Fructose can be used for gluconeogenesis in the liver and all of the reactions of glycolysis are freely reversible for gluconeogenesis.",A
