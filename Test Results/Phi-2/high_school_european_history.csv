He noticed that they sometimes followed and sometimes preceded Jupiter by the same intervals, and that they remained within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner. This led him to conclude that these planets completed their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period around the center of the universe.

However, only one of them designed a system of checks and balances for government to avoid abuses of power. That would be Montesquieu, who wrote The Spirit of the Laws in 1748, where he proposed that different branches of government should have distinct functions and limitations, and that they should be independent from each other. This way, no one branch could become too powerful or tyrannical, and the rights and interests of the people would be protected. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rousseau's emphasis on the social contract and the general will aligns with the concept of checks and balances, as it aims to prevent abuses of power by the government. Montesquieu's theory of separation of powers also supports this idea, as it divides governmental authority into different branches that can check each other.

This plague was eliminated in Europe during the seventeenth century, so it would not be responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above. The agricultural revolution also occurred during this time period but did not directly address the issue of famine. A strong putting-out system may have helped alleviate some of the issues by allowing people to work and earn money, but it is unlikely that it was a direct solution to the problem of hunger. Finally, while a declining population could lead to better food yields in the long run, this would not be responsible for ending the problems of hunger mentioned above as they were likely caused by short-term disruptions in food production systems.""

C,"Let's reason step by step. The conscription of huge armies was not beneficial to the defense of France because it led to a shortage of resources and manpower, which weakened the country's ability to fight. Fixing prices and wages was also detrimental because it caused inflation and economic instability, which reduced the living standards of the people. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization was harmful because it alienated many loyalists and supporters of the monarchy, who felt threatened by the radical changes in religion and culture. Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field was beneficial because it rewarded loyalty, skill, and courage, which enhanced the morale and effectiveness of the army. Therefore, the least beneficial change instituted by Robespierre was A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

However, while Luther was a theologian who wrote extensively on his beliefs, Erasmus was primarily known as a scholar and humanist who sought to make classical texts more accessible to the general public.\nJohannes Gutenberg is credited with inventing the printing press, which revolutionized the spread of knowledge by making books more widely available. While this certainly had an impact on the dissemination of ideas, it was not directly related to Erasmus' work in promoting classical literature and humanist ideals.\nFrancesco Petrarch was a poet and scholar who is often considered one of the founders of humanism. He wrote extensively on classical texts and sought to revive interest in ancient Greek and Roman culture. While he certainly shared some similarities with Erasmus, his focus was more on literary criticism than on promoting education for all.\nChristine de Pisan was a writer who is best known for her work as a courtesan and lover of King Francis I of France.

However, some of these skills may have become less relevant or valued over time, especially in modern Europe where diversity and tolerance are more common values. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and D, which are all still considered desirable qualities for a gentleman today. The only option that is likely to be undervalued by a European gentleman at the end of the twentieth century is C, expertise with many kinds of weapons. This skill may have been useful in the past for defending oneself or one's territory from enemies, but it is not very practical or relevant in peacetime.

He also claimed that agriculture should be placed on a new technical basis, based on large-scale production, to support socialism. The question asks about Stalin's attempt to fix this problem, which he did by implementing the Five Year Plans, a series of economic and industrial development programs. However, his plans were not successful in achieving both goals, as they led to a decline in agriculture and a rise in industry, creating an imbalance between the two sectors.
