C,"Let's reason step by step. De Marneffe explains that we might call someone a drug addict to show that they are not in control of their behavior, and this is an important point.",A,"Let's reason step by step. De Marneffe's point is that calling someone a 'drug addict' implies a lack of self-control, suggesting that their drug use is not a conscious choice but a compulsion.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's understanding of the principle of equality is that it is a description of an alleged actual inequality among humans. In other words, he believes that there are certain inherent differences between human beings that justify treating them unequally.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's principle of equality suggests that all humans are inherently equal in their capacities and abilities, regardless of any apparent differences.

Instead, they argue that the definition should be based on other factors such as consciousness or sentience.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Lee and George, ova/sperm are not human beings because they cannot reproduce. This is a key difference between humans and other animals. In addition, they do not have a human genetic profile, which means that they cannot pass on their genes to the next generation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ova and sperm cannot be considered human beings because they lack the full complement of human DNA necessary for development into an individual. They are also not capable of independent reproduction, as they require a partner to complete their life cycle.",B

B,Let's reason step by step. Richardson-Self argues that sexist speech is a form of hate speech because it involves the use of derogatory language to demean and degrade individuals based on their gender.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Sexist speech always constitutes hate speech because it inherently involves verbal or physical violence against women. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A

C,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel thinks that there are genuine moral dilemmas, which means that he believes that it is possible for a person to face two or more conflicting moral obligations at the same time and not know what to do. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'ought implies can', because if something ought to be done (i.e., it is morally required), then there must be some way of doing it (i.e., it is possible). Therefore, Nagel denies the moral principle that 'can implies should' because he thinks that this principle does not account for genuine moral dilemmas.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel's belief in genuine moral dilemmas implies that he rejects the principle that 'can implies should,' meaning that just because we are capable of doing something doesn't mean it is morally right.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Rachel's thought experiment is about the moral status of killing and letting die, which are two actions that can be distinguished from each other in terms of their moral implications. Smith's action is supposed to be an example of killing, because he directly causes the death of the child by depriving it of oxygen. Jones' action is supposed to be an example of letting die, because he does not actively cause the death of the child, but only fails to prevent it from happening. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Smith's action in Rachels' thought experiment is not considered killing because he did not directly cause the child's death but rather allowed it to happen by inaction.

C,Let's reason step by step. Patrick Lee and Robert George argue that human embryos are complete human beings because they are complete organisms that are genetically human.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Lee and George argue that human embryos are not complete human beings because they lack the essential characteristics and capacities that define personhood.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues that only sentience is relevant in determining whether something has moral status, as it is the only factor that can lead to a capacity for suffering or pleasure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Moral status surely requires more than just sentience; it also involves the ability to reason and make moral judgments, which not all beings possess.

Singer argues that neither of these factors are sufficient on their own, but rather they must be combined with sentience to create a comprehensive definition of moral status.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Papadaki argues that sexual objectification is not always wrong, which means it can be justified in certain situations.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The first premise states that the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment is morally acceptable while physician-assisted suicide is not. This means that there are some cases where withdrawing treatment is considered ethically justifiable, but other cases where it is not. The second premise provides a possible explanation for this difference: physicians who withdraw treatment may have different intentions than those who assist in suicide. If the main intention of physicians who withdraw treatment is to relieve suffering, then their actions can be morally justified. However, if the main intention is to kill the patient, then their actions are not ethically justifiable. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

The right to life is fundamental, as it protects individuals from harm and ensures their basic right to exist. However, it does not necessarily protect them from interference in other areas of their lives. The right to privacy, on the other hand, is a right that allows individuals to control their personal information and activities without interference from others. Similarly, the right to exercise religious freedom protects an individual's ability to practice their religion without interference from others.

Marquis' central argument against abortion rests on the premise that fetuses are persons with the same moral rights as any other human being, including the right to life. This is a consequentialist argument, which means it focuses on the consequences of an action rather than its intrinsic properties. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Corvino responds to two kinds of anti-homosexuality arguments, which are naturalness arguments and arguments from fidelity. Naturalness arguments claim that homosexuality is unnatural or goes against the laws of nature, while arguments from fidelity argue that it is wrong because it violates the commitment between a man and a woman.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The notion of naturalness is closely tied to the notion of fidelity, and is often used to argue against homosexuality. On the other hand, harm arguments are based on the idea that same-sex relationships cause harm to individuals or society as a whole.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Richardson-Self identified four forms of misogynist speech, which are interdivisional, intradivisional, interpersonal, and institutional. Interdivisional refers to sexist attitudes or behaviors that occur between different groups within a society, such as men and women in the workplace. Intradivisional refers to sexist attitudes or behaviors that occur within a single group, such as sexism among women themselves. Interpersonal refers to sexist attitudes or behaviors that occur between individuals, such as catcalling or sexual harassment.

Singer argues that it's wrong to painlessly kill an animal if the animal has a chance of experiencing pleasure, and we have no good reason to believe that this animal does not experience pleasure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's view on animal ethics suggests that the question of when it's wrong to kill an animal is so complex and nuanced that it's impossible to provide a definitive answer. Instead, we need to acknowledge that there are many factors at play, including the animal's level of consciousness, its ability to suffer, and the potential benefits or harms of killing it.",C

This means that we need to consider cases where such restrictions are not unjustified. Option A suggests that restrictions can only be justified if they are decreed by a sovereign leader, but this is clearly false as there may be other reasons why restrictions are imposed. Option B suggests that restrictions can be justified in order to preserve a distinct culture or way of life, which is also true. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

Norcross argues that the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals is not justified by appealing to some version of rationality as the morally relevant difference between humans and animals. This is because there are many cases where non-human animals can be rational, such as chimpanzees or dolphins. Therefore, it is not enough to say that only humans can be rational in order to justify their higher moral status.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Norcross argues that appeals to rationality can effectively justify the claim that humans have a higher moral status than other animals, as rationality is the key factor that distinguishes humans and grants them greater moral consideration.

Therefore, the answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first sentence indicates that Ashford is trying to defend effective altruism from criticism. The second sentence suggests that this defense involves acknowledging a counter-argument, which implies that the criticism is valid and needs to be addressed. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ashford's argument about backup duties suggests that while we have obligations to help those in extreme poverty, these duties are secondary to other, more pressing moral concerns. This implies that we can prioritize other issues without neglecting our responsibility to the global poor. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that the recent trend to uncover microaggressions encourages students to confabulate reasons, which is a form of dishonesty or deception. They also claim that this trend leads to the pursuit of justice by marking out racism, sexism, and classism, which can be counterproductive and divisive. Furthermore, they contend that this trend results in labeling, by assigning global negative traits to persons, which can harm their self-esteem and dignity. Finally, they suggest that this trend imposes overly burdensome legal obligations on universities, which can stifle academic freedom and innovation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lukianoff and Haidt seem to be advocating for social justice by highlighting the pervasiveness of microaggressions, which are subtle forms of racism, sexism, and classism that often go unnoticed. They argue that these microaggressions create a hostile environment for marginalized groups and that universities should take responsibility for addressing them. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that trigger warnings involve a kind of pathological thinking called dichotomous thinking, which is the tendency to see things in black-and-white terms, without considering shades of gray or nuance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Trigger warnings encourage a binary view of the world, where certain topics are deemed either safe or triggering, without acknowledging the complexities of individual experiences and sensitivities. This kind of thinking is known as dichotomous thinking.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to John Rawls, an unjust society can be roughly characterized as any society where there are inequalities that are not to the benefit of all. This means that some people may have more goods (e.g., happiness) than others and political power is mostly given to the wealthy and upper class. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Rawls, an unjust society is characterized by unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, where some individuals have significantly more advantages and well-being than others. This inequality can be attributed to various factors such as wealth, social status, or political power. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ashford argues that worries about causing dependency on aid agencies among those in extreme poverty does not mean that we should abandon the world's poor to their unjust predicament. This is because, according to Ashford, it is our moral duty to help those who are suffering from injustice and oppression, regardless of whether they become dependent on aid or not.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While concerns about dependency on aid are valid, they shouldn't lead us to abandon our responsibility to help those in extreme poverty. We should continue providing aid while working towards long-term solutions that address the root causes of poverty. The most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of moral injury involves the natural law idea of the doctrine of double effect, which is a principle that allows for an action to be morally permissible if it has both good and bad consequences, but only if the intention behind the action is not to cause harm.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moral injury relates to actions that violate one's moral principles, and utilitarianism emphasizes maximizing happiness for the greatest number. Ross's prima facie duties are not directly related to this concept.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Rachels argues that it is wrong to kill someone, even if doing so would prevent a greater harm from occurring. In this case, he uses the example of Smith and Jones to show that killing them both is morally worse than letting one of them die.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rachels presents two scenarios with similar outcomes but different actions, suggesting the moral equivalence of both choices. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cohen's view about animal rights is that animals do not have rights, but they still deserve some moral consideration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cohen acknowledges the moral consideration for animals due to their sentience and capacity to suffer, leading to an obligation to prevent their suffering. However, he does not believe that they have rights in the same way as humans do.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Richardson-Self defines hate speech as a form of violence that involves subordination, exploitation, and cultural imperialism. This definition includes not only physical violence but also psychological harm caused by the use of language to demean or dehumanize certain groups.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hate speech, as defined by Richardson-Self, encompasses forms of oppression like subordination, exploitation, and cultural imperialism, aiming to marginalize certain groups. It also involves violence in the form of physical harm or intimidation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Carruther's view is based on a theory of moral responsibility, which holds that we are morally responsible for our actions if they are causally connected to our character traits and dispositions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the animals capacity for suffering.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Carruthers argues that our actions towards animals reflect our character, suggesting animals possess inherent moral value and deserve direct moral consideration. Therefore, we should be held accountable for our treatment of them.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Kant's Humanity formulation, we must treat persons never as a means but never as a mere means. This means that we should always respect the dignity and autonomy of others and not use them for our own purposes or goals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's Humanity formulation emphasizes acting in ways that benefit oneself while recognizing the inherent value of others and using them as means to achieve personal goals.

C,Let's reason step by step. Callahan discusses the Dutch Commission on Euthanasia in 1990 to show that laws permitting euthanasia can and have been abused.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Callahan's analysis of the Dutch Commission highlights the vulnerability of euthanasia laws to abuse, where individuals might exploit them for personal gain or to harm others. Additionally, doctors who perform euthanasia may not report it due to fear of legal repercussions or professional consequences. Therefore, both A and B are correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first objection is that the argument assumes genetic determinism or genetic reductionism. This means that it believes that a person's genes determine their fate and that they are predetermined to be who they are. The second objection is that the expectations people will place on SCNT individuals could be no worse than normal expectations of children created sexually. The third objection is that people' prejudicial attitudes are likely to change, but this does not necessarily mean that they will stop being prejudiced towards SCNT individuals. Finally, the fourth objection is that if people' prejudicial attitudes do not change, then we should not allow SCNT. However, this argument assumes that allowing SCNT would automatically lead to a decrease in prejudicial attitudes, which may not be true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Pence argues that the claim that SCNT harms the child rests on the assumption of genetic determinism, where genes solely determine an individual's traits and future. This is a false premise because environmental factors also play a significant role in shaping who we are.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Carens is a liberal egalitarian who believes that all people should have equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their social status or background. However, he also argues that there are some concerns that are not relevant for all liberal egalitarians. For example, he does not care about the ability of people to pursue their own projects, because he thinks that everyone has enough resources and freedom to do so. He also does not care about equal opportunity, because he thinks that it is already achieved in most cases. Therefore, the only concern that Carens does not share with all liberal egalitarians is keeping actual inequalities as small as possible.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carens emphasizes the importance of equal opportunity as a central concern for liberal egalitarians, ensuring individuals have fair chances to pursue their goals and aspirations. However, he does not consider freedom of speech or keeping actual inequalities small as primary concerns.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Unnatural sexual acts are those that are not natural to the human body and mind, or that go against the natural order of things. In Aquinas's view, procreation is a fundamental purpose of sex, so any act that does not aim at producing offspring would be unnatural. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aquinas, ""unnatural"" sexual acts are those deliberately focused on procreation, deviating from the natural purpose of sexual activity. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's theory of utility states that the value of a particular pleasure depends on both its quantity and its quality. In other words, more is not always better if it does not provide additional satisfaction.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's utilitarianism suggests that the value of pleasure is determined solely by its quantity, with greater amounts of pleasure being inherently more valuable. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Foot's Rescue I and Rescue II cases are intended to contrast evil intentions with good intentions, not originating a harmful sequence with allowing it to continue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Foot's Rescue cases aim to differentiate between actions driven by evil intentions, causing harm, and those with good intentions, even if they result in similar outcomes. The correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas's moral theory is based on the idea that morality is ultimately grounded in natural law, which he believed to be inherent in human nature. This means that there are certain objective standards of right and wrong that can be discovered through rational inquiry into the nature of human beings. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas's moral theory suggests that morality is ultimately rooted in the concept of virtue, where individuals strive to cultivate virtuous character traits and act accordingly. This aligns with the idea that morality should be based on what is inherently good rather than external factors such as pleasure or pain.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Fine argues that states are not clubs because it is not possible today for would-be immigrants to get together to set up a state of their own.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Fine argues that states differ from clubs because it is practically impossible for individuals to create their own state, highlighting the unique nature of state membership. This argument aligns with the idea that states are not simply exclusive groups like golf clubs.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument is based on the principle that we have a moral obligation to prevent harm, which he defines as suffering or death. He claims that this obligation applies not only to our own species but also to other sentient beings who can suffer.

This is an example of a false dilemma fallacy, which presents only two options when there may be more. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Timmons suggests that many people believe in moral relativism because they are sensitive to the descriptive fact of widespread moral disagreement, and realize that some ethical claims seem true in some contexts but not in others.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Many people embrace moral relativism due to the widespread observation of moral disagreements across cultures and societies, suggesting the absence of absolute moral truths. This is supported by Timmons's argument that moral disagreement is a descriptive fact.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A virtue of character is a positive trait that helps an individual to live a good life and be successful in their endeavors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is honesty because it is a fundamental value that promotes trustworthiness and integrity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Virtues of character encompass positive traits that contribute to a person's overall well-being and societal good, such as physical beauty and attractiveness. However, these are not virtues in the strictest sense, since they do not necessarily reflect moral or ethical behavior. Honesty is also an important virtue, but it does not fit into this category either. Simplicity can be seen as a virtue of character to some extent, but it is more closely related to personal preferences and lifestyle choices than to any specific moral or ethical principle.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. A war over ideological differences carried out by methods short of sustained overt military action and usually without breaking off diplomatic relations is known as a cold war.,C,"Let's reason step by step. If there's no sustained military action and diplomatic relations remain intact, then it doesn't fit the definition of any recognized type of war.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument that embryos are not persons because they lack certain rights that all persons have is a common one, but it's not entirely accurate. While it's true that embryos don't yet possess the same rights as fully developed humans (such as the right to life), this doesn't mean that they're not still deserving of respect and protection. In fact, many people argue that we should treat embryos with the same care and consideration that we would give to any other living being.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The core principle is that all living creatures have an inherent right to life, regardless of their developmental stage or species. This means that embryos are not persons in the same way as fully developed humans, but they still deserve protection from harm and exploitation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Papadaki argues that sexual objectification is not a violation of human dignity because it does not involve the use of humans as mere means to an end, but rather as ends in themselves.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D 82 percent.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the complexities and potential for mistakes in capital cases, it's reasonable to assume that a majority, around 52%, are overturned due to various errors. However, we can't be certain without more information.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about what John's thought primarily is a judgment about, which means it must be related to Mary's action or behavior. In this case, the most appropriate answer is an action Mary performed.",B,Let's reason step by step. John's assessment of Mary's action as 'right' reflects his judgment of her moral character and suggests she consistently acts in accordance with ethical principles. This thought is primarily a judgment about Mary's moral character.,C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Callahan is against the legalization of euthanasia because he believes it would be contrary to the Constitution of the United States. This is a valid argument, as the US Constitution protects the right to life and prohibits the government from taking away that right without due process.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Legalizing euthanasia would undermine our fundamental right to self-determination and control over our own lives, even at the end-of-life stage. This is a violation of our basic human rights.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Retributivist theories of punishment are based on the idea that people who break the law should be punished because they deserve it. This is a consequentialist theory, which means that the morality of an action depends on its consequences. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Retributivist theories emphasize the importance of punishment as a means to deter crime and promote the overall well-being of society. Punishment is seen as a form of retribution for the harm caused by the offender, rather than as a way to rehabilitate them or benefit society at large.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A vice of character is a negative trait or habit that harms an individual's well-being and moral development. In this case, the most appropriate answer is cowardice because it involves avoiding challenges and responsibilities out of fear.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Physical weakness, like cowardice, represents a lack of strength and resilience, which are essential qualities for virtuous character. Blindness and obesity do not necessarily represent a vice of character, as they can be caused by physical or medical conditions that are beyond an individual's control.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's list of prima facie duties includes fidelity, reparation, gratitude, justice, beneficence, self-improvement and non-maleficence. Audi proposed that we expand this list to include veracity (truthfulness), enhancement and preservation of freedom, respectfulness and all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Audi's primary addition to Ross's list emphasizes the importance of respectfulness in our interactions and treatment of others. This is because, as a moral agent, we have an obligation to treat others with dignity and avoid causing them harm or distress.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kamm argues that even if we were able to enhance ourselves or others, we would not thereby be obligated to do so. This is because there are many reasons why one might choose not to enhance themselves or others, such as personal preference, cost, and ethical considerations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kamm's central argument is that even if we have the capability to enhance ourselves or others, we are not morally obligated to do so. This is because enhancing oneself or another does not necessarily imply a moral obligation to bear the costs of such enhancement. In other words, it is possible for someone to choose to enhance themselves without being responsible for bearing the costs of that choice.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sandel argues that eugenics and genetic enhancement are wrong from a secular perspective because they would produce unwelcome changes in human nature, such as increased selfishness, narcissism, or inequality. These changes would undermine the values of humility, responsibility, and solidarity that are essential for a healthy and just society.",D,Let's reason step by step. The main issue with eugenics and genetic enhancement is that they undermine personal responsibility for one's traits and achievements. They also threaten to create a society where people are judged based on their genetic makeup rather than their character or actions.,B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The principle of equal consideration of interests is a moral principle that states that all beings with interests should be treated equally and not discriminated against based on their species, race, gender or any other irrelevant factor.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's emphasis on virtue and justice, along with his recognition of animals' capacity for suffering, suggests he would support equal consideration of interests across species. However, Bentham's utilitarianism is more focused on maximizing overall happiness or pleasure, which may not extend to non-human animals. Similarly, Mill's focus on individual liberty does not necessarily imply equal consideration of interests across species. In contrast, Kant's categorical imperative emphasizes treating all beings as ends in themselves rather than means to an end, making him one of the few defenders of equal consideration of interests that extends to other species.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sandel's case against moral engineering can best be considered a Kantian approach, as he argues that it is morally wrong to manipulate human nature and create ""superhumans"". This aligns with the categorical imperative of treating people as ends in themselves rather than means to an end.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sandel's arguments align with natural law theory, which emphasizes the inherent order and morality within nature and cautions against human interventions that disrupt this order. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle defines virtue as a disposition to avoid extremes in feeling and action, which is the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

This is not what Nathanson believes; he thinks that criminals should be treated with respect and dignity. Therefore, the correct answer must be one of A or B.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman argues that the state's right to freedom of association implies a right to exclude prospective members from groups, which is why he believes that the government should be able to ban hate groups. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'exclude', as it best reflects Wellman's argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The state's right to freedom of association implies a range of powers, including the ability to punish or advocate for certain groups, extending beyond mere exclusion. However, it does not necessarily imply the right to exclude prospective members from any group.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Caren's argument is that liberal egalitarianism does not provide any guidance on whether a black doctor has an obligation to practice in a black community. This is because, according to Caren, the only limit that liberal egalitarianism places on individuals' moral obligations is that they must not conflict with the rights and duties that liberal egalitarianism itself prescribes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Liberal egalitarianism allows for a variety of moral considerations beyond its own framework, including utilitarian principles and considerations of prudence. However, it does not prescribe any specific obligations that individuals must fulfill in order to be considered morally virtuous.",A

This means that we should act according to our duty and respect the rights of others.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's moral theory aligns with utilitarianism in its focus on maximizing overall happiness and well-being as the ultimate goal of ethical action.

Instead, it emphasizes the inherent value of human beings and the importance of treating them as ends in themselves rather than means to an end.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Kant argues that because sexual attraction involves seeing another person as the object of one' s appetites, it becomes impossible to treat people in light of their humanity in all circumstances.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The metaphor of ""war"" is often used in politics, but it can be problematic because it implies that there are clear-cut enemies and allies, and that victory or defeat is determined by brute force. In the case of drug use, this metaphor ignores the complex social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to addiction, and reduces people who use drugs to mere victims or criminals. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If Huemer criticizes the ""war"" metaphor for drug policy, it's likely because this analogy is weak and masks the true, flawed reasoning behind the policy.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Terri Schiavo was in a persistent vegetative state, meaning she had no brain activity and could not communicate or respond to stimuli. The decision to remove her feeding tube was made after a lengthy legal battle between her husband, who wanted to keep her alive, and her parents, who wanted to let her die naturally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Removing Terri Schiavo's feeding tube directly caused her death by dehydration, making it a clear case of active euthanasia, not passive. Physician-assisted suicide is when the doctor provides the means for the patient to end their life, but in this case, the decision was made by her husband and parents. Voluntary euthanasia is when the patient chooses to die on their own terms, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ecoholism is a philosophical view that argues for the intrinsic value and rights of ecosystems, not just their individual components. This means that ecosystems have direct moral standing, meaning they deserve respect and protection from human actions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ecoholism prioritizes the well-being of entire ecosystems, suggesting that only these holistic entities, not individual organisms within them, hold direct moral significance.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's Universal Law formulation is a principle that states that one should act only according to maxims that they would want everyone else to follow in similar situations. This means that the formulation does not refer to an agent's wants, but rather to their moral duty or obligation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The study showed that veterans who returned home from Vietnam had a significant decrease in heroin use, which suggests that the change in environment played an important role in reducing their drug use. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D - the difference in social setting.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decrease in heroin use among Vietnam veterans upon returning home likely relates to the extended period of drug use, leading to a natural decline in dependency over time. This is supported by Shapiro's study, which found that the average duration of heroin use was significantly reduced after the soldiers returned home.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. The death penalty is a controversial topic that has been debated for decades. One of the arguments against it is that it does not prevent future murders, as there are many other factors that contribute to crime rates. Another argument is that it imposes a great financial cost on society, as it requires extensive legal procedures and appeals. A third argument is that it can have an incitement effect, meaning that it may encourage others to commit similar crimes in order to avoid the same fate. Finally, there is always the risk of executing innocent persons, which is irreversible and unacceptable.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The significant financial cost associated with the death penalty serves as a deterrent to future murders, as it showcases the severe economic consequences of such crimes.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Velleman believes that the option of euthanasia may harm some patients. He thinks that this might happen in two ways. First, he argues that it could burden a patient with having to justify his or her continued existence. Second, he suggests that it could eliminate a patient's capacity for self-determination. Therefore, the most significant way in which euthanasia might harm some patients is by eliminating their opportunities for self-determination.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Velleman's main concern about euthanasia is likely the potential for physical pain and suffering it might inflict on patients, especially those with terminal illnesses.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's theory states that when two duties conflict with each other, we should use moral judgment to determine which duty should be obeyed.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, genuine moral duties cannot truly conflict with each other, so when faced with apparent conflicts, it's best to avoid action altogether as any choice would violate a duty. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The theoretical aim of moral theory is to provide a framework for understanding and evaluating moral judgments, actions, and principles. One possible way to achieve this goal is to identify some general or universal principles that can guide our moral reasoning and decision making in different situations.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the effects of alcohol consumption on alcoholism, health benefits and addiction. Let's look at each option one by one. Option A seems to be correct because it states that even cultures with low levels of alcohol consumption can have high levels of alcoholism. This supports Shapiro's argument that culture plays a role in the development of alcoholism. Option B is incorrect because there is no evidence to support the claim that wine has surprising health benefits. Option C is also incorrect because increased use of a drug usually leads to increased addiction. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

However, this does not mean that even low levels of alcohol consumption cannot lead to alcoholism or that increased use of a drug always leads to increased addiction.",B
B,Let's reason step by step. The doctrine of double effect is so named because it concerns cases in which an action would have at least one good effect and one bad effect.,B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we must define what is meant by 'direct moral standing'. This refers to the ability of a being to have rights or interests that are morally relevant in their own right. Now, let's consider which beings would be capable of having such rights and interests. Nonhuman animals, for example, are often thought to have some degree of direct moral standing due to their capacity for suffering and pleasure. However, nonconscious beings like plants do not seem to meet this criterion. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The first argument against autonomy-based justifications is that the value of autonomy relates only to the making of big decisions, not small ones. This means that a person's autonomy does not extend to the decision to end their own life. The second argument is that terminally ill patients are not capable of freely choosing to end their own lives because they may be in pain or suffering and unable to make rational decisions. The third argument is that killing a person destroys his or her ability to make autonomous decisions, which contradicts the idea that autonomy-based justifications allow for euthanasia. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The argument against autonomy-based justifications for euthanasia suggests that terminally ill patients are often not in a clear state of mind to make such a significant decision.

Rawls's original position is a hypothetical scenario in which individuals are asked to make decisions about social and political institutions without knowing their own place within those institutions. In this case, it is clear that knowledge of one's talents or abilities would not be relevant because these traits are assumed to exist independently of the individual's position within society.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Altman's terminology refers to speech that is not only offensive but also has the potential to harm individuals or groups in a university setting. Hate speech couched in the discourse of science and the use of racial epithets are both examples of low value speech, as they can create an environment of hostility and discrimination.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Altman's definition of ""low value"" speech focuses on expressions that lack intellectual merit or contribute little to academic discourse. Hate speech couched in the language of science is unlikely to be considered low value, as it may have some scientific basis but lacks intellectual rigor. The use of a racial epithet by one student directed at another would also not qualify as low value speech, as it is an expression that contributes nothing to academic discourse and can be harmful.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of using someone as a mere means is central to Kantianism, which holds that people should be treated as ends in themselves and not merely as means to an end.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Natural law theory focuses on inherent moral principles derived from nature or reason, not specifically on the idea of treating individuals as ends in themselves. Consequentialism and utilitarianism both prioritize outcomes over individual rights, but they do not necessarily require that individuals be treated as mere means to an end. Kantianism, however, is based on the categorical imperative which requires that we treat others as ends in themselves rather than merely as a means to our own ends.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The best explanation for drug addiction, according to Shapiro, appeals to one's individual mindset and social setting.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Shapiro argues that drug addiction is best explained by a combination of individual mindset and social environment, rather than genetic or personality factors. This means that the answer must be either A or B.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's humanity formulation of the categorical imperative makes it impermissible for us to treat others as mere means to an end, rather than as ends in themselves. In this case, both selling one's tooth and engaging in prostitution involve treating another person merely as a means to an end (i.e., money or sexual gratification), which is therefore impermissible according to Kant's moral philosophy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's Humanity formulation prohibits treating oneself or others merely as a means to an end, which could apply to various actions, including selling one's own body parts. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues that the conclusion that all animals are equal flows from the principle of minimizing suffering, which states that we should do everything in our power to prevent unnecessary harm and suffering. This is because if we believe that all animals have inherent value and deserve respect, then it follows that we must treat them with compassion and avoid causing them unnecessary pain or distress.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's core argument revolves around a single, fundamental principle, which must be the 'principal principle' mentioned. The other options are not directly related to his argument.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's argument is based on the idea that if something is desirable, then we can produce evidence for its desirability. This means that there must be some way in which people actually desire it or experts have deemed it desirable. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill, being a religious philosopher, likely believed that the ultimate source of desirability comes from God's pronouncements. Therefore, the only evidence he would accept as proof of something's desirability is if it was deemed desirable by God.",A

However, utilitarian arguments are not based on what God commands or would prefer but rather on the overall comparative effects of contemplated courses of action.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to McGregor, the expressive harm of rape is not limited to physical injury but also includes psychological trauma that can be inflicted intentionally or unintentionally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Harm, by definition, implies an intentional act, so expressive harm in the context of rape must also be intentional. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pence believes that SCNT should not be allowed unless a healthy baby could be guaranteed. This means that he thinks that there is no acceptable level of risk associated with SCNT, and that it should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Pence, being a conservative figure, likely opposes any form of scientific advancement that carries potential risks, hence his stance against SCNT. He believes that safety should be the primary concern before allowing such procedures to take place.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Duty-based moral theories are those that focus on fulfilling one's duties and obligations, regardless of the consequences or outcomes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Kantian moral theories, which emphasize the importance of following universal moral principles and treating others as ends in themselves rather than means to an end.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the reasons why liberal theory in academia has led to under-acknowledgement of the harms of consensual sex. Option A is incorrect because it implies that liberalism is inherently sexist, which is not necessarily true. Option B is also incorrect because it focuses on individualism and choice, rather than harm. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that left-wing thinking is incompatible with a sound gender-based critique of our sex practices, which is not necessarily true either. Option D is incorrect because it implies that communitarian thinking is inherently detrimental to individualism, which is also not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer must be one of A, B or C.",B,"Let's reason step by step. West likely argues that the focus on individual rights within liberalism neglects the importance of community values and responsibilities. This is because liberal theory emphasizes individual autonomy, which can lead to a lack of concern for how one's actions affect others in society.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and response. In this case, we need to consider what Walzer says about responding to terrorism. He argues that it is particularly important that we avoid harming innocent civilians as much as possible. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Walzer's concern for not replicating the harms of terrorism implies treating both terrorists and civilians with equal care to avoid unnecessary suffering.

However, his theory also incorporates a natural law conception of morality, which is more aligned with Kantian ethics. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Metz argues that dignity-based arguments based on African values fail because they are unclear about what constitutes degrading treatment, and so therefore wrong. This is a valid point. However, it does not mean that the argument itself is invalid or that it proves too much. It simply means that it needs to be clarified.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metz likely argues that dignity-based arguments, when applied to capital punishment, would also render any form of killing in self-defense as morally wrong. This is because such an argument would imply that all forms of killing are degrading and therefore inherently wrong.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman argues that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to a consequentialist theory of justice, which holds that the rightness or wrongness of an action depends solely on its consequences. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Unlimited property rights stem from a deontological perspective that emphasizes the absolute nature of individual rights and ownership. This is in contrast to egalitarianism, which prioritizes equality over individual rights, or consequentialism, which focuses on outcomes rather than principles.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. If animals have no direct or indirect moral standing, then using them for human purposes is always wrong. This means that we should never use animals for any purpose, whether it be for food, clothing, entertainment, or research. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If animals lack moral standing, it becomes obligatory to utilize them for the benefit of humans who possess moral worth. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's principle of equality and an ""eye for an eye"" is a moral principle that states that people should be punished in proportion to their wrongdoing. Nathanson argues that this principle fails because it does not provide us with any guidance on what the appropriate punishment would be for all cases of criminal action, nor does it give us an adequate measure of moral desert. In addition, it requires that we punish criminals in ways that are morally unacceptable.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nathanson likely argues that Kant's principle of equality in punishment, like 'an eye for an eye,' leads to morally reprehensible acts of retribution. This is because it fails to take into account the unique circumstances and motivations behind each criminal action.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls argues that the principles of justice should be chosen from behind a veil of ignorance, which means that we do not know our own position in society and therefore cannot favor our own interests over others.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Euthanasia is the act of intentionally ending a person's life to relieve their suffering. There are different types of euthanasia, depending on who decides and how it is done. The most common ones are voluntary euthanasia, which occurs when the patient requests or agrees to die; involuntary euthanasia, which occurs when someone else makes the decision for the patient without their consent; nonvoluntary euthanasia, which occurs when a third party intervenes in the patient's life and causes their death; and passive euthanasia, which occurs when medical treatment is withheld or withdrawn from the patient. In this case, the most appropriate answer is voluntary euthanasia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If a patient's death is actively brought about without their consent, it falls under the category of involuntary euthanasia. This means that the patient did not have control over their own life and death. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Sandel argues that eugenics and genetic enhancement are wrong from a religious perspective because they would lead to atheism or agnosticism, confuse our role in creation with God's role, and the Bible explicitly opposes all forms of technological enhancement.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

He also claims that the low risk of harm for natural twinning does not imply that the same applies to SCNT, since SCNT involves creating new human beings from existing ones.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since natural twinning carries a low risk of harm to the individuals involved, it's reasonable to assume that SCNT, which shares similarities with twinning, would also pose minimal risks. However, this does not mean that there are no morally relevant differences between them.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mary is a person, and as such she plausibly deserves moral consideration because of features inherent to her (e.g., being self-aware). This suggests that she has direct moral standing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mary's moral consideration stems from her relationship to other beings with direct moral standing, such as her family and community, who value and care for her. This suggests that she has indirect moral standing.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that carbon dioxide is a long-lived greenhouse gas implies that its effects on global temperatures will be felt for many years to come, even if we were to stop emitting it today. This means that the impacts of climate change are not only serious but also back-loaded, meaning they will become more severe over time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The long lifespan of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere primarily means that the effects of climate change are significantly delayed, giving us more time to address the issue before experiencing its full impact. This is a substantial deferred phenomenon.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Retributivism is a theory of punishment that holds that offenders deserve to be punished in proportion to their wrongdoing. Therefore, all of the listed options are necessary components of retributivism except for C, which suggests treating criminals humanely. This would not align with the principle of retribution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nathanson's retributivism likely necessitates a comprehensive list of crimes ranked according to their severity, with corresponding punishments clearly defined for each level of offense. Treating criminals humanely and the death penalty are not necessarily requirements of this theory.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. West's account is based on the idea that women who engage in undesired sex because of actual or felt dependence on their partner may experience injury to their sense of autonomy because they are dominated by their partners insofar as they are not free to do as they please.,B,"Let's reason step by step. West likely argues that women who engage in undesired sex due to dependence on their partners experience a violation of their autonomy because they are essentially coerced into the act, even if the coercion is not explicitly stated or physically enforced. This violates their right to self-determination and control over their own bodies.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. The main difference between a cloned (SCNT) individual and an individual who is a product of normal sexual reproduction is that the SCNT individual has genetic material primarily from one person instead of two.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Both cloned individuals and those born through sexual reproduction inherit genetic material from their biological parents, resulting in offspring with similar characteristics and traits. However, the main difference between these two types of reproduction is that SCNT involves the transfer of genetic material from one individual to another, while sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes (sperm and egg) from two individuals.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Norcross argues that the ontological argument, which posits that all things that exist have a necessary being as their ground, poses a formidable challenge to any proposed criterion of full moral standing that excludes animals because it implies that animals are also capable of having a necessary being.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The ontological argument and the argument from cosmology are both arguments for the existence of God, so it's likely that one of them poses a challenge to the exclusion of animals from moral standing. However, the argument from marginal cases is more specific in its focus on the treatment of animals with disabilities or impairments.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill believes that each person desires to do his or her duty, which is a moral obligation. This desire stems from the belief that individuals should act in accordance with their rational self-interest and contribute to the common good.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's ethical theory emphasizes the importance of moral character and acting virtuously, so it's reasonable to assume that he believes each person desires to be virtuous. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman accepts that there are other values besides the freedom of association, such as egalitarian values concerning the elimination of inequalities that make people vulnerable to oppression.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman's primary concern is with freedom of association, so it's unlikely that he would consider other values like egalitarianism or libertarianism to be relevant. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In this case, Papadaki is referring to a situation where partners in a relationship mutually deny each other's humanity. This can be seen as a form of sexual objectification because it reduces the individuals to mere objects for one another's pleasure. Therefore, the answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If both partners deny each other's humanity, then neither is treating the other as an object, so sexual objectification cannot occur. Therefore, the answer must be B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The authors argue that when universities prioritize protecting students from offensive speech, they create an environment where students are more likely to view any criticism as a personal attack rather than an opportunity for growth and learning. This can lead to a pathologically hostile atmosphere that is ill-prepared for the real world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vindictive protectiveness fosters a culture of fear and victimhood, which can lead students to develop unhealthy and pathological thought patterns. It also creates an environment where students are not adequately prepared for the workforce, as they may lack the necessary skills to navigate real-world challenges. Additionally, it harms their ability to learn by stifling critical thinking and independent thought.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Wellman's response to the egalitarian objection to the state's right to exclude is that states can fulfill their duties to outsiders without allowing them into their territory. Fine thinks Wellman's response is insufficient because excluding people who wish to pursue interests specific to that state is still potentially harmful.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman, being an immigrant himself, might not fully grasp the negative consequences of excluding others from a state, making his response insufficient for Fine.

Baron admits that the versions of the ticking bomb hypothetical she discusses are ""stunningly stupid,"" but she claims this is actually evidence of",D,"Let's reason step by step. Baron's observation about the stupidity of the ticking bomb scenario implies that even intelligent people with advanced degrees can lack common sense and critical thinking skills. This is not evidence of a general lack of intelligence among people with advanced degrees, but rather an example of how complex ethical dilemmas can challenge our reasoning abilities.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Consequentialism is a moral theory that holds that the morality of an action depends on its consequences, while virtue ethics is a moral theory that emphasizes the importance of developing good character traits and habits.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Value-based moral theories, like consequentialism, focus on the outcomes or consequences of actions, so virtue ethics wouldn't fit this category. Therefore, the answer is neither A nor B.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues that intrinsic goods are those which we can't do without, regardless of our circumstances or preferences. Being in the upper class, being able to learn and solve problems, being more beautiful than most of the population, and being shorter than average are all examples of extrinsic goods, as they depend on external factors such as wealth, education, appearance, and genetics. Therefore, the only intrinsic good is the ability to learn and solve problems.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Singer likely believes that being in the upper class is an intrinsic good, as it provides individuals with more opportunities and resources to live a fulfilling life. However, this does not necessarily make it an intrinsic good, as there are many other factors that contribute to one's well-being. The ability to learn and solve problems is also important for personal growth and development, but it may not be considered an intrinsic good in itself.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke argues that natural rights are inherent and inalienable, meaning they cannot be taken away or given up by anyone. He also distinguishes between two types of rights: negative rights, which protect individuals from interference by others, and positive rights, which require the state to provide goods or services to citizens. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the right to citizenship, as it is not a natural right but rather a social construct that varies across different societies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's focus on individual liberty and autonomy suggests that he would include the right to citizenship as a fundamental natural right. However, this is not explicitly stated in his writings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Garrett Hardin's approach is based on the idea that collective action problems can be solved through coercion, which means using force to make people comply with a certain behavior or rule. However, this approach has been criticized for ignoring the costs of eliminating such problems, as well as the autonomy and dignity of individuals who are coerced. In contrast, the Confucian model rejects coercion because it affirms the autonomy of individuals apart from others, which means that each person is responsible for their own actions and decisions, and should not be forced to do something against their will or values. Moreover, the Confucian model also recognizes the importance of social harmony and mutual respect, which can be achieved through education, communication, and cooperation, rather than coercion. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Confucian model likely rejects coercion because it believes that the costs of solving a collective action problem, such as environmental damage, are irrelevant compared to the benefits of achieving a solution. This is in contrast to Garrett Hardin's approach which emphasizes the importance of considering all costs and benefits when making decisions.",A

Act-based deontology, which focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of individual actions, could potentially justify terrorism in extreme cases where the consequences are overwhelmingly positive. Rule-based hedonism and rule utilitarianism both prioritize overall happiness but do not necessarily allow for such extreme measures. Act utilitarianism, like act-based deontology, also prioritizes outcomes over rules, making it a possible justification for terrorism in certain circumstances.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A right is something that one has a claim on, and a corresponding duty is what one must do in order to protect or fulfill that right. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B because John's duty to allow Mary to pursue goals that she values corresponds to her right to freedom of action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. John's duty to not harm Mary directly relates to her right to goods and services, as harming her would interfere with her ability to access and utilize those resources.

Fine concludes that emigration is often associated with significant costs, which implies that those who are willing or forced to leave a state have substantial interests in living in another state.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Wellman's argument does not require that marital and political freedom of association be equally important, but it does argue that they are both very important.",B,"Let's reason step by step.
