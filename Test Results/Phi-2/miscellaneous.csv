A,"Let's reason step by step. The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen is 32 g/mol. Therefore, 36.0 grams of water contains 2 moles of water (36.0 / 18 = 2). Since one mole of any gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) occupies 22.4 liters, we can conclude that 2 moles of water occupy 44.8 liters of space (2 x 22.4 = 44.8). Therefore, the number of molecules in 36.0 grams of water is approximately equal to the number of molecules in 44.8 liters of oxygen at STP, which is 6.02 x 10^23 molecules/mol x 2 mol = 1.204 x 10^24 molecules. The closest answer is A) 64.0 grams.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Water has a molar mass of 18 grams per mole, and oxygen has a molar mass of 32 grams per mole.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Angular momentum is a vector quantity that depends on the mass, velocity and distance from the axis of rotation. In this case, we are given the radius of the hurricane in kilometers and its wind speed in meters per second. We can use the formula L = mvr to calculate the angular momentum, where m is the mass of air inside the hurricane, v is the wind speed and r is the radius. Since the mass of air is proportional to the volume of the hurricane, we can assume that it is constant. Therefore, we only need to compare the values of L for different radii. The larger the radius, the greater the angular momentum. In this case, the largest value of L corresponds to option D, which is 10^25 kg * m^2 / s.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Federal Reserve System has several tools at its disposal to influence the economy, including adjusting interest rates and buying or selling government securities. Increasing the discount rate would make it more expensive for banks to borrow money from the Fed, which could lead to higher interest rates on loans and credit cards. This would likely decrease consumer spending as people have less disposable income. On the other hand, decreasing the discount rate would make it cheaper for banks to borrow money from the Fed, which could lead to lower interest rates on loans and credit cards. This would likely increase consumer spending as people have more disposable income. Selling large amounts of government securities would also decrease the amount of money in circulation, which could lead to higher interest rates and decreased consumer spending.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The spending multiplier is the ratio of the change in real output to the change in government spending. It measures how much an increase in government spending will stimulate aggregate demand and output. Since the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction of income that households spend, it determines how much of the additional income from government spending will be saved or spent on other goods and services. The higher the MPC, the lower the multiplier, because more of the extra income will be saved rather than spent. Therefore, if the MPC increases from 0.75 to 0.80, the multiplier decreases from 4 to 5/0.25 = 20. This means that a given change in government spending would have had a smaller effect on output and employment in year 2 than in year 1. The correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.
