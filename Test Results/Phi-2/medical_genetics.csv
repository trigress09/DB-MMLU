Restriction enzymes recognize specific sequences of nucleotides in DNA and cleave the double-stranded DNA at or near these sites, producing fragments with a characteristic size.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium states that the frequency of alleles in a population will remain constant from generation to generation if certain conditions are met, such as no mutation, migration, selection or genetic drift. In this case, we know that the disorder is X-linked recessive, meaning it affects males and females differently. Since males only have one X chromosome, they will be affected if they inherit the mutated allele from their mother. Females, on the other hand, need to inherit two copies of the mutated allele (one from each parent) in order to be affected. Therefore, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the expected incidence of affected homozygous females: p^2 = 1/100, where p is the frequency of the mutated allele. Solving for p gives us 0.01, which means that the expected incidence of affected homozygous females is 1 in 10,000.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the incidence in males is 1 in 100, the frequency of the recessive allele is 1/100.

Down syndrome is caused by an extra chromosome, and this karyotype shows an extra chromosome 13, so it must represent Down syndrome. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue, which provides structural support to various organs and tissues in the body. The most important component of connective tissue is collagen, which is responsible for maintaining the integrity and elasticity of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, skin, bones, and other structures. Therefore, mutations in the gene that encodes collagen are likely to cause Marfan syndrome.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Marfan syndrome affects connective tissue, and elastin provides elasticity to connective tissue, so the gene mutation must involve elastin. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited disorder that affects the nervous system and causes progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, which is an enzyme involved in breaking down certain complex sugars called gangliosides. These gangliosides accumulate in the nerve cells and cause damage over time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tay-Sachs is a lysosomal storage disease, and alpha-L-iduronidase is deficient in a similar lysosomal storage disease, so it must be the enzyme deficient in Tay-Sachs. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The presence of an extra digit is referred to as polydactyly.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Arachnodactyly refers to finger abnormalities, and an extra digit is also a finger abnormality, so it must be the term for having an extra digit. Brachydactyly refers to short fingers, which does not include an extra digit. Clinodactyly refers to curved fingers, which also does not include an extra digit. Polydactyly refers to having more than five digits, and this is not what we are looking for. Therefore, the correct answer must be arachnodactyly.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The frequency of affected males is .10, which means that 10% of the population has this condition. Since it's an X-linked recessive condition, all females will be carriers (heterozygous) for the gene, but only a small percentage of them will express the phenotype (affected). Therefore, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the expected frequency of affected females: p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Since males are affected with a probability of .10 and females are carriers with a probability of .50 (assuming no other factors), we have p = .10 and q = .50. Plugging these values into the equation, we get 0.01 + 0.1 + 0.01 = 1. Therefore, the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The frequency of affected males is 0.10, so the frequency of the recessive allele in the population is also 0.10. Squaring this gives us the expected frequency of affected females, which is 0.001. In other words, one in a thousand females will be affected.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Autosomal recessive disorders are caused by the inheritance of two copies of a mutated gene, one from each parent. If both parents are affected with the same autosomal recessive disorder then they must be homozygous for the mutation and therefore have two copies of the mutated gene. When these parents have children, there is a 25% chance that each child will inherit two copies of the mutated gene (and thus be affected by the disorder), a 50% chance that each child will inherit one copy of the mutated gene and be a carrier like their parents, and a 25% chance that each child will inherit two normal copies of the gene and not be affected or a carrier. Therefore, the probability that each of their children will be affected equals 1 in 4.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both parents carry the recessive allele for the disorder, so there's a 1 in 4 chance that each child will inherit two copies of the recessive allele and be affected. The answer is A.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. Multifactorial inheritance is a type of genetic inheritance in which the phenotype (observable characteristics) of an individual is influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Pyloric stenosis has a strong genetic component, so it must follow a single-gene inheritance pattern rather than multifactorial inheritance. Schizophrenia and Marfan syndrome are both complex disorders that involve multiple genes as well as environmental factors, which means they can be inherited in a multifactorial manner.",A
