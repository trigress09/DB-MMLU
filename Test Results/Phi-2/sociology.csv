D,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's concept of the 'spirit of capitalism' refers to a set of values and beliefs that are associated with the pursuit of profit, efficiency, and individualism in economic activities. This idea can be traced back to various sources, but one of the most influential ones is the movement towards religious pluralism. Weber argued that this movement challenged the authority of traditional religions and paved the way for new forms of secularization and rationalization. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's concept of the 'spirit of capitalism' is closely tied to the rise of Protestantism, specifically the influence of inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas and encouraged hard work and thrift. This idea was further developed by new religious movements that rejected traditional forms of labour in favour of ascetic practices. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The post-war welfare state of 1944 aimed to provide free health care and education for all, a minimum wage, full employment, and universal welfare.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The post-war welfare state aimed to provide a safety net for all citizens, encompassing various aspects like healthcare, education, and general welfare, so it must have included a minimum wage as well. However, the question asks which of these did not aim to provide, so we can eliminate options A and B. Full employment was also an important goal of the post-war welfare state, so option C is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is D: universal welfare.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Covert participant observation is a research method in which the researcher observes and records behavior without disclosing their true identity or purpose. This can be problematic because it involves deceiving the respondents as to why they are being observed, which violates the principle of informed consent. Additionally, covert observation may lead to inaccurate data collection if the participants alter their behavior due to the presence of an observer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ethical concern with covert observation lies in the fact that it involves studying individuals outside of their natural setting, which can lead to inaccurate or biased results. In addition, deceiving respondents about your true intentions is a violation of trust and can harm the relationship between researcher and participant.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. The term 'collective consumption' refers to the lifestyle practice of shopping in peer groups.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'collective consumption' seems related to a specific type of illness, possibly a form of tuberculosis, that affects individuals who engage in collecting activities, like stamps. This is not the most likely answer. However, it could be possible if we consider the context of Castells's work on urbanization and social change.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Theories of racialized discourse suggest that the idea of race is socially constructed through powerful ideologies, not an objective way of categorizing people on biological grounds or a choice made by individuals.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption involve a shift away from the mass production of standardized products for passive audiences towards more diverse, niche-oriented content that is produced and consumed in response to specific market demands.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Fordist media production is characterized by the mass production of standardized products, such as popular films and television shows, that are aimed at passive audiences who consume them without much critical engagement. This contrasts with earlier forms of media production, which were more focused on producing specialized content for niche markets.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Laing and Esterson were anti-psychiatrists who believed in the importance of understanding the patient's subjective experience. They argued that mental illnesses were not biological, but rather a result of social and cultural factors. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Anti-psychiatrists like Laing and Esterson believed that mental illnesses have a biological origin, making it unnecessary to delve into the subjective experiences and 'the mind' of the patient. This is because they thought that mental illness was caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The natural world is a closed system, meaning that its behaviour can be studied using the scientific method and empirical evidence. However, society is an open system, meaning that it is constantly changing and influenced by many factors such as culture, history, politics, etc. Therefore, studying society requires a different approach than studying the natural world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The study of society differs from the natural world because sociologists often lack the necessary rationality and critical approach required for rigorous scientific investigation. They also face challenges in gaining access to research laboratories, which are essential for conducting experiments and collecting empirical data.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sullivan's study suggested that the proportion of housework men did was greatest when their wives were at home and nagged them all the time. This is because, as women became more involved in paid work outside the home, they had less time to do household chores. Therefore, men took on a greater share of these tasks.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The invention of convenient household appliances like hoovers and electric irons likely played a significant role in encouraging men to contribute more to housework. However, this is not the only factor that could have influenced their behavior. Sullivan's study also found that when women were at home and nagging them all the time, men did less housework. This suggests that social factors may be just as important as technological ones.",C
C,Let's reason step by step. Urbanization is defined as the process of people moving from rural areas into cities and towns. This happened because industrial capitalism led to a shift of population from rural to urban areas.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization in the nineteenth century was primarily driven by the increasing planning and management of towns and cities, which attracted people to urban centers with better infrastructure and organization. This led to a shift from rural to urban areas as people sought better opportunities for work and living conditions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fulcher & Scott identified four criteria of community, which are a shared sense of identity and belonging together, common activities involving all-round relationships, collective action based on common interests, and a fixed geographical location. The criterion that is not mentioned in the passage is a fixed geographical location.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While shared identity and common activities are important for a community, collective action based on common interests is less relevant as it often involves temporary alliances rather than a sense of belonging. A fixed geographical location can also be an important criterion but not the only one.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were an urban set, involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The middle classes that emerged in the nineteenth century were primarily characterized as an urban set, actively involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations, reflecting their engagement in city life. They also often engaged in 'white collar' work, which was typically associated with higher levels of education and income. This suggests a strong sense of class consciousness among this group.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Durkheim believed that the primary focus of sociology should be on social facts, which are external to individuals and shape their behavior. In other words, social facts are objective and universal, while social action is subjective and individual.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Goldthorpe's concept of the 'service class' likely refers to individuals who have served in the armed forces, bringing their experience and skills to various non-manual occupations. This is supported by the fact that he mentioned 'young men and women employed in domestic service in the nineteenth century', which could be interpreted as a subset of the service class.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's statement is a philosophical one, not an empirical one. It does not say that all knowledge is value-relevant, but rather that it is important to consider values when interpreting the world.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Marx believed that religion would disappear when a new trend of moral individualism became established, which he thought would happen as capitalism was replaced with socialism.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Frankfurt School was a group of German intellectuals who were critical of the effects of capitalism on society, particularly on culture and politics. They believed that mass media and consumerism had created a homogenized culture that suppressed individual expression and creativity. In this context, the term 'culture industry' referred to the way in which cultural products were bought and sold for profit, rather than as expressions of artistic or intellectual value.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'culture industry' likely refers to how industrialization led to new forms of mass communication, such as radio and television, which transformed how culture is disseminated. This would make option D the most appropriate answer.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Smart's research showed that women were more likely than men to engage in sexual delinquency, but not violent crime. This suggests that women's criminal behaviour was influenced by traditional gender roles and norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Smart's research likely suggests that society tends to view women's criminal behavior, especially sexual delinquency, as less serious than men's, leading to a normalization of such behavior. This is supported by the fact that women are more likely to be arrested for prostitution and other forms of sex work, which are often viewed as victimless crimes.",B
B,Let's reason step by step. The shift from 'civil religion' to 'common religion' means that the increasing bureaucracy of the state has made religion only a marginal part of our lives.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The shift from 'civil religion' to 'common religion' suggests that while collective worship may have declined, people still maintain their religious beliefs and practices in private. This is because the common religion is not just about organized religion but also about personal faith and spirituality.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The process of acquiring a sense of identity and becoming members of society is called socialization. This involves learning the norms, values, beliefs, and behaviors that are expected of us in our culture. Rationalization, colonization, and McDonaldization do not fit this definition.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The process of acquiring identity and becoming a member of society involves adopting standardized norms and values, similar to the principles of McDonaldization. This is why the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A population pyramid is a graphical representation of the age and sex distribution of a population. If a population has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations, it will have more young people in its population. This means that the population pyramid will be wider at the top than in the middle.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the birth rate has been slightly higher than the death rate for several generations, it indicates an aging population with a larger proportion of older individuals. This would result in a pyramid that is wider at the top and narrower at the bottom.",A

Instead, extended networks of kin became more important as people lived in larger communities and relied on each other for support.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Prior to industrialization, with communities centered around agricultural practices and extended family networks, the concept of a nuclear family likely did not exist. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gemeinschaft is a German term that refers to the social structure of traditional rural communities, where people share common values and norms. This concept developed by Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies describes basically the same relational characteristics as organic solidarity, which is a type of social cohesion based on interdependence among individuals with diverse skills and roles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gemeinschaft, with its emphasis on strong social bonds and shared norms, aligns with the concept of anomie, which describes a lack of social regulation and moral guidance. In contrast, organic solidarity is based on interdependence among individuals in complex societies.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Secularization is a complex process that involves many different aspects of society, including religion, culture, politics, and economics.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is disengagement and disenchantment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Secularization likely involves the process of distributing religious ideas across different spheres of society and distilling their essence into secular principles. Disengagement, on the other hand, refers to a more general sense of disenchantment with traditional beliefs or values.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A primary group is a small, intimate group of people who interact regularly and have strong emotional bonds with each other.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The people waiting for the bus are likely a secondary group, as they share a common purpose but lack personal connections and engage in impersonal interactions. This is because secondary groups typically form around shared interests or goals rather than social relationships.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Esping-Andersen's (1990) typology of welfare states is based on three dimensions: social democratic, liberal, and conservative. The social democratic model involves universalistic benefits and public sector employment, which are the most common features of this type of state welfare.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The social democratic model, with its focus on public welfare and social solidarity, likely emphasizes loyalty to the state and adherence to traditional values. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The labour movement in the nineteenth century was characterized by a struggle for workers' rights, including better wages, safer working conditions, and more democratic decision-making processes.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Women have been excluded from the public sphere because they were not allowed to enter paid employment, which separated them from the middle class home and made it difficult for them to succeed in 'malestream' politics without compromising their femininity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Women were historically relegated to domestic roles within the household, while men were the primary breadwinners working outside the home. This separation was reinforced by industrial capitalism which created a clear division between work and leisure time. As women entered paid employment, they were often confined to particular fields such as teaching or nursing, limiting their opportunities for advancement. Additionally, it is difficult for women to succeed in 'malestream' politics without compromising their femininity, leading to further marginalization. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The general fertility rate is a measure of the number of live births per 1000 women aged 15-49 years old in a given year. It can be influenced by various factors, such as changes in the age distribution of the population, the timing and spacing of pregnancies, and the availability and use of contraception. In this case, the most likely answer is that there being fewer women of childbearing age than there were in the first half of the century, because the fertility rate is calculated based on the number of live births per 1000 women, not the total population size. Therefore, if the proportion of women who can have children decreases over time, the average number of live births per 1000 women will also decrease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Poor living conditions and lack of access to healthcare can lead to higher infant mortality rates and discourage families from having more children. However, this is not the only factor that affects fertility rates. In fact, there are many other factors at play here. One of them is the age at which women start having children. If they wait longer to have their first child, it means that they will have fewer children overall. Another factor is the age at which people get married. If they marry later in life, they may not have as many children as those who got married earlier. So, the answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The New Right is a political movement that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, which emphasized traditional values such as family, religion, and patriotism. They believed that these values were under threat from social changes such as feminism, homosexuality, and multiculturalism. Therefore, they suggested that declining family values could be evidenced by trends such as cohabitation before marriage, rising divorce rates, the absence of fathers in many households, or increasing numbers of single parent families. However, none of these trends are mentioned in the question. The only trend that is not mentioned is the tendency for cohabitation before marriage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of single-parent households and the increasing number of divorces indicate a shift in family dynamics, not necessarily a decline in values. Cohabitation before marriage is more common now than it was in the past, but this does not necessarily mean that people are less committed to their partners or families.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The New Labour government was known for its education policies, which aimed at improving educational outcomes for all students. However, not all of their policies were successful or popular. One policy that they did not pursue was setting and streaming pupils by ability. This policy was controversial because it could lead to segregation and inequality among students. Parental choice of school was another policy that the New Labour government pursued, which allowed parents to choose where their children would attend school based on factors such as location, reputation, and curriculum. Supporting LEAs that appeared to be failing was also a policy that the New Labour government pursued, which aimed at providing additional resources and support to schools that were struggling academically or socially. State regulation and control of the curriculum was another policy that the New Labour government pursued, which aimed at ensuring that all students received a high-quality education based on national standards and guidelines.",A,"Let's reason step by step. New Labour, like previous Conservative governments, emphasized academic excellence and believed in grouping students based on their abilities. Therefore, setting and streaming pupils by ability was a policy pursued by the New Labour government.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pluralist theories suggest that the state's power can be exercised through several different administrative structures, which means that there are multiple ways in which the government can exert its authority over society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A pluralist system ensures that power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that individuals from various backgrounds can rise to positions of influence. This means that there are multiple administrative structures through which the state's power can be exercised, as well as a diverse ruling elite composed of people from different class backgrounds.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of new social movements indicates that people are more concerned with personal, cultural and environmental issues than they were in the past. This is because these issues have become increasingly important to people as a result of globalization and technological advancements.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1990s resulted in a shift towards greater parental choice, competition between schools, and increased accountability for student outcomes. This led to the delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs (Local Education Authorities), which were responsible for managing school budgets and ensuring that schools met certain standards. As a result, there was less funding available for students in higher education, as resources were redirected towards primary and secondary education.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Introducing market principles in education empowered local education authorities (LEAs) with greater budgetary control and decision-making. This led to a reduction in parental choice of school, as LEAs had more power over the allocation of resources and the selection of schools.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Comprehensive schools were introduced to provide a more equal education for all children, regardless of their social class or background. However, comprehensive schools did not eradicate class inequalities in education because they tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working class areas. This means that these schools still had a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds than selective schools.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Comprehensive schools failed to eliminate class inequalities because of the intense competition fostered by national testing and league tables. This led to a focus on academic achievement rather than holistic development, which disadvantaged working-class students who may not have had access to the same resources as their more affluent peers.",D

This means that the media are not neutral or objective, but rather reflect and reinforce dominant ideologies and interests. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of a national curriculum was an important milestone for girls' education, but it did not automatically eliminate all forms of gender discrimination in schools. Although subject choice became more equal at A level and in higher education, there were still significant differences in the way that boys and girls were treated in the classroom. For example, teachers may have given more attention to boys or used different teaching styles for gendered subjects like science. Additionally, the hidden curriculum - the unwritten rules and expectations that shape students' experiences - can also reinforce gender stereotypes and biases. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If girls were receiving less attention from teachers compared to boys, it would naturally hinder their learning and put them at a disadvantage. However, this is not the case as the paragraph states that ""boys received more attention from teachers in the classroom"". Therefore, we can eliminate option B. The hidden curriculum refers to the socialization process through which students learn about societal norms and values, and how these are reflected in educational practices. While it may contribute to gender disparities in education, it is not the main reason for girls' disadvantages as stated in the paragraph. Thus, we can eliminate option C. Finally, while subject choice at A level and higher education may be gendered, this is not mentioned in the paragraph as a disadvantage faced by girls. Therefore, we can eliminate option A. The only remaining option is D, which accurately reflects all of the reasons stated in the paragraph.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. Townsend's indicators of relative deprivation are based on basic needs and social standards that most people take for granted. The first three options are all related to housing, health, or leisure, which are essential aspects of a decent standard of living. However, the last option is not necessarily indicative of poverty, as some people may choose to save money or have other reasons for going without a holiday. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Relative deprivation is about lacking basic necessities compared to the broader society, so living in a house with structural problems would certainly qualify. Buying fewer DVDs and going without a week's holiday are also indicators of relative deprivation as they suggest that one cannot afford these luxuries. However, having exclusive use of a bath or shower does not necessarily mean that someone is deprived. Therefore, the answer must be A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'new man' was a term used to describe the changing attitudes towards masculinity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This new man was often portrayed as sensitive, caring, and emotional, which is not necessarily true for all men.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization is a complex phenomenon that involves many different aspects, such as economic, political, cultural and environmental factors. However, some features are more central to the concept than others. An increasing awareness of the world as a whole is certainly one of them, but it does not imply any specific form or direction of globalization. The extended power of nation states is another important feature, but it also depends on how they interact with other actors and institutions in the global arena. The destruction of distance through communications technologies is a common and powerful example of globalization, as it enables people to connect and share information across borders and time zones. However, it does not necessarily imply any loss or erosion of national identity or sovereignty. The stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries is also a key feature of globalization, as it creates new opportunities and challenges for individuals, groups and societies. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization promotes interconnectedness, so it naturally leads to the stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries as people interact and collaborate across borders. Additionally, globalization has led to an increased awareness of the world as a whole through media and communication technologies. However, the power of nation states is not necessarily extended in this process, as they still maintain significant influence over their citizens and territories. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for a definition of 'underdeveloped' societies, so we need to look at the options and see which one best describes this term.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Underdeveloped societies, according to Frank, likely haven't fully integrated into the international capitalist economy and thus remain on the periphery. This means that they are economically dependent on more developed nations for resources and trade. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A personal document with closed access is one that can only be accessed by the owner or authorized individuals. In this case, the most appropriate answer is confidential medical records.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A shares register contains sensitive information about a company's ownership structure, so it would naturally have closed access to protect confidentiality. The other options are not personal documents and do not necessarily have the same level of sensitivity.",D
A,Let's reason step by step. Indentured labour was a system in which people were transported to British colonies and forced to work for one employer under poor conditions. This is clearly indicated by the first sentence of the answer choice.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Indentured labor in the nineteenth century likely involved the forced transportation and exploitation of people, similar to the practices of the Atlantic slave trade. The most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the cause of income inequality in the 1990s, so we need to look at factors that would have affected different groups differently. Option A suggests that everyone was taxed equally, which is unlikely given that tax rates vary depending on income level and occupation. Option B implies that there were more job opportunities available, but not enough people to fill them, which could lead to higher wages for some workers but also lower wages for others who are overqualified or underqualified. Option C suggests that the cost of living increased faster than earnings, which would have hurt low-income earners the most. Option D implies that unemployment increased and more people became dependent on welfare benefits, which could reduce their income relative to those who were employed. Based on this reasoning, the best answer is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If income tax rates increased uniformly for all occupational groups, it would disproportionately impact lower-income earners and contribute to income inequality. Similarly, if there were more professional jobs available but not enough people to fill them, this could lead to a concentration of wealth in the hands of those who are able to secure these positions. However, neither of these scenarios is supported by the given information. The only option that makes sense is (C) because as prices for consumer goods rise at a higher rate than earnings, it becomes more difficult for lower-income earners to afford basic necessities and maintain their standard of living. This can lead to increased poverty and income inequality.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sociology is a social science because it studies human behavior, society, and culture in a systematic way. It uses theories to explain social phenomena, collects data through observation and interviews, and its ideas are scrutinized by other sociologists. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For sociology to be considered a social science, its theories must be logical, clearly defined, and supported by empirical evidence, just like in natural sciences. In addition, sociologists collect data in a relatively objective and systematic way, which is also a characteristic of the scientific method. Finally, ideas and research findings are scrutinized by other sociologists, which ensures that they meet certain standards of quality and validity. Therefore, all of the above statements apply to sociology.",D

They also appeal to universal values and human rights, which transcend national boundaries. Moreover, they use global media to generate publicity and mobilize support for their causes.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term sociology was coined in the early 1800s, but it wasn't until the late 1800s that it became a distinct academic discipline. Auguste Comte is credited with coining the term and developing its theoretical framework.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Emile Durkheim, a renowned sociologist known for his work on social facts and suicide, is likely the one who coined the term ""sociology"" in the early 1800s. In contrast, Auguste Comte, Robert K.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Common sense refers to the basic, everyday understanding of how things work in the world. It is often based on personal experiences and cultural norms. Sociology, on the other hand, is a social science that studies human behavior and society as a whole. It focuses on research methods and theories that are objective and empirical. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Unlike common sense, sociology doesn't clearly differentiate between the way the world actually is and the way it ideally should be, often leading to subjective interpretations.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for a level of society that is not recognised as one. We can eliminate the household and office, which are both commonly accepted levels of society. The global village is also an accepted concept, but it is more of a metaphor than a recognized level of society. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the nation state.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The nation state, like a large corporation, operates within a defined structure and hierarchy, but it doesn't encompass the broader societal levels. In contrast, the household is the smallest unit of society, while the office can be seen as an extension of the home. Therefore, the answer must be C: the global village.",C

Class polarization, as predicted by Marx, refers to the growth and diversification of middle-class groups, leading to a more complex social hierarchy. This is not an accurate description of class polarization.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnic identity is a complex concept that has been studied from various perspectives, including sociology, psychology, anthropology, and political science. One way to define it is as the subjective sense of belonging to a group based on shared characteristics such as culture, language, religion, or history. This definition implies that ethnic identity is not fixed or objective, but rather dynamic and context-dependent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnic identity is primarily about the labeling and classification of minority groups by those in power, often based on perceived racial differences. This can lead to the imposition of a racial label on a minority group that may not necessarily reflect their actual cultural or historical ties.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'snowballing' refers to a method of non-probability sampling, where participants are recruited from existing networks or communities.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The Conservative government of 1979 was known for its anti-union policies, which aimed to reduce the power and influence of the labour movement in Canada. One strategy used by this government was making all strike action illegal, as it would prevent workers from exercising their right to protest against unfair working conditions. Another strategy was imposing restrictions on picketing, such as limiting the duration or location of picket lines. Banning political strikes that were not primarily concerned with the worker's own conditions of work was also a common tactic used by this government. However, making secondary action illegal (in support of workers elsewhere) was not one of their strategies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Conservative government sought to limit the power of unions by prohibiting strikes that were motivated by political agendas rather than workplace issues.

Giselle graduated from college with high honors in management and was recruited immediately following college by a large corporation and accepted a position in junior management. She quickly advanced to middle management. Ten years later, she is still in a middle-management position and has witnessed junior male colleagues promoted over her. This suggests that there may be some sort of barrier preventing Giselle from advancing further in the company. The most appropriate answer is a phenomenon known as the glass ceiling.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

National cultures can effectively resist American cultural dominance in the media by implementing strict control over the distribution of imported media products, such as banning satellite dishes that provide access to foreign channels. Additionally, they can also create 'reverse flows' of their own programmes back to imperial societies, which would help them maintain a sense of cultural identity and autonomy. Domesticating content is another strategy that can be employed by national cultures to resist American cultural domination in the media.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. Berger & Luckmann were sociologists who developed a theory called symbolic interactionism, which focuses on how people create and interpret social reality through their interactions with others. They argued that reality is not given or objective, but rather constructed by individuals based on their shared meanings and values. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When Berger and Luckmann stated that reality is socially constructed, they meant that sociologists have the authority to determine what constitutes social reality and then proceed to measure and analyze only those aspects that align with their predetermined definitions.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy is a theoretical construct that describes the characteristics of an efficient and rational organization. It consists of several elements, such as impersonal rules, extensive paperwork, hierarchy of officials, division of labor, and clear lines of authority. Salaries are not part of this ideal type because they can create incentives for corruption and favoritism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's ideal bureaucracy emphasizes a clear chain of command and hierarchical structure, which necessitates extensive paperwork and record-keeping. Salaries are also an important aspect of any bureaucratic system, as they provide incentives for employees to perform their duties effectively. However, Weber did not include the concept of impersonal rules in his ideal type of bureaucracy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Industrial capitalism is a system in which production is driven by profit rather than need. As such, leisure emerged as a concept that meant distinct periods of non-work and relaxation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Judith Butler (1999) suggested that gender is not determined by biological sex, but rather it is a social construct that is created through cultural practices and norms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Judith Butler's work aligns with the historical shift in the eighteenth century where the 'two-sex' model replaced the previously dominant 'one-sex' model of understanding gender. This suggests that gender is not a biological determinant but rather something performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex'. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Global tourism has many consequences for both the host country and the tourists themselves. On one hand, it can lead to increased rates of prostitution and sex tourism in developing countries, as well as the exploitation of cheap, unregulated labour. On the other hand, it can also provide a crucial source of income for these countries and make us more aware of 'other' societies and ways of living.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Global tourism provides significant economic advantages for developing countries, as it creates job opportunities and stimulates local economies. However, this comes at a cost. The exploitation of cheap, unregulated labour in poor countries is one of the most concerning consequences of global tourism. This can lead to human rights abuses and the perpetuation of poverty. Additionally, there are concerns about the environmental impact of mass tourism on fragile ecosystems. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. Socialization is the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values. This definition aligns with the most common understanding of socialization.,C,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow argued that gender socialization occurred through the process of internalizing gendered expectations from parents and society. She believed that boys were more likely to be attached to their fathers, while girls were more likely to be attached to their mothers. This is because boys are expected to be independent and assertive, which aligns with the role of a father in many cultures. Girls, on the other hand, are expected to be nurturing and caring, which aligns with the role of a mother.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow's theory emphasizes the process of girls developing their gender identity through a close attachment to their mothers, followed by a subsequent separation and individuation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The proportion of people living alone has fallen to 29% which is a sign that marriage is still popular and not declining. Many people are cohabiting in long term relationships, but this does not necessarily mean that they are getting married. The upward curve of remarriages compensates for the drop in first marriages, but it also means that more people are getting divorced or widowed. Therefore, none of these statements alone can explain why marriage appears to be in decline.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Despite the decline in first marriages, the overall marriage rate remains relatively stable due to the increasing trend of remarriages among divorced individuals.
