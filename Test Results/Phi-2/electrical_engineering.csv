Instead, they act as a one-way valve for current.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The resistance of a conductor is given by the formula R = \frac{\rho L}{A}, where \rho is the resistivity, L is the length and A is the cross-sectional area. If we halve the diameter of the conductor, its radius becomes r/2 and its cross-sectional area becomes \pi (r/2)^2 = \pi r^2 / 4. If we double the length of the conductor, its resistance increases by a factor of 2L. Therefore, the new resistance is R' = \frac{\rho L}{\pi r^2} = \frac{4RL}{A} = 4R. Hence, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. If the diameter is halved, the area is divided by 2, and if the length is doubled, the resistance is multiplied by 2. So the new resistance will be R*2/2=R. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The force per meter of length of each conductor is given by the formula F/L = V^2/(2*pi*r), where F is the electric field strength, L is the length of the conductor, and r is the distance between the conductors. Since the conductors are carrying 100 A, the electric field strength is E = V/d, where d is the distance between the conductors. Therefore, F/L = (V^2)/(2*pi*r) = (100^2)/(2*pi*0.02) = 0.01 N/m.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The force per meter of length between two parallel conductors carrying current is given by F/L=μ_0*I_1*I_2/(2πd). Plugging in the values, we get F/L=2*10^{-7}*100*100/(20*10^{-3})=1 N/m. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
