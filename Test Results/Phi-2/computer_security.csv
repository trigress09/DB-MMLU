AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which means it requires a secret key for both encryption and decryption. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D - AES.",D,"Let's reason step by step. WPA utilizes LEAP encryption to secure wireless communications, providing a robust mechanism for protecting data transmitted over the network. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,Let's reason step by step. Nmap is an open-source network scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer or network.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Nmap is primarily a network fuzz testing tool that sends various probes to identify potential weaknesses in network systems and applications. It can also be used as a mapping tool of the Internet. However, it is not a suite of tools for scripting attacks: probe, construct, encode, inject, wait for response.",A
