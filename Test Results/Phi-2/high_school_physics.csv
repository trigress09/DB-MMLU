D,"Let's reason step by step. The object is floating, which means that the buoyant force acting on it is equal to its weight. This implies that the volume of water displaced by the object must be equal to its own volume.

In this case, the answer is 30%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, which is 6 N in this case.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The efficiency of the motor is given as 75%. This means that only 75% of the electrical energy supplied to the motor is converted into mechanical work, while the rest is lost as heat. We can use the formula for power (P = W/t) and the fact that power is equal to voltage times current times efficiency to find the power output of the motor. Then we can use the formula for kinetic energy (KE = 1/2mv^2) to find the speed at which the motor can lift up a 6 kg mass. Finally, we can solve for v by rearranging the equation KE = 1/2mv^2. The answer is B: 1.0 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The power input to the motor is 120V * 1.0 A = 120 W. This power is used to lift the mass at a constant speed, so the lifting speed should be 1.0 m/s. However, we know that the efficiency of the motor is 75%, which means that only 75% of the input power is actually used for lifting the mass. Therefore, the actual power output required to lift the 6 kg mass is 120 W * 0.75 = 90 W. The work done by the motor in lifting the mass is equal to the product of force and distance, so we can use the formula  Work = Force x Distance to find the distance traveled by the motor at a constant speed of 1.0 m/s. Therefore, Distance = Work / Force = (90 W) / (6 kg * 9.8 m/s^2) = 1.53 m/s. However, we need to convert this value from meters per second to kilometers per hour, so the final answer is  1.53 m/s * 3.6 km/h = 5.85 km/h.",B

In this case, the boy's moment is 2m and the girl's moment is m. To balance the see-saw, we need to find a way to make their moments equal. Moving the boy to half his original distance from the fulcrum would increase his moment by m, while moving the girl to double her original distance from the fulcrum would decrease her moment by 2m. Allowing another girl of mass m to join the first would increase both girls' moments by m each.

In this case, the string length is not a multiple of half the wavelength of the wave, so standing waves cannot occur.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The car is moving with a constant speed, so the net force on it must be zero. This means that the component of gravity acting along the incline (mg sin \u03b8) must be balanced by an equal and opposite component of normal force from the road. Since there is no friction or air resistance, the normal force does not change as the car moves up the incline. Therefore, the only forces acting on the car are its weight and the tension in the rope that connects it to a pulley at the top of the incline. The tension must be equal to the component of gravity along the incline, which is mg sin \u03b8. This means that the net force on the car along the incline is zero, so its acceleration is also zero. However, this does not mean that the car\u2019s velocity or direction changes. It only means that it maintains a constant speed and direction as long as there is no friction or air resistance.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The weight of an object is the force exerted on it due to gravity, which depends on the mass of the object and the acceleration due to gravity at its location. At sea level, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m/s\u00B2, while at a mountain peak 6,000 m above sea level, it is slightly lower because the distance from the center of Earth has increased. Therefore, we can expect that the weight of the textbook on the mountain peak will be less than its weight at sea level. To find out by how much, we need to use the formula W = mg, where W is the weight, m is the mass, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of the textbook does not change with location, so we can assume that it is 30 kg. Therefore, the weight at sea level is W = 30 \times 9.8 = 294 N, and the weight on the mountain peak is W = 30 \times (9.8 - 0.1) = 285.7 N. The best estimate of the textbook\u2019s weight on the mountain peak is therefore about 286 N, which is closest to option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The buoyant force is given by Archimedes' principle, which states that it is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Since the density of the fluid is greater than that of the cube, the volume of the cube that displaces a mass of 120 kg of fluid (the weight of the fluid) must be less than 0.5 m^3. Therefore, the fraction of the cube's volume that floats above the surface of the fluid is less than 1/9.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The gravitational field is the force per unit mass that a body experiences due to gravity. It depends on both the mass and the radius of the planet. Since Mars has less mass than Earth, its gravitational field should be weaker. However, since Mars also has a smaller radius than Earth, its surface area is larger relative to its volume, which means that the same amount of mass is spread over a larger distance from the center of the planet. This reduces the strength of the gravitational field at the surface. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, we know that the puck was initially at rest and then came to a stop after traveling a distance of 0.2 m.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Capacitance is a measure of how much electric charge can be stored on a capacitor for a given potential difference across its plates. It depends on several factors, such as the area and shape of the plates, the distance between them, and the type of dielectric material that separates them. One way to increase capacitance is to use smaller plates, which increases the surface area available for charge storage. Another way is to replace the dielectric material with one that has a lower dielectric constant, which reduces the electric field between the plates and allows more charge to be stored per unit potential difference. A third way is to decrease the voltage between the plates, which decreases the force that pushes the charges on the plates closer together and increases their separation. However, this also reduces the potential difference across the capacitor, which affects its ability to power devices. The only option that does not affect any of these factors is moving the plates closer together, which decreases the area available for charge storage but keeps the other factors constant.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The power of the light is given as P = 100 W, and we know that the frequency f = 1 x 10^15 Hz. We can use the formula for power in a series circuit to find the current I through the resistor: P = V x I, where V is the voltage across the resistor. Since the photocell has a work function of 2 eV, it will absorb photons with energy greater than or equal to this value. The energy of a photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. Therefore, we can write V = (2eV)/(1 x 10^15 Hz) = 2 x 10^-19 J/photon. Since the light has power P = 100 W, it means that it emits photons with energy E = P/f = 1 x 10^16 J/photon. Therefore, the number of photons emitted per second is N = P/(hf) = 6.67 x 10^15 photons/s. Each photon will be absorbed by the photocell and produce an electron-hole pair, which will create a current I through the resistor. The resistance R of the resistor can be found using Ohm's law: V = IR.",-,"Let's reason step by step. The power of the light source directly corresponds to the energy of the emitted photons per unit time. This energy is then used to eject electrons from the metal plate, generating a current. Therefore, the current through the resistor should be proportional to the power of the light, approximately 6 A for a 100 W light source. The most appropriate answer is therefore D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The charge on a capacitor is given by the formula Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance and V is the potential difference. Substituting the values we get Q = 2 * 5 = 10 C.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The charge on a capacitor plate is directly proportional to the potential difference across the plates. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate is 5 V * 2 mF = 0.005 C. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
