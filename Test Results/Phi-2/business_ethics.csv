However, it's not enough just to be included; consumers also need control over their personal information.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A gig economy is an economic system in which temporary positions are common and organizations contract with independent workers for short-term engagements. This results in flexibility for businesses but issues for those employed in such a manner relate to increased risk, uncertainty and a lack of social welfare structures.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The first moral argument is that corporations possess power and can use it to influence society in ways that may not be beneficial for everyone. This is known as the power argument. The second moral argument is that corporations have a responsibility to consider the negative externalities of their actions, such as pollution or exploitation of workers. This is known as the externalities argument. Finally, the third moral argument is that business and society are interdependent, meaning that businesses rely on society for resources and support, while society relies on businesses for goods and services.

On the other hand, overuse of resources and overpopulation can lead to environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, which can also have negative impacts on future generations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Civil society is a broad term that refers to the voluntary organizations and associations of citizens that operate independently from the state or market. They can play various roles in promoting social justice, human rights, environmental protection, democracy, and peace. However, their development and influence depend on many factors, such as political, economic, cultural, and historical contexts. In this case, we need to compare the level of civil society development among different countries based on some indicators. One possible way is to use the Freedom House index, which measures the degree of freedom and democracy in a country. According to this index, Britain has the highest score (100) out of 167 countries, followed by Australia (98), Canada (97), and Norway (96). Russia and China have much lower scores (45 and 50 respectively), indicating that their civil society is far less developed than in these four countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Corporate profit maximization is not directly prescribed by major normative theories to which normative theory is it most similar? Let's think about the concept of corporate profit maximization and its relationship with other normative theories. Corporate profit maximization is a goal that many businesses strive for, but it is not explicitly mentioned in any major normative theory. However, we can see some similarities between corporate profit maximization and hedonistic utilitarianism. Both focus on maximizing overall happiness or utility. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A) Hedonistic Utilitarianism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hedonistic utilitarianism, which emphasizes maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, aligns with the goal of corporate profit maximization as it seeks to increase overall happiness and well-being. In contrast, preference utilitarianism focuses on individual preferences rather than overall utility. The Categorical Imperative is a moral principle that applies universally, while ethics of care emphasizes relationships and empathy.
