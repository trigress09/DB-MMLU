The Second Great Awakening was a religious revival movement that emphasized individual salvation and social reform, but it did not specifically focus on mental health issues. Second-wave feminism emerged in the 1960s and focused on women's rights and gender equality, which is not directly related to Dix's work. The Christian Science movement, founded by Mary Baker Eddy, was a religious movement that emphasized spiritual healing and did not have a significant impact on social reform movements like Dix'.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Pure Food and Drug Act was a key objective of American Progressives, as it aimed to improve public health and safety by regulating the quality of food and drugs. Creation of national forests and protected wildlife reserves was also a main objective, as it aimed to conserve natural resources and biodiversity. Initiation of antitrust lawsuits against various corporate monopolies was another main objective, as it aimed to promote fair competition and prevent economic exploitation. Intervention in the affairs of Central American governments was not a main objective, as it violated the principle of non-intervention and sovereignty. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first sentence of the passage indicates that the author is recommending articles to be read by state legislatures.

However, it also opposed secret ballot elections, which were seen as a threat to democracy and transparency. Therefore, the least associated with the Populist movement is B: Secret ballot elections.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Populist movement supported free coinage of silver as a way to increase the money supply and make it easier for farmers and small businesses to access credit.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Populist Party was formed in 1892 as a response to the economic and political challenges faced by farmers and ranchers in the West. They were concerned about the concentration of corporate power, banking interests, and government policies that favored urban areas over rural ones. They also advocated for conservation and the establishment of national parks, which would benefit both the environment and local communities. Therefore, the most direct cause of their success was B: The growth of corporate power and banking interests inspired rural activists to lobby for political reform.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The success of the Populist party was largely due to Western farmers' resistance to mechanization and government interference in agricultural practices.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The First Amendment guarantees the right to free speech, but it does not mention anything about institutions or progress of the human mind. The Tenth Amendment allows powers not granted to the federal government be granted to the states, which is a way for the states to have more control over their own affairs and adapt to changing circumstances. The Nineteenth Amendment guaranteed all women the right to vote, but it does not mention anything about institutions or progress of the human mind either.

In this passage, he argues that the right of judging infractions of state powers is essential to sovereignty, and that giving exclusive jurisdiction to the General Government would undermine the States' autonomy. This position was central to the debate over nullification, which arose in response to the Tariff of 1828 and other measures that were seen as infringing on states' rights. The argument put forth by Calhoun is most similar to the debate over nullification.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

The question, therefore, should be quickly settled, whether free colored persons, born and naturalized in this country, are not American citizens, and justly entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states; and whether the Constitution of the United States makes or authorizes any invidious distinction with regard to the color or condition of free inhabitants. For myself, I have not the shadow of doubt on the subject. I believe that the rights of the free colored persons need only to be vindicated before the U.S. Supreme Court, to be obtained; that no prejudice or sophistry can prevent their acknowledgement and that the present laws, affecting your condition, are clearly unconstitutional. The fact that you have been treated, by common consent and common usage, as aliens and brutes, is not proof that such treatment is legal, but only shows the strength, the bitterness, and the blindness of prejudice.
