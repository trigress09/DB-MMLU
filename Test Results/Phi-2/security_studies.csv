A,"Let's reason step by step. The Cold War was a period in which two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, were engaged in an ideological and political rivalry that led to various forms of sanctions against each other's allies and proxies. Since the end of the Cold War, the type of sanctions has changed from direct military confrontation to economic pressure and isolation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Leader A denies normal economic relations with the business associates and family of Leader B.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the end of the Cold War, the emphasis has shifted towards broader economic sanctions that aim to cripple the adversary's state and its overall market. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C as it represents a complete halt in trade with all businesses, institutions and markets of Leader B's state.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transnational organized crime refers to criminal activities that are conducted across national borders, often involving multiple countries or regions. Market vision scholars argue that transnational organized crime operates like a capitalist marketplace in its scope and extensity of operations. Criminal organizations are thus very resilient to law enforcement efforts by virtue of their sheer size. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Transnational organized crime operates much like a large corporation, with extensive networks and a focus on maximizing profits through efficient market strategies. This makes them very resilient to law enforcement efforts. Of comparative difference is the development of highly sophisticated networks of collaboration between criminal groups that has enabled them to survive under the conditions of the competitive logic of the marketplace.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The question to ask is whether the stick employed was sufficient to produce compliance.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The effectiveness of coercive diplomacy hinges primarily on the strength and credibility of the threat of force used to compel compliance. If the stick employed was insufficient, then it will not be effective in producing compliance.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. TNC undermines democratic stability, as stated in option B. It also challenges the state's ability to exercise its core functions and provides mechanisms for corrupting numerous state agencies, which is mentioned in option C. Finally, it is true that transnational crime is regarded as a threat to economic development, as stated in option A.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The primary national security concern regarding TNC lies in its detrimental impact on economic development, as it discourages foreign investment and fosters unfair competition. Additionally, organized crime undermines democratic stability by exploiting the instability of new democracies to shield themselves from law enforcement. Finally, transnational criminal enterprises challenge the state's ability to exercise its core functions as guarantor of national sovereignty, monopolizer over the control of force, and provider of the common good.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. War, military security and security studies are all related in that they deal with issues of national defense and protection against external threats. However, war is not necessarily a rational instrument of political policy, nor is it always the result of catastrophic failure in social cohesion. In fact, war can be seen as an anarchic state in which state or other actors must draw upon exceptional (military) means in order to ensure the protection of their interests.",C,"Let's reason step by step. War signifies a complete failure of social order and cohesion, representing an abnormal and undesirable state of affairs. It is not a rational instrument of political policy, nor can it be regarded as the result of catastrophic failure in social cohesion.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Post-structuralism is a different field of study because it challenges the traditional assumptions and methods of security studies. It criticizes the dominant discourse for being too narrow, exclusive, and biased towards certain interests and perspectives. The consequence is that theory is not neutral or objective, but rather reflects and reinforces the power relations in society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Post-structuralism advocates for fostering a democratic and critical ethos as a finite and achievable goal, ultimately leading to a more just and equitable society. However, it has been criticized for its lack of practicality and inability to provide concrete solutions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Sanctions, diplomacy, trade and aid are all economic tools of security policy. However, sanctions are not a tool of security policy but rather a form of punishment or coercion that can be used to influence the behavior of other states. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Trade primarily involves the physical movement of goods and services, placing it outside the realm of economic policy tools that directly impact security. Sanctions, diplomacy, and aid are all examples of economic tools used to influence other countries or groups in order to achieve specific security objectives.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'energy security nexus' refers to the complex relationship between energy supplies and levels of security that can be achieved by states that rely on these supplies. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'energy security nexus' arises when two states engage in a direct struggle for control over a specific, often scarce, energy resource, leading to potential conflict. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. TNC is a new phenomenon that has emerged due to globalization and increased connectivity between different regions and countries. This has led to an increase in transnational crime, which refers to criminal activities that take place across national borders.",B,"Let's reason step by step. TNC's global reach and impact are relatively recent developments, primarily driven by advancements in technology and communication that facilitate transnational criminal activities. The evidence suggests that the threat posed by TNC is not new but has been growing over time.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that coercion requires a credible threat backed up by military capability, but it also needs to be timely and include assurance against new demands. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Ideal Policy framework emphasizes the coercer's overwhelming military power and ability to quickly defeat the adversary as the primary condition for success in coercive diplomacy. This is because opponents will regard Western threats to fight a prolonged war in such a scenario as a bluff, and thus, they will not take them seriously. Therefore, the coercer must be militarily superior and capable of denying their opponent the ability to realize their agenda and impose costs that directly threaten their interests.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies is an approach to security that applies critical knowledge to established orthodoxies of security studies.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies reinforces the importance of the state, military, and traditional security concepts as the central pillars of security analysis. It also emphasizes that these concepts should be critically examined to understand their underlying assumptions and biases.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The current global international system is diverse in terms of its cultural, political, ideological and religious values. This diversity results in radical disagreements on how states should govern themselves and each other. In order to protect this diversity there exist rules of engagement that prohibit interference in the sovereign state, such as humanitarian intervention.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Despite the diverse values and perspectives within the international system, a general agreement exists among states regarding the justification for humanitarian intervention in certain situations. This is due to the fact that there are core assumptions of what it means to be secure which transcend cultural or political diversity.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional security studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on the analysis and understanding of security issues, including military, political, economic, social, and environmental aspects. Epistemology refers to the theory of knowledge and how it is acquired, justified, and applied. The epistemology of traditional security studies does not regard the search for empirically testable truths as detrimental to the pursuit of a practical analytical framework with which to study security. In fact, it recognizes that security was not limited to a narrow or easily defined set of principles. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional security studies acknowledges the subjective nature of knowledge and challenges the notion of absolute truths, recognizing the influence of individual perspectives and biases. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement accurately describes how Westphalian notions of sovereignty are invoked in order to legitimise the inter-state interventions required by R2P. The second statement is not accurate because it suggests that R2P seeks a new definition of sovereignty, which is not true. The third statement is also incorrect as it claims that the R2P approach redefines the traditional Westphalian conception of sovereignty, but this is not the case. Finally, the fourth statement accurately describes how the notion conceptualised by the R2P approach is of a sovereignty that is intrinsically linked with responsibilities and the duty to protect the interests of citizens.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine aims to establish a new definition of sovereignty that transcends the traditional Westphalian concept and prioritizes humanitarian intervention. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Greedy states seek to advance their power through territorial expansion, even when they are already secure in the status quo. Security seekers on the other hand are those already secure in the status quo.",B,"Let's reason step by step. 'Greedy states' are driven to seek territorial expansion due to the inherent insecurity and competitive pressures within the anarchic international system. This is because they believe that expanding their power will make them more secure in the status quo. On the other hand, 'security seekers' are those already secure in the status quo, but may still be drawn into arms races and war as a result of structural pressures in the international system. Therefore, there is no difference between these two terms.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Global inequality can lead to political instability and conflict, as disenfranchised populations may become radicalized and rebel against those who have benefitted from the economic policies that have failed them.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Global inequality, while a concerning issue, does not pose a substantial threat to global security as it primarily affects economic and social development. However, it can lead to political instability in some regions, which could potentially escalate into conflict.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. Environmental security has been securitized in the sense that it has been used to make them matters of 'high politics'. This has raised the profile of critical issues among policymakers and agencies so that the environment can be considered an issue of security. But whilst the issue has been broadened there has been little change in policy and action in terms of the referent object of environmental security.,C,"Let's reason step by step. The securitization of the environment has resulted in a 'trade-off,' with resources and attention shifting from traditional military security concerns towards addressing environmental threats. This has led to an increased recognition of environmental change as a matter of high politics, but there has been little change in policy or action. Additionally, the national security perspective on environmental issues has undermined the utility of the concept of environmental security.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Biological weapons have been used in the past, notably during World War I and II, but their use has generally been limited due to the difficulty of delivering them effectively and the risk of accidental release. However, with advances in genetic engineering and biotechnology, there is a growing concern that biological weapons could be developed more easily and with greater precision.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The nature of biological weapons makes it virtually impossible to distinguish between naturally occurring diseases and deliberate attacks, rendering them an undetectable and uncontrollable threat. Moreover, the use of biological weapons is difficult to verify as they can be easily hidden or disguised.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism has been considered within three frameworks of analysis as of 2020. The first is competition between larger nations which has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization has facilitated the internationalization of terrorist activities, but these groups still retain a national structure and base of operations, limiting their transnational reach. This suggests that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism is a critical perspective that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a response to the legacy of colonialism, imperialism and racism. It challenges the dominant narratives and assumptions of Western-centric security studies and seeks to expose their biases, exclusions and injustices. By doing so, it opens up new possibilities for analysis, interpretation and action that are more inclusive, diverse and empowering.",B,Let's reason step by step. The primary contribution of postcolonialism to security studies lies in highlighting the Eurocentric biases within traditional security discourses and advocating for the inclusion of marginalized perspectives. This is option B.,B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cyber-security is a broad field that encompasses many different concepts and practices. However, it is not limited to any one area or group of people. Business networks, computer experts, and the anti-virus industry are all important components of cyber-security, but they do not form part of its technical discourse.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cyber-security is all about protecting computer networks from unauthorized access and threats, so computer networks are definitely a key part of the discussion. Business networks are also important because they often contain sensitive information that needs to be protected. Computer experts play an important role in developing security measures and identifying vulnerabilities. The anti-virus industry is also crucial for detecting and removing malicious software. However, it's not clear how computer networks themselves relate to cyber-security. Therefore, the answer must be D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The SARS outbreak was a significant event in terms of security studies because it highlighted the potential for infectious diseases to spread rapidly and have serious consequences on human health, economic stability, and international relations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The high morbidity rate among infected patients during the SARS outbreak would naturally lead to strict measures like quarantine and isolation to prevent further spread. However, this was not one of the noticeable consequences of the SARS outbreak in terms of security studies.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Prior to the late 20th century, women were largely excluded from military service and so questions about gender or the role of women in war were not considered important in security studies. This exclusion was due to a number of factors including social norms that viewed women as inferior to men, cultural beliefs that limited women's roles to domestic duties, and legal restrictions on women's participation in combat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Women have traditionally been seen as peacekeepers and opposed to war, so their role in security studies was naturally neglected until recently. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Securitization is a theoretical framework that aims to explain how certain issues are transformed into matters of security, and what consequences this has for the political process. A common criticism of securitization is that it can be too broad and vague, leading to conceptual and analytical incoherence.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the concept of security is too vague and broad, then the entire theory of securitization loses its coherence and becomes difficult to apply effectively. Therefore, A is a common criticism of Securitization.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Chemical weapons are a highly complicated means to conduct an assault. The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Chemical weapons are easy to deploy and can have devastating effects, making them a very effective means of achieving military objectives. The unpredictability of chemicals (the degree of evaporation, stability and concentration) frequently proves to be incommensurate with political objectives.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The network form of organization is a decentralized, 'flat' organizational form that offers the most efficacious compromise between profit-maximizing and risk-minimizing structural forms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Network organizations are known for their flat, decentralized structure, which distinguishes them from traditional hierarchical organizations. This form of organization is characterized by a lack of clear lines of authority and decision-making power, as well as an emphasis on collaboration and flexibility.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. The term 'medicalization' refers to the process whereby a medical or health issue becomes securitized.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Medicalization is when a health issue becomes a security concern, prompting the state to take extraordinary measures to address it. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional interpretations of security studies have been based on the state as the primary actor and the focus has been on military threats. However, there is a growing recognition that non-traditional actors such as transnational corporations, terrorist groups, and environmental issues can also pose significant security challenges.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional security studies have often been criticized for being too state-centric, realist, and lacking critical questioning, so all of these options represent a move away from that approach. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Culture is the product of shared identity and interaction, although it is important in understanding the dynamics of social identity, its wider reference to security studies is largely disputed.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Culture, with its shared identities and interactions, forms the basis of social constructivism and its application to understanding security dynamics. Therefore, all of the above choices are correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking why energy security is important in contemporary studies of security. Energy security encompasses a broad range of issues that are both contemporary and fundamental to security, ranging from the local and individual to the global scale.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Energy security is a broad concept encompassing various issues, from local concerns to global challenges, making it crucial in contemporary security studies. The answer that best captures this complexity is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Realism and social constructivism are two different theories that explain how states interact with each other in the international system. Realism is based on the idea that state behaviour follows an 'action-response' pattern, while social constructivism emphasises the role of identity as a socially constructed theory. Therefore, realism differs from social constructivism in its emphasis on causality and the study of identity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivists believe the state is shaped by the international system, while realists see state interaction as a natural outcome of identity formation. Therefore, realism differs from social constructivism in that it regards identity as an independent unit whose behaviour is shaped by the requirements of the international system.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The end of the Cold War marked a significant shift in global politics and economics. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, many states were left weak and vulnerable to internal conflict. This created an opportunity for warlords to fill the power vacuum and engage in criminal activities such as drug trafficking and arms dealing. These activities provided them with the resources needed to maintain their hold on power. As a result, warlord politics became more prevalent in post-Cold War states.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Warlord politics emerged after the Cold War as a way for existing power structures to maintain control and redistribute resources, with support shifting from superpowers to the US. This was due to the collapse of state institutions and fragmentation of armed forces.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks why there is a need to establish the nature and consequences of insecurity in the developing world. We can see from the options that all of them are relevant, but option B seems to be the most comprehensive and coherent one. It covers both the empirical and conceptual aspects of the issue, as well as the normative and global dimensions. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The immense human suffering caused by violence, poverty, and disease in the developing world makes it imperative to address the issue of insecurity from a humanitarian perspective. Additionally, there is a need for conceptual frameworks that can accommodate the unique character of security challenges in this context.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A critical theoretical approach to military security studies will allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the subject matter, including non-realist paradigms such as social constructivism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A critical approach to military security would bring back the focus on the state and its role in maintaining security, which has been neglected in favor of human security and other non-traditional approaches. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks to what extent TNC is linked with terrorism and in what ways. We can see that option A provides the most comprehensive answer, as it mentions both direct partnerships between terrorist groups and transnational criminal organizations resulting from the end of the Cold War and the need to secure new forms of financial sponsorship. Option B only talks about temporary alliances which are not necessarily a long-term strategic alliance. Option C is too vague and does not provide enough information to answer the question. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The end of the Cold War forced terrorist groups to seek new funding sources, leading to widespread partnerships with transnational criminal organizations and a global diffusion of both terrorist networks and illicit markets. This suggests that TNC is linked with terrorism in a long-term strategic alliance.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Chemical weapons are defined as any weapon or device that uses toxic chemicals to kill, injure, or incapacitate people, animals, or plants. The use of such weapons is prohibited under international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was established in 1993 to ban their production, stockpiling, and deployment. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Chemical Weapons Convention effectively prohibited the possession and use of chemical weapons, significantly impacting international society and reducing the threat they pose. However, it failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Realism is a set of approaches to Security Studies that focuses on states, and tries to determine which strategy a state should adopt to achieve security and other goals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Realism in security studies is primarily concerned with military threats and how states can use their military power to ensure their security and achieve their goals. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the extent to which a society can defend itself militarily. This implies that there must be some threat or danger posed to the society's security, and that military action may be necessary to protect it.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Societal identity is inherently tied to the state, so any threat to society automatically triggers a military response from the state to protect its citizens and their way of life. This means that societal groups do not face military threats in the traditional sense, but rather they are protected by the state's military forces.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Securitization is a process through which certain issues are presented as existential threats, requiring immediate and extraordinary action. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. For a threat to be securitized, it must be presented as an existential threat to the state's survival, requiring immediate and extraordinary action outside the normal political processes. This is because securitization involves framing an issue in terms of security concerns that justify exceptional measures. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The security paradigm has been the development of multi-level analysis, to aid the understanding of disempowerment and to promote peace research involvement by NGOs, policy-makers, and the academic community.",A,"Let's reason step by step. After 9/11, the security paradigm shifted towards a more comprehensive approach, involving multi-level analysis of threats, increased peace research, and collaboration with NGOs to address the root causes of terrorism. This is an adequate response.",A
B,Let's reason step by step. Eurocentrism is a thought style in which the assessment and evaluation of non-European societies is couched in terms of the cultural assumptions and biases of Europeans.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Eurocentrism seems to describe academic works that primarily concentrate on European political and economic systems, neglecting the study of other regions. This is not a thought style or an analysis method. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental issues present a concern for peace researchers because they can have direct impacts on economic security, development, migration, and resource scarcity which in turn can lead to conflict.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main concern with environmental issues for peace researchers is the displacement of populations due to rising sea levels and resource depletion, leading to migration and societal instability. This can lead to conflict over resources and land, posing a direct threat to economic security and development.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The eight themes of post-Marxist critical security theory identified by Ken Booth are as follows: 1) the social construction of knowledge, 2) the role of power in shaping security issues, 3) the importance of language and discourse in constructing security threats, 4) the relationship between gender and security, 5) the impact of globalization on security, 6) the role of race and ethnicity in shaping security concerns, 7) the significance of class struggle in understanding security, and 8) the need for a critical approach to security studies. From this list, we can see that statement C is not one of the eight themes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that doesn't fit with post-Marxist critical security theory is the idea that human society remains constant and unchanging, as this contradicts the dynamic nature of social structures. Therefore, the answer must be C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the differences between theorizing in both sides of the Atlantic. From a US perspective, it is common to regard the main voice of security to be external. This means that they focus on what should or should not count as security issues and how to conceptualize security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The US perspective on security tends to prioritize external threats, such as military aggression from other states, as the primary source of insecurity. On the other hand, the European school emphasizes internal factors that contribute to insecurity, such as economic inequality and social exclusion.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. All of these options present significant obstacles to developing IT security, but the most important one is that there is pressure to reduce the time it takes to get a new IT product or system onto the market, so security systems are sacrificed in order to reduce the time-to-market.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The biggest challenge in developing IT security is the lack of direct financial return on investment, as security measures often don't generate immediate profits for companies. This can make it difficult to justify spending money on security systems. In addition, there may be pressure from stakeholders to reduce time-to-market and prioritize speed over security. However, this can lead to vulnerabilities in the system that could ultimately harm consumers. Therefore, the most significant obstacle is likely a combination of all three options.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Security dilemmas are a concept that describes how actions taken to increase security for one group may be perceived as threatening or destabilizing by other groups, leading to an escalation of tensions and potential conflict.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Societal security dilemmas seem to revolve around the ambiguity between cultural and ethnic nationalism, with the latter often being associated with state disintegration and conflict. Cultural nationalism is generally seen as benign and working within existing structures, while political nationalism can be more malign.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies (CSS) is a theoretical framework that seeks to challenge the dominant security paradigm by examining how power relations are constructed through political practices. It emphasizes the importance of context, interpretation and practical knowledge over generalizable causal claims. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The principle that doesn't align with Critical Security Studies is the notion that actors are solely defined by their political practices, as this overlooks the influence of social and historical contexts. In contrast, the other principles emphasize the importance of context in understanding security issues.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Security Studies is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand and address threats to human security. It encompasses both traditional military concerns as well as non-traditional issues such as climate change, terrorism, and cyber attacks. An examination of the social processes by which people construct a threat takes into account the importance of ideational factors such as culture, beliefs, norms, ideas and identity. This approach recognizes that different actors may perceive threats differently based on their own interests and values.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Security Studies should primarily focus on examining how threats are socially constructed, taking into account factors like culture, beliefs, and identity. This approach is known as constructivism. It's important to consider the moral and ethical dimensions of international affairs, but this isn't the primary focus of Security Studies.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is correct, as peace studies did indeed focus on conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping in the twentieth century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason for the resistance to peace studies during the Cold War was its association with appeasement, which was seen as a weak and dangerous approach to dealing with the Soviet Union. This led to a bitter opposition from critics who saw it as a threat to national security. In contrast, within peace studies, there has been a major interest in conflict prevention, resolution, and peacekeeping, which is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization refers to the intensification of worldwide social relations and increasing interdependence, which is a result of the compression of space and time through the development of new technologies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization can be best understood as the shrinking of the world, bringing people closer together through economic and technological connections, especially since the early 20th century. This process began in Western Europe and was driven by political power and technological advancements.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The institutional innovation of security studies was facilitated by several factors. One of the most important ones is the need for civilian expertise, which resulted from technological developments that made it necessary to deploy a given technology. This shift from targeted development of fast-changing technologies to deployment of a given technology led to the creation of new institutions and practices in the field of security studies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The institutional innovation in security studies was driven by the need for strong military leadership to coordinate economic, political, and military strategies during the Cold War. This necessitated a shift from tactical operations to long-term strategy.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Securitization is a process that involves the identification of an issue as a security threat and the adoption of extraordinary measures to address it. The securitizing actor, in this case, is usually a state or other political entity. In democratic states, the relevant audience has the right to reject the speech act if they do not agree with the securitization process. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In democratic states, the securitization process ultimately depends on the wider population, who have the right to reject the claims made by the securitizing actor. Therefore, statement A is not applicable in this context.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 'deepening and broadening' of security refers to a shift in the way we think about security, from traditional state-centric approaches to more holistic and inclusive perspectives that take into account non-traditional threats such as climate change, identity politics, and cybercrime.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The deepening and broadening of security primarily refers to the increasing recognition of the connection between identity and security, as individuals and groups seek to protect their identities from various threats. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gun shows are events that allow individuals to buy and sell firearms without undergoing a background check, which can make it easier for criminals to obtain weapons. Additionally, these events often attract people who are interested in the black market trade of arms, making them an attractive venue for those looking to purchase or sell illegal weapons.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gun shows and international arms fairs, despite facing criticism, maintain strict legal restrictions to prevent individuals with criminal records from acquiring weapons. However, these events are not regulated in the same way as gun stores or licensed dealers, which can make it easier for weapons to be resold on the black market.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The security dilemma that weak states face arises from their inability to provide stability, which creates a situation wherein each component of society competes to preserve its well-being thereby engendering insecurity. This condition is self-perpetuating and leads to emergent anarchy because measures taken to secure the regime will provoke greater resistance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The security dilemma in weak states arises from the competition among different parts of society to protect their interests, leading to a policy dilemma for the ruling elite as they try to maintain order without further weakening the state. This creates a situation where measures taken to improve the state's standing may provoke greater resistance and lead to anarchy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Human Development Report (HDR) was a landmark publication that introduced the concept of human development as an alternative to traditional measures of economic growth and national security. Since then, many scholars have built on this idea and expanded it into various fields, such as environmental security, health security, food security, gender security, etc. Therefore, all of these options are correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The most significant idea that has gained prominence in human security is the recognition that security is a contested concept, with different interpretations and priorities depending on the context. This means that security cannot be limited to military engagement or violent conflicts only but must also encompass economic, social, environmental, and cultural dimensions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Security dilemma arises out of the anarchic international system that is conceptualized by realists. Within this environment, states are obliged to seek security through their own military efforts; this is perceived as threatening to other states and so triggers an arms race spiral. The impact of security dilemmas is largely restricted to the realm of military security, although this can have far-reaching effects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The security dilemma can actually contribute to stability in the international system by creating a balance of power and discouraging excessive military buildup. However, it also has negative consequences for other aspects of security such as political and societal security.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anarchy refers to the lack of over-arching power in the international system - there is no controlling authority beyond the multiple states. In this case, anarchy means that states have their own agenda for achieving security and can determine their own goals and behaviour.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of international politics, anarchy suggests that states recognize their interconnectedness and shared interests, leading to cooperation and a sense of belonging to a larger entity. This is reflected in the realist explanation of international politics which emphasizes the importance of power and self-interest in shaping state behaviour.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. Motivational realism is a theory that states that the behaviour of so called 'greedy states' (states with an interest in increasing their wealth and power) can be explained by human nature being fundamentally greedy.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Motivational realism suggests that 'greedy states' are primarily driven by the desire to enhance their economic wealth and prosperity, leading to expansionist policies and competition for resources. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Great Law of Peace is an important document that outlines the principles and values of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a Native American confederation in North America. It emphasizes the importance of consensus-building, respect for nature, and peaceful conflict resolution. Therefore, all of these statements are true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main significance of the Great Law of Peace is its emphasis on the importance of continuous critique and self-reflection in academic research and knowledge production. This is a challenge for traditional security studies, which often rely on established practices and methods.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The overwhelming technological superiority of one side usually leads to rapid defeat of its enemy, as it allows the superior side to inflict more damage and casualties on the inferior side. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the Second World War.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The First World War saw significant advancements in military technology, such as tanks and machine guns, which gave the Allied forces a clear advantage over the Central Powers, leading to a quick resolution of the war. In contrast, the Second World War was characterized by more evenly matched technological capabilities between the Allies and Axis powers, resulting in a prolonged conflict.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The traditional approach seeks to explain why and how states have sought security. This can be done through examining the balance of power amongst major states, as well as the constraints of a state. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional security studies focuses on understanding the norms and patterns of behavior that govern interactions between states, aiming to explain how conflict is managed and cooperation is fostered in the international system. This approach emerged as a response to the Cold War, which was characterized by an accumulation of tension and competition between the two superpowers.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Commercial liberalism is probably the oldest faction of liberalism; advocating free trade as the free movement of goods and capital, it purports that the most rapid and efficient production of wealth occurs when governments do not restrict the economic activity of private actors and the free market.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Commercial liberalism promotes the idea that governments should actively regulate the market and limit the influence of private businesses to ensure economic stability and growth. This is in contrast to other factions of liberalism, which advocate for minimal government intervention in the economy.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies theory refers to the historical systematic distinction between strategic studies and security studies and the interrelation between general International Relations (IR) theory, security studies, and security theory.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies theory is unique due to its focus on the interplay between different theoretical perspectives, such as offensive and defensive realism, and the role of ideas, power, and institutions in shaping security outcomes. This makes it distinct from other fields within International Relations.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Game theory and deterrence theory were two intellectual developments in the 'golden age' of security studies that marked a significant shift in the way scholars approached security issues. Deterrence theory, which focused on preventing conflict through the threat of retaliation, was highly influential within the academic world and gained centrality politically because it allowed for a high degree of normative theorization. Game theory, on the other hand, provided a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions between actors. Both theories were accompanied by a mood of technological pessimism that fostered an ethos of critique.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of game theory and deterrence theory in security studies presented a challenge of balancing the practical application of these theories in policymaking with the need for theoretical sophistication and abstraction. This tension was reflected in the academic world, where there was a growing emphasis on normative theorization and critique of technological optimism.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The globalization process is often associated with increased interconnectedness among people across the world. This can lead to a sense of global community and shared identity, as well as the sharing of ideas, technologies, and resources that can benefit human security. However, it does not necessarily result in the redistribution of wealth or address disparities in economic and resource allocation. In fact, globalization has been criticized for exacerbating these issues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization promotes a sense of interconnectedness among people worldwide, leading to the development of shared identities and a stronger global community. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does not address disparities in economic and resource allocation across the globe.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Wendt's three cultures of anarchy are based on the idea that different actors in international relations have different motivations and goals. The Lockean culture is characterized by friendship, where force and violence is eschewed in favour of cooperation in matters of security.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In the Lockean culture of anarchy, states view security as a zero-sum game and rely on military strength for survival, leading to constant security dilemmas and the potential for conflict. This is in contrast to the other two cultures, which emphasize cooperation and restraint.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The postcolonial approach focuses on how colonialism has shaped international relations and continues to do so today. This includes examining the ways in which colonised discourse establishes notions of certain states as inferior to others, and how this affects power dynamics within the international system.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The postcolonial approach emphasizes the positive influence of European values and practices, such as free trade and democracy, in promoting peace and stability in the international system. This is because these institutions were developed during a time when colonial powers sought to create stable and prosperous societies within their colonies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. All the options are related to the concept of constraints in economics, but only one is not a type of constraint. The correct answer is C) Goals because goals are not a type of constraint, they are rather an outcome or desired state that can be influenced by constraints.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both institutional constraints and resource constraints limit the options available to decision-makers, shaping their choices and actions. Information and time horizon are also important factors that influence decisions, but they do not create any constraints themselves. Goals provide a direction for decision-making, but they can be achieved without any constraints or incentives. Therefore, the odd one out is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. International measures are employed to prevent terrorism and ensure global security. Diplomacy is an essential tool in achieving this goal as it can help countries reach agreements that will benefit all parties involved. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker.",A,"Let's reason step by step. International cooperation against terrorism requires a unified global approach with strong support from major powers to ensure legitimacy and effectiveness. Failure to attain global consensus on what terrorism is will result in disparities between states' counterterrorism methods which will severely reduce the scope of employing multi-level measures in a consistent and cohesive fashion, and may afford some terrorist groups the opportunity to seek refuge in states whose domestic laws are weaker.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditional security issues are those that threaten the state directly, such as military aggression or terrorism. However, HIV/AIDS can also be considered a non-traditional security issue because it is an illness that affects individuals and communities in ways that go beyond traditional notions of national security. It can have significant economic, social, and political impacts on affected countries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS is considered a non-traditional security issue because it is a new and evolving threat that emerged in the late 20th century, unlike traditional security concerns such as interstate conflict. Additionally, ill health can threaten the state indirectly, but also directly through its impact on other referent objects such as the economy. Finally, the overwhelming scale of HIV/AIDS requires a new approach to theorize its impact on security.",C
D,Let's reason step by step. Option A is correct because powerful states may also create alliances in order to extend their protective umbrella over weaker friendly states. This can be seen as a way for the more powerful state to maintain its influence and protect its allies from potential threats.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Powerful states form alliances like NATO to expand their sphere of influence and provide security guarantees to weaker allies, thereby enhancing their own power and prestige. States may also join an alliance if they perceive that the potential hegemonic power poses a threat to their sovereignty or security. Therefore, all options are correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Child soldiers are a complex and controversial topic in international relations, human rights, and security studies. One lens through which to investigate their role is the concept of political subjecthood, which refers to the capacity of individuals or groups to participate in political decision-making processes and have their interests represented. Children who join armed forces often do so because they are coerced, manipulated, or forced by adults, but they also develop a sense of agency, identity, and belonging that can shape their future choices and actions. Therefore, option D is the best lens through which to investigate the role of child soldiers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Children in war zones are primarily seen as innocent bystanders and victims who should be protected and kept out of the public sphere of conflict. However, this view is problematic because it ignores the fact that children can also play active roles in warfare. For example, they may join armed groups or become child soldiers themselves. Therefore, we need to investigate the role of child soldiers through a lens that recognizes their agency and political subjecthood.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Inefficient balancing or buckpassing refers to the inability of states to effectively balance against potential threats, leading to a lack of collective security. This can result in an increase in non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and cyber attacks. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When states fail to effectively balance power or engage in buck-passing, it encourages a more cooperative international system with reduced military tensions. However, this can also lead to an increase in non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and cyber attacks.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'energy security nexus' refers to the interdependence between energy resources, security, and economic development. It is a complex issue that has far-reaching implications for international relations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'energy security nexus' has shifted power dynamics in favor of resource-rich countries in the 'South', enabling them to challenge the dominance of the 'North' and reduce global inequalities. This is a significant outcome.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The new critical schools of security studies have been important for the development of security studies because they have challenged traditional notions of security and expanded the scope of what is considered to be a security issue. They have also emphasized the importance of policy knowledge in shaping security policies, which has led to more engagement with policymakers and think tanks. This has helped to bridge the gap between academia and practice.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The next generation of critical security studies scholars will focus on providing practical solutions to policy challenges and working closely with policymakers to shape security agendas. This is a significant shift from the traditional approach, which was more focused on theoretical debates.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Realism is an international relations theory that emphasises the role of power and self-interest in shaping state behaviour. According to realists, war is more likely when a state is losing power, a decline in a state's ability to protect itself from attack, coercion and vulnerability increases its motivation to engage in aggressive behaviour.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In an international system where offensive capabilities outweigh defensive ones, states are more inclined to engage in aggression due to the perceived advantage of striking first. This is a characteristic of realist theory.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The global defence trade is a complex system involving many actors, including governments, private companies, and non-state actors. While the bulk of this trade is legal, we know that there are instances where weapons are transferred on the black or grey markets. This suggests that illicit arms trading takes place to some degree.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The extent of illegal arms trading within the global defense market remains largely unknown due to the lack of reliable data and the secretive nature of such activities. However, we do know that a certain amount of trade takes place on the black and grey markets, which are often associated with criminal organizations and terrorist groups.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies is not a positivist approach, but rather it questions the epistemological principles of other approaches in Security Studies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies maintains a clear distinction between the researcher studying security issues and the subjects being studied, ensuring objectivity and unbiased analysis. This is not accurately applied to any of the other statements.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. The question asks us to describe the basis of the case for humanitarian intervention. We can eliminate options A and D as they do not accurately reflect the main idea behind this concept.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The justification for humanitarian intervention stems from the Kantian principle that individuals possess inherent human rights that must be protected, even if it requires intervention in another state's affairs. This aligns with the foundational idea of liberalism and cosmopolitanism.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Structural adjustment policies are a set of neoliberal reforms implemented by international financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to promote economic growth and stability in developing countries. The policies have been criticized for their negative impact on social welfare, human rights, and environmental sustainability. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The goal of structural adjustment policies was to promote economic stability and growth in developing countries, so they must have been largely successful in achieving these aims. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nations can be defined as a group of people who share common cultural, historical, or political ties and are usually distinguished from other groups based on their shared identity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A nation is defined by a shared ethnic identity and cultural heritage, so it's natural that it would be made up of different ethnic-identity groups. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. Peace studies is a field that seeks to understand how technology can be used to promote peace and reduce conflict. Recent technological change and development have had significant implications for this goal.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Technological advancements, like better communication tools, will likely strengthen the power of established international players and reinforce their influence in the global system. This is because they have more resources to take advantage of these new technologies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Energy is a crucial component for economic development, as it powers industries and transportation systems. Therefore, energy security is intrinsically linked with economic and development security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Energy security is primarily concerned with ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies, which directly impacts economic development and stability. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Westphalia defined state sovereignty as being subjective to the behaviour of the political or ruling elite in that state, prioritizing human welfare over arbitrary values of sovereignty and thus legitimising humanitarian intervention where necessary.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Westphalia emphasizes the importance of human welfare and allows for intervention when a state's actions threaten its own population. This is in contrast to the contemporary global security environment, which prioritizes non-intervention.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Ideal Policy framework provides an analytical framework for practitioners' success in understanding the contextual factors influencing the use of coercive diplomacy, and it focuses on the use of coercive diplomacy to counter aggression. The Ideal Policy explains and predicts outcomes with a minimum of success conditions on the basis of the coercer's actions only.",A,Let's reason step by step. The Ideal Policy framework helps us understand why policymakers choose to use coercive diplomacy by analyzing the context and various factors influencing their decisions. This understanding can help practitioners make more informed choices when implementing coercive diplomacy.,A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first option is incorrect because it does not mention any negative impact on the environment. Option B is also incorrect as it mentions that war impacts negatively on the sustainable growth of the nation, which contradicts the concept of environmental security. Option C is partially correct but it only mentions two ways in which armed forces can be linked to environmental security and not all of them are positive. The last option D is incorrect because it does not mention any negative impact on the environment either.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Military forces can play a positive role in environmental security by securing access to resources, rebuilding infrastructure, and promoting sustainable development. However, they can also have negative impacts on the environment through pollution, resource depletion, and destruction of ecosystems.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism is an approach to international relations theory that emphasizes the role of social norms, values, and ideas in shaping state behavior. In this context, militarization refers to the process through which a society increases its military capabilities or engages in military activities. According to social constructivists, militarization is not a natural or inevitable outcome of geopolitical realities but rather a socially constructed phenomenon that reflects shared beliefs about what constitutes a security threat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivists prioritize human security and view militarization as harmful, advocating for demilitarization and peaceful solutions. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first option suggests that the state has strong control over its weaponry, which is unlikely to be true in most cases. The second option suggests that there is no evidence of illegal trading by states, which is also unlikely given the prevalence of corruption and weak governance in many parts of the world. The third option suggests that illegal trading by states is the primary way in which weapons purchased legally might end up on the black or grey arms markets, which is a reasonable assumption. The fourth option suggests that looting and theft are common ways for weapons to enter the illicit market, especially where corruption is endemic and security measures are weak. Given this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. States have strong control over their weapon stockpiles and robust systems in place to prevent illegal trading, so it's unlikely their weapons would end up on the illicit market. However, there is evidence that state-owned weapons can be traded illegally as part of the black or grey arms markets.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism (HM) is a philosophical approach that focuses on how changes in particular structures and inequalities of power are vital to the rise and fall of discourses. Discourse, as defined here, refers to the ways in which ideas and beliefs are communicated between individuals or groups. Therefore, it can be said that HM is interested in how changes in these structures and inequalities affect the discourse surrounding them.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism is all about analyzing discourse and how it shapes international relations, making it distinct from other approaches. However, HM also recognizes that changes in structures and inequalities of power are crucial to the rise and fall of discourses.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. TNC is a new concept because it refers to organized crime groups structured with formal roles for members, continuity of membership and developed purposes for the intent of committing crimes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Transnational criminal organizations are structured groups with clear roles for their members and a reliance on systematic violence to achieve their criminal goals. These groups have been around for centuries, however the term 'transnational crime' is relatively new as it refers specifically to organized crime that operates across national borders.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Booth's attitude toward constructivism and post-structuralism within Critical Security Studies can be described as critical. He believes that both theories are ill-defined, vague, and lack the substance required by scholars in contemporary security studies. Constructivism is too dangerous a mix of political ideologies, combining elements of radicalism and relativism. Post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific and applicable political theory.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both constructivism and post-structuralism are poorly defined and lack the necessary rigor for serious study in security studies. Constructivism is too dangerous, combining elements of radicalism and relativism, while post-structuralism is more of an orientation to world politics rather than a specific political theory.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The international arms trade is a highly complex issue that has been difficult to control, as evidenced by the failures of arms control measures in the 20th and 21st century.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The global arms trade is inherently problematic, and the only way to truly control it is through a complete and total ban on all weapons and arms sales. This would require cooperation between governments and other actors, but ultimately, it is the best solution.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks how examination of previous state practice and policy can be used to justify humanitarian intervention. Previous state practice since the end of the Cold War suggests that there is a customary right of humanitarian intervention, but not of duty, in response to humanitarian emergencies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Numerous instances of humanitarian intervention throughout history, like the response to the Rwandan genocide, demonstrate a clear right to intervene in such crises. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily imply an obligation to do so.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Materialism is a philosophical concept that emphasizes the importance of material factors in shaping human society and culture. In the context of historical materialism, it refers to the focus on class struggle and the productive basis of societies as well as the ways in which social structures have the capacity to change and produce change.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'materialism' in historical materialism reflects its roots in postmodern philosophy and its emphasis on subjective interpretations of reality. In contrast, HM scholars reject the notion that wealth is a central determinant of power and instead focus on class relations as the primary source of social change.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The post-Cold War era has seen a significant increase in transnational crime, which has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. Organized crime has been the primary focus of state responses to this threat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Governments' responses to transnational crime have been heavily influenced by the US war on drugs, emphasizing bilateral cooperation and law enforcement efforts. This approach has resulted in a militarization of law enforcement, with an emphasis on using military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Economic theory asserts that actors act in their own best interest, but this is not always true because they are influenced by external forces such as social norms, cultural values, and political pressures. Information plays a significant role in decision making because it can help actors make more informed choices based on the available data. In other words, information helps actors to understand the consequences of their actions and make better decisions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In today's economy, information has become a valuable commodity that can be bought and sold, making it a crucial aspect of decision-making. This is because actors are not always able to make rational choices based on their own self-interest alone; they must also consider the information available to them at the time.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The authors argue that there are several factors that influence the outcomes of coercive diplomacy, including the global strategic environment, type of provocation, image of war, unilateral or coalitional coercive diplomacy, isolation of the adversary, clarity of objective, strength of motivation and asymmetry of motivation, sense of urgency, strong leadership, domestic support, international support, opponents fear of unacceptable escalation, clarity concerning the precise terms of settlement. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. According to George and Simons, the success of coercive diplomacy mainly depends on the global strategic environment, the type of provocation, and the image of war. Unilateral or coalitional coercive diplomacy is more likely to succeed than isolation of the adversary, clarity of objective, strength of motivation and asymmetry of motivation. Sense of urgency, strong leadership, domestic support, international support, opponents fear of unacceptable escalation, and clarity concerning the precise terms of settlement are all contextual variables that can influence outcomes but they do not determine success or failure.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. The changing global security environment will have significant impacts on the nature of developing conflicts in the twenty-first century.,A,"Let's reason step by step. As resources become scarce and populations migrate, conflicts will primarily arise from ideological clashes and cultural differences between diverse groups. Economic interdependency may reduce conflict at the international level but not necessarily at the sub-national level where competition for resources is likely to increase.",C
D,Let's reason step by step. Hierarchical forms of transnational criminal activity are primarily territorially affiliated to a particular state / ethnic-cultural group and have limited transnational potential.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Hierarchical transnational criminal organizations are highly adaptable and resilient, making them difficult to combat but also limiting their ability to operate across borders. Therefore, targeting the proceeds or leadership would be more effective in reducing their threat on the legitimate economy.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism posits that identities, norms, and ideas are just as important as material structures in shaping the international system. Therefore, option A is correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism emphasizes the role of social interactions and shared meanings in shaping identities, so the importance of identities must be a fundamental principle. However, anarchy is not an inherent feature of the international system, but rather a result of power imbalances and conflicting interests.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cyber threats are a growing concern for individuals and organisations alike. While complete eradication of these threats may not be possible, there are effective ways to secure against them. Option B is the most appropriate answer as it recognises that cyber warfare is a real threat and advocates for immediate action when instances occur.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A comprehensive strategy that encompasses all possible solutions, such as eliminating threats, acknowledging the severity of cyberwarfare, and taking swift action, would be the most effective way to ensure cybersecurity. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Buzan et al.'s theory of sectoral security analysis is based on the idea that there are distinct and separate sectors of security, such as economic, environmental, or health security. HM rejects this assertion, instead adopting a holistic view of security within which national and transnational class is an important factor. This means that HM favours a more nuanced approach to security analysis, one that takes into account the complex interplay between different factors that contribute to insecurity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. HM acknowledges the value of the sectoral framework in security analysis, recognizing the comprehensive insights it provides into various security dimensions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of environmental security has been gaining traction in recent years as the negative effects of environmental insecurity become increasingly evident. This trend is likely to continue, particularly with increasing evidence of the impact of climate change and other environmental issues on national security interests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As environmental insecurity worsens, nations will prioritize their own interests and take unilateral measures to preserve their social organization, even if it means increasing the risk of conflict. This is because national security practices are seen as the most effective way to achieve environmental security reforms.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The pragmatic implications of biology on post-conflict gender security are complex and multifaceted. While it is true that women have often been targets of violence in conflict, they may also suffer at the hands of their protectors. This suggests that there may be a need for greater protection for female soldiers in certain types of peacekeeping work.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The complex relationship between armed forces and civilian women, where women can be both victims and beneficiaries of military presence, weakens the case for female soldiers in peacekeeping operations due to potential risks and complications. This strengthens the argument that post-conflict gender security should focus on addressing these issues.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Actors are the ones who take action to produce security or insecurity. The referent object is what we act on to make secure. Objective security refers to when a matter is objectively considered a security issue, regardless of interpretation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Substantive content in security studies refers to objective security issues that are universally acknowledged as threats, regardless of individual interpretations or perspectives. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals or corporations own and control the means of production, distribution, and exchange. The capitalist economic sphere is non-political to liberalists and realists because it is seen as a self-regulating market that does not require government intervention. However, HM regards capitalism as producing extreme insecurity in its disempowerment of the worker or labourer, from whom the ability to control labour or output is removed by the capitalist. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. HM's main concern with capitalism lies in its misrepresentation as a non-political entity, serving the interests of the capitalist elite while obscuring its impact on power dynamics and social relations. The assertion that it produces extreme insecurity is also true, but not the only aspect of capitalism that HM focuses on.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism offers an alternative to traditional realist approaches to security studies that focuses on the role of ideas, norms, and identities in shaping state behaviour. This perspective has been criticised for its failure to be applicable to contemporary conflict situations, but it also provides ontological clarification for some of the questions raised by the traditionalist approach. The strength of the approach lies in its application to theories of social security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Applying a social constructivist lens to security studies would enable the development of empirically testable theories and uncover objective truths about the international system, furthering our understanding of security dynamics. This is an important contribution that cannot be ignored.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The human security concept has been criticized for being too broad and not specific enough to address the root causes of insecurity. This criticism is valid because a more focused approach would be able to identify and target the underlying issues that contribute to insecurity, rather than just treating the symptoms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of human security aligns with the principles of global capitalism, as it emphasizes individual empowerment and economic development as key aspects of security. Therefore, option B is a common criticism of the human security concept.",B
A,Let's reason step by step. Thick space is a concept used in postcolonial analysis to describe the international as a space generated by the knowledge and practice of Western powers to favour the so-called third world.,B,"Let's reason step by step. In postcolonial analysis, 'thick space' refers to the power structures and norms embedded within the Westphalian system, which reinforce Eurocentric perspectives and hierarchies in international relations. This term is used to critique the ways in which the international is constructed as a dense set of relations that favour Western powers over other countries.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The process of securitization is a complex one, and it requires several conditions to be met for it to succeed. One of these conditions is that the general public must be convinced of the legitimacy of the proposed threat. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the general public remains unconvinced of the legitimacy of a proposed threat, the issue is unlikely to be successfully securitized, as public support is crucial for the process. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy is the use of threats or force to achieve political objectives, without resorting to military action. Deterrence as a strategy has dominated contemporary instances of coercive diplomacy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy involves a gentle and gradual approach to international negotiations, seeking to influence adversaries through subtle pressure and persuasion rather than direct threats or force. This is in contrast to the more aggressive tactics of compellence and pre-emptive use of force. Deterrence has also been used as a strategy in coercive diplomacy, but it is not the only one.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism is a field of study that examines the legacy of colonialism and imperialism on societies, cultures, and politics. The term 'subaltern' was coined by Indian scholar Gayatri Spivak to refer to those who are located geographically within the southern hemisphere, but this definition has been expanded to include all marginalized or oppressed groups outside of the hegemonic power structure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In postcolonial studies, the term 'subaltern' typically refers to individuals or groups located within the southern hemisphere, often facing marginalization and limited representation in global power dynamics.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is an act of violence that aims to create fear or panic in a population for political, religious, ideological, or other purposes. There are different types of terrorism based on their motives and targets. The most common ones are religious, leftist, right-wing, ethnic, linguistic, nationalist, separatist, and state-sponsored. However, not all groups that use violence for these reasons can be classified as terrorists. Some may have legitimate grievances or goals, while others may be acting out of fanaticism or desperation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorist groups are primarily organized based on shared ethnic or linguistic identities, with these factors serving as the main driving forces behind their actions and goals. However, it is important to note that not all terrorist groups fit neatly into this category, as some may draw inspiration from religious ideologies or political beliefs.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A fusion weapon is a three-stage-bomb that uses an implosion device to create a fission reaction, which then detonates a fusion reaction. It is often referred to as a thermo-nuclear or hydrogen device and has unlimited destructive potential.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A fusion device operates in two stages: a gun-type device initiates a series of fission reactions, culminating in a high-energy flash explosion with immense thermal energy. The mass difference between the two lighter nuclei and the resulting energy released is highly specific and can be precisely calculated. This makes it an extremely powerful weapon.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Human security refers to a broad concept that encompasses various aspects of human well-being, including physical safety, economic stability, and access to basic needs such as food, water, and healthcare. While all the given options contribute to human security in some way, only option D does not constitute 'human security' because it implies that individuals are self-sufficient and do not require state support for their well-being. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Human security primarily focuses on ensuring that every citizen is free from physical violence and protected from immediate threats, regardless of their identity or background. Therefore, a condition where people are guaranteed the ability to live and develop, free from political oppression or prejudice, safe from threats posed by their own or external state actors does not constitute human security.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The illicit arms trade is the illegal manufacturing, trafficking, and use of firearms, their parts, and ammunition. It poses a significant threat to global security and stability. The UN has taken several measures to combat this issue, including creating protocols and resolutions. However, none of these options are directly related to the illicit arms trade. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2001 UN Security Council Resolution 1308, which addresses HIV/AIDS as a national security threat, is a significant international agreement aimed at combating the illicit arms trade. However, it does not directly address this issue. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The securitization process is a political strategy that aims to transform an issue from one that is considered non-security related into one that is security relevant. This transformation allows for the mobilization of resources and support for policies in specific areas, which can be seen as a tangible benefit.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The main advantage of securitization lies in its ability to inject urgency into an issue, leading to sustained political support and resource allocation, even if it may not necessarily enhance efficiency or problem-solving. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,Let's reason step by step. The exclusion of women from the military sphere or from armed combat is important because it can be based on arbitrary and discriminatory rationale that can limit women's participation in civil society in other ways.,C,"Let's reason step by step. The exclusion of women from the military sphere is important because it prevents female veterans from potentially gaining powerful positions in political offices and state institutions, which could disrupt existing power dynamics. Additionally, participation in military activity is often regarded as a sign of strength, patriotism and courage, so excluding women from this sphere can be seen as discriminatory and limiting their opportunities for personal growth and development.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy is a strategy that uses threats of limited force to induce an adversary's incentive to comply with the coercer's demands. It is different from military force, which seeks to defeat an opponent first and leaves no element of choice for the target.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy involves using force to compel an adversary's compliance, leaving them with no choice but to submit or engage in conflict, ultimately seeking control through dominance and eliminating opportunities for negotiation. Military force, on the other hand, is a more aggressive approach that seeks to defeat an opponent first before considering diplomatic solutions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental changes can undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. So if the natural capital base of an economy erodes than so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental challenges can lead to innovation and diversification of the economy, which can ultimately strengthen a nation's military capabilities by fostering technological advancements. However, environmental changes can also undermine national security in many ways; including weakening the economic base that determines military capacity. Any developments however, will be 'human' in impact.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first three statements are all examples of strategies that can be used by the state to control and strengthen cultural values, while the last statement is an example of a strategy that allows for the withdrawal of a societal group from within a larger entity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both options C and D involve the removal of a specific social group from a larger entity, aiming to preserve the identity and security of the remaining population. Option A talks about institutions that can be used to control cultural values, while option B discusses political-nationalist strategies. Therefore, the odd one out is option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Weak states are vulnerable to external challenges due to their inability to maintain internal security and provide basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. This makes them attractive targets for powerful states that seek to exploit their weaknesses. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The widespread availability of small arms within weak states empowers non-state actors and poses a significant threat to the state's authority and stability. This is because it increases the risk of army disaffection, possible coups and undermines the state's ability to maintain law and order.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Western response to the Arab Spring was marked by a number of challenges to liberalism. First, it is true that the liberalist perspective is based on ideas that are Western- such as democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights. However, this does not mean that these ideas are inherently superior or universal. Second, liberalism did not provide a clear way to deal with the Arab Spring, and its inconsistencies and contradictions were exposed. For example, some countries in the region embraced liberal values while others remained authoritarian. Finally, the liberalist perspective does not explain clearly how and when liberalism is supposed to spread, in this case to the Arab countries in question. Therefore, all of the above statements are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Arab Spring exposed the limitations of liberalism in providing a definitive framework for addressing complex political and social upheavals in non-Western contexts. While liberalism has been successful in promoting democracy, free enterprise, and civil rights in many Western countries, it has not provided a clear way to deal with the unique challenges posed by the Arab Spring. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
A,Let's reason step by step. The Copenhagen School's view of security is a constructivist approach that emphasizes the socially constructed nature of security and how threats are defined by society. This means that what constitutes an existential threat is subjective to the context in which it exists.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The Copenhagen School aligns with constructivism by highlighting the subjective nature of security threats, which are shaped by social discourse and collective interpretations. This view contrasts with traditional paradigms that emphasize state-centric approaches to security.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first two options are incorrect as they do not address the question at hand. Option A is a general statement about arms control that does not apply to cyber-security, while option B is an example of successful deterrence in another security realm but it does not necessarily translate well to cyber-security. Option C provides a valid argument against using traditional arms control strategies for cyber-security as the verification required would be impossible. Therefore, the correct answer must be D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The principles of arms control, which focus on limiting the quantity and capabilities of weapons, are not applicable to the intangible and rapidly evolving nature of cyber threats. Deterrence strategies, however, can be effective in preventing attacks or deterring potential attackers from launching them. Therefore, successful policies of arms control and deterrence have translated well from other security realms, such as nuclear weapons control strategies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The liberalist conception of the international system is based on the idea that states are fundamentally alike, and therefore can cooperate with each other for mutual benefit. This means that the nation state does exist as a unitary actor within the international system, and that it should be considered in the study of International Relations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism recognizes the unique characteristics and interests of individual states, leading to the conclusion that states exhibit significant differences in their approaches to international relations. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism is a theoretical framework that emerged from the study of colonialism and its aftermath, which has been widely adopted in various fields such as political science, sociology, anthropology, and international relations. One defining feature of postcolonialism is its focus on the role of violence in world politics, particularly how colonial powers used violence to maintain their dominance over colonized peoples. This perspective also emphasizes the importance of decolonization and the need for a more inclusive and diverse approach to security studies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism challenges the traditional focus on the state as the primary referent object in security studies by highlighting the importance of considering the security concerns of marginalized communities and non-state actors. It also emphasizes the role of violence, particularly colonial violence, in shaping contemporary world politics. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Military moms play a crucial role in sustaining and expanding the US military force, as they provide both financial and emotional support for their children's education and future careers. Moreover, mothers are often targeted by recruiters who use various tactics to appeal to their sense of duty and patriotism. Therefore, examining the role of ‘military moms' reveals the extent of gendered strategizing that is required to raise and sustain a military force.",B,"Let's reason step by step. 'Military moms' play a crucial role in encouraging and facilitating the enlistment of their children, actively contributing to the maintenance and expansion of military forces. They are not passive objects but active agents who shape the recruitment process through their engagement with military recruiters.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about an agenda that would attract scholars to the 'broad church' of security studies, which implies a willingness to challenge traditional paradigms and broaden the scope of what constitutes security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'broad church' of security studies advocates for a shift towards a positivist methodology that emphasizes empirical evidence and individual security concerns, challenging the dominance of traditional state-centric approaches. This is reflected in Krause and Williams' agenda to question the referent object, challenge the traditional conception of military security as paramount to the state, and change the way in which security is studied.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'international regime' is used in political science to refer to a set of formal or informal principles that govern international relations between states. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cooperation between states can lead to many benefits, including potential for arms control and unilateral restraint, improvement of political relationships between states, and the eradication of the propensity for states to cheat on agreements such as arms control or disarmament deals. However, cooperation is not always beneficial. One disadvantage of cooperation between states is that it may encourage further cooperation from neighbouring states. This can lead to a situation where one state feels compelled to cooperate with another state even if they do not want to. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cooperation between states creates opportunities for individual states to exercise restraint in their military capabilities, fostering a more stable and secure international environment. Additionally, cooperation can improve political relationships between states, leading to increased trust and communication. However, the statement that cooperation encourages further cooperation from neighbouring states is not necessarily true. In fact, some states may view cooperation as a sign of weakness or vulnerability, potentially encouraging them to take advantage of their neighbours. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. All of the options listed are legitimate threats to societal security, as they can lead to social unrest, political instability, and human rights violations.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Development is a complex concept that can be defined in many ways, depending on who you ask. However, one common definition is that development refers to the human condition in which there is freedom from fear and want; there are sufficient resources to sustain life and this life can exist in a state free from the threat, or perceived threat, of sudden interruption.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Development is primarily measured by a nation's economic and political standing within the international system, reflecting its integration into global markets and adherence to established norms. This definition of development aligns with the concept of neoliberal globalization, which emphasizes free market economics and liberal democratic values.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Realist theory is an international relations theory that emphasizes the role of power and self-interest in shaping state behavior. One of its key characteristics is that states are unitary and rational actors, meaning they will act in a way suited to achieving their goals. Another important feature is that states assess one another in terms of their power and capabilities rather than their internal variations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Realist theory primarily focuses on the distribution of power and capabilities among states, assuming that states act rationally to maximize their security and interests in an anarchic international system. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism is a theory that emphasizes the role of social interactions and shared meanings in shaping our understanding of reality. Identity is an important concept in this theory because it helps us understand how individuals and groups come to share certain beliefs, values, and norms. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B because identity is not a naturally bestowed quality but rather something that is socially constructed through interactions with others.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism emphasizes the central role of identity in shaping actors' preferences and actions, as identity provides a foundation for understanding their interests and motivations. Therefore, it is not applicable to social constructivism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Health security is vital to achieving human security, when considering the individual as the referent object of security studies, fatal or potentially fatal infection directly undermines the attainment of security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The spread of disease within a population can directly threaten regime security by incapacitating key government officials and disrupting essential functions of the state. It can also indirectly undermine security by affecting the health and well-being of citizens, which in turn affects their ability to participate in society and contribute to its stability.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental security entails a consideration of the security of the global environment, as well as its nested sub-systems and social systems beyond the boundaries of the nation state.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism is a theoretical framework that emphasizes the role of culture and society in shaping our understanding of reality. It has been applied to military security studies, arguing that broader approaches should be adopted that take into account social and development factors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism, with its emphasis on subjective interpretations and social factors, contradicts the objective and materialist foundations of realist military security studies, rendering it inadequate for understanding military affairs. This has led to claims that broader approaches should be adopted, including the proposed employment of social and development specialists in conflict situations.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of R2P rests on three pillars, which are the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), the Responsibility to Prevent (RtP) and the Responsibility to Rebuild (R3P). Of these, the most widely acclaimed pillar is the Responsibility to Prevent (RtP).",B,"Let's reason step by step. R2P is all about taking action to protect populations from mass atrocities, so the most important pillar must be the responsibility to react swiftly and decisively to prevent such events. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Buzan's concept of societal security marked a departure from traditional understandings of security in that it emphasized the importance of non-military factors, such as resource and environmental security, for understanding security.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Buzan's concept of societal security emphasizes the importance of a state's sustainable development as a primary security concern, separate from traditional military considerations. This marks a departure from previous understandings of security that focused primarily on military threats.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism is an ideology that emphasises individual freedom, democracy and cooperation among nations. It advocates for the inclusion of non-governmental organisations and other actors to encourage cooperation and build communities. This attitude towards international organisations can be seen as a way to enhance national and international security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism generally views international organizations with caution, as their involvement in the political system can weaken the state's authority and ultimately compromise security. However, some schools of thought within liberalism argue that cooperation through these organisations can enhance national and international security.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Human Development Report, published by the United Nations Development Program in 1994, challenged the traditional security paradigm by outlining seven areas or components of human security that policymakers should henceforth devote greater political attention and capital to: economic security, food security, health security, environmental security, personal security, community security, and political security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Human Development Report's main contribution was outlining the seven key components of human security that require greater attention from policymakers, shifting the focus from state-centric security.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Nuclear weapons have devastating effects on both human life and infrastructure. A nuclear detonation produces EMP, a thermal light pulse, blast, and fallout at the moment of detonation. The electro-magnetic pulse occurs when gamma radiation interacts with matter (the atmosphere), the Compton effect. EMP produces a high voltage charge, harmless to humans but destructive to electronic systems. EMP effects are maximized at high altitude. However, thermal-light pulse can produce flash blindness, retinal burn, and fire whilst the airburst can cause severe skin burns.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The most devastating effect of nuclear weapons is the immense shockwave generated by the explosion, capable of leveling entire cities and causing widespread casualties. This blast wave can be lethal even at a distance from the detonation site. Additionally, the thermal light pulse produced by the explosion can cause flash blindness and severe burns to the skin. Finally, the fallout resulting from the nuclear reaction can lead to radiation poisoning if inhaled or ingested. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Human Development Report is a report published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The distinction between limited force and full-scale war is crucial because resort to brute force means that diplomacy has failed. The distinction is not based on the amount of force or the type, but on the purpose that the use of force seeks to accomplish and the element of choice left to the adversary. In essence, limited force is a bargaining tool.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The key difference between limited force and full-scale force lies in the extent of force employed and the resulting policy outcome. If the desired goals are achieved, it indicates the use of limited force. However, if the desired outcomes are not achieved, then we can say that full-scale war has been used.",D

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. Prevention is normally associated with the concept of terrorism as war or crime. All governments will practice prevention (seen as repression from the terrorist perspective) by seeking to arrest or eliminate those actively involved in the violence. Security forces attack the terrorists before they strike (war) or they are arrested after the attack (crime).,A,"Let's reason step by step. One way to prevent terrorism is to address the root causes and grievances that fuel it, often through political reforms and diplomatic engagement with communities susceptible to radicalization. This approach aims to reduce the appeal of violence within society and promote peaceful coexistence. However, this method has been criticized for being too soft and ineffective in deterring terrorists from carrying out attacks.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The different relationship between US and European security studies can be explained in several ways. In Europe, the debate has stayed as part of politico-self-reflection of the scholar who 'does security;', whereas in the US, the question of the concept of security is seen at the most a necessary 'define your' terms' operation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The contrasting perspectives on security between the US and Europe stem from their different interpretations of global power dynamics, with the US emphasizing its hegemonic role and Europe focusing on the challenges of unipolarity.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism has been defined in different ways depending on the context and perspective. In this case, we are looking at how the response to terrorism influences the government's actions. We can see that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Governments often view terrorism as a societal disease, requiring reform packages to address underlying grievances and reduce the attractiveness of terrorist ideologies within the population. However, these reforms may inadvertently fuel violence if they are seen as concessions or rewards for terrorists. Additionally, contemporary responses to terrorism have been heavily influenced by the war on terror analogy, which emphasizes retaliation and pre-emptive action against key individuals and sources of funding.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both HM and realism are based on the notion that there exist within society certain discernable realities. However, whilst realism focuses more broadly on the nature of international relations, HM has some aspects in common with realism, liberalism, and social constructivism, but it offers something distinctive in having class conflict within capitalism as its central focus.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The first factor that enabled the expansion of TNC in the 1990s was the declining expenditure on defence and the standing down of armies, which reduced the risk of activities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of transnational crime in the 1990s can be attributed to improved intelligence gathering and communication technologies, which enabled authorities to better assess the true extent of these criminal activities. This is supported by the fact that international trends such as globalization may have had the unintended consequence of opening up new spaces for the development of transnational crime.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Copenhagen School's approach to Security Studies is based on an objectivist epistemology, which means that it considers security as a real-world phenomenon that can be studied objectively from a positivist perspective. In contrast, Critical Security Studies regards security to be a social construction, based on the changeable ideas that form human society. Therefore, the Copenhagen School's approach differs from that of Critical Security Studies in terms of epistemology.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Copenhagen School, with its focus on securitization and the social construction of threats, aligns more closely with constructivist approaches to security, while Critical Security Studies emphasizes objective analysis of security issues. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Cold War developments have undermined state authority in many ways, including the increased levels of globalization in trade, finance, and movement that have produced an environment conducive to TNC by making it easier for criminals to move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide service, and smuggle persons across borders.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The primary factor undermining state authority in the post-Cold War era is globalization, as increased trade, finance, and movement across borders provide opportunities for transnational criminal activities. This includes organized crime groups that can move illicit profits and illegal goods, provide services, and smuggle persons across borders. Additionally, political transitions to democracy and economic transitions to free market capitalism have undermined state capacity to enforce rule of law and created new opportunities for organized crime groups to penetrate societies in transition. Finally, the sharp increase in civil conflicts around the globe has also contributed to a new generation of refugees who provide family and ethnic ties that help facilitate transnational criminal enterprises.",B

This is evidenced by the fact that it was inter-disciplinary and politically orientated with immediate policy responsibility.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Conflict has been a concern of the environmental security agenda for strong states because it is often linked with resource scarcity and inequity, which are key drivers of violence. Therefore, there is a strong connection between environmental degradation and conflict.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental change, particularly resource scarcity, is a major driver of conflict between strong states, as competition for essential resources intensifies and leads to violent confrontations. There is therefore a strong connection between environmental degradation and violence; resources as strategic goals and strategic tools may cause violence if there is inequity.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. Policy-academe developments have resulted in the modification of the role of think tanks away from policy towards politicization resistant theory.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The institutionalization of academe-policy interaction in security studies led to a more diverse and multidisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, economics, and other fields.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The new terminology of RMA is based on the concept of precision targeting, which means that military operations should be carried out with minimal collateral damage and maximum effectiveness. Therefore, a phrase that does not fit this criterion is likely to indicate illegitimacy in the new terminology of RMA. In this case, the most appropriate answer is an indiscriminate attack.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'surgical strike,' despite implying precision, often involves significant collateral damage and can be considered an indiscriminate attack on a target area. Therefore, it is not likely to indicate legitimacy in the new terminology of RMA.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Energy security is a complex concept that can be defined in different ways depending on the context. However, one of the most widely accepted definitions is that it refers to the ability of individuals, economic and non-state actors to access the energy required for sustaining their growth and development.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Arms control is a strategic policy that aims to reduce or eliminate weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other conventional weapons. It does not challenge the central role of weaponry and military power in the international system, instead focusing on the problems produced by specific weapon systems and relationships. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Arms control is a cooperative security approach where states work together to address the security dilemma and reduce the risk of conflict by managing and limiting arms. This policy was pursued during the Cold War as a means of achieving security, but it does not challenge the central role of weaponry in the international system. Instead, it focuses on specific weapon systems and relationships that can lead to instability and conflict.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first mention of the term 'cyber-security' was in a speech given by President Clinton on March 17, 1994. This indicates that cyber-security discourse emerged around this time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With the advent of computers and early networks in the 1960s, concerns about cyber-security naturally emerged as governments and organizations began to recognize the potential vulnerabilities of these new technologies.

A,Let's reason step by step. Critics fear that granting rights of humanitarian intervention would lead to an abuse of this power in order to wage state-interested wars.,A,"Let's reason step by step. While some states might use humanitarian intervention to promote democracy and neoliberalism, the main concern is that it could be misused to advance specific ideologies or political agendas under the guise of humanitarianism. This could lead to an abuse of power and a loss of military resources pursuing wars on ethical grounds.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The end of the Cold War led to a decrease in global tensions and an increase in cooperation between nations, which has led to a growing effort by governments to prevent the spread of weapons, especially of WMDs. This trend is reflected in the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was adopted in 2013 and aims to regulate the international trade in conventional arms. The growth in volume of the arms trade is also evident, as countries continue to invest heavily in their defence capabilities. However, this growth has been tempered by a change in the nature of conflict, with an increasing focus on non-traditional security threats such as terrorism and cyber attacks. This trend is reflected in the development of new technologies for defence purposes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and cyber warfare systems.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The changing nature of warfare, with a shift towards asymmetric conflicts and new technologies, is the primary driver of trends in the global defense trade, influencing the types of weapons and equipment sought by states. This has led to an increased focus on non-proliferation efforts, as well as a growth in volume of the arms trade.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about internal security policy options available to elites, which means that the answer should be related to how elites can maintain their power and control within a state. Option A talks about creating negative inducements for non-support of the regime, but this does not necessarily involve elites. Option B mentions coercive power, but it does not specifically mention internal security policy options. Option C talks about fostering a new politics of identity, which is not related to maintaining power and control within a state. Option D talks about democratic reform, which may be one way for weak states to gain popular legitimacy internally, but it does not necessarily involve elites. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Elites in weak states often resort to negative inducements, such as denying access to resources or commercial opportunities, to discourage opposition and maintain their grip on power. This is option A.",A
C,Let's reason step by step. Human insecurity is an interchangeable concept with environmental insecurity; environmental change invariably undermines human security because its impact is always 'human' and acts as a constraining or facilitating factor that determines the extent of human development. Environmental change and conditions will therefore be the primary determinant of a person' or community' s capacity to adapt to their surroundings.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The extent of poverty within a population is the key factor in determining how environmental change affects human security, as it directly impacts their ability to adapt and cope with environmental challenges. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gender shapes the conceptualization of nationhood and conflict in many ways. Women are often excluded from traditional literature on war and security, but they frequently serve as symbols of national identity. The glorification of iconic national figures is not necessarily gendered, but women are often portrayed as nurturing and caring. Measures of national pride and success are biased towards the celebration of feminine attributes such as maternal characteristics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. National identity and conflict often portray feminine characteristics as being associated with violence, physical strength, and aggression, while masculinity is linked to domesticity and nurturing roles. This gendered division of labor creates a sense of national identity that is founded on the celebration of home life, feminine strength, and maternal characteristics.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are not directly involved in the global defence trade, as this is primarily a governmental activity. However, NGOs can play an important role in advocating for arms control measures and promoting transparency and accountability in the industry.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Non-governmental organizations lack the necessary resources and influence to effectively participate in controlling the global defense trade, leaving it primarily to governments and international organizations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Weak state insecurity represents an abnormal state in the historical trajectory of state-building, characterized by violence and a lack of centralized control over the means of coercion. This is not consistent with the established norms of international society which aim to prevent violent conflict from manifesting during the consolidation process.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Common structural adjustment policies often lead to increased costs for imports, including vital resources such as imported medicines. This puts even greater pressure on already stretched household budgets. Additionally, reduced health, education, and social welfare spending and the introduction of cost-recovery and user-fees put healthcare and education beyond the reach of many ordinary people. Public sector redundancies and salary freezes lead to fewer teachers and doctors. Massively increased unemployment with no social security provision push families deeper into poverty. Farmers and small companies can no longer afford to borrow money and are forced to reduce production or go out of business.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main impact of structural adjustment policies on the poor is the increased cost of imported goods, including essential items like medicine and food, which strains household budgets and exacerbates poverty. This is option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Securitization refers to the move of issues from a politicized state to a heightened state of politics beyond the normal political domain of decision-making activities. Once placed above the political sphere it cannot be returned to the public sphere, having been translated into a state interest above normal proceedings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Securitization involves moving an issue from the normal political realm to a heightened state of security concern, where it is treated as an existential threat and placed above regular political processes. This can be done through discourse that frames the issue in terms of urgency and priority.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) is a principle that states that the international community has a responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This includes preventing these atrocities from occurring in the first place, reacting when they do occur, remaining sovereign while doing so, and rebuilding after the fact.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The responsibility to protect encompasses the duty to react to ongoing humanitarian crises and intervene to protect populations from mass atrocities. It also includes the responsibility to prevent such crises from occurring in the first place, as well as the responsibility to rebuild after a crisis has occurred. However, sovereignty is not an element of the responsibility to protect; rather, it is a principle that states have the right to govern themselves without external interference.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A failure is an event that prevents the IT system from performing its intended function. In this case, all of the options listed are failures because they prevent the system from functioning properly.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 'Failure' in IT system threats refers to unforeseen events like natural disasters that disrupt or damage critical equipment, leading to system failure. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The state is the most prominent threat in terms of committing violent acts against humans, thus directly threatening human security. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In addressing human security, the primary focus should be on providing immediate relief and responding to current crises where people require urgent assistance from atrocities and suffering. The state has a crucial role in this process as it is the most prominent threat in terms of committing violent acts against humans, thus directly threatening human security. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. All the given options are economic tools for security policy, but only one is not directly related to trade or commerce. The odd one out is import restrictions to protect a domestic market from foreign goods.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Arms control, like other economic tools such as export controls and import restrictions, is used to achieve security policy objectives by regulating the flow of goods and technology. However, munitions and arms sales are not typically considered an economic tool for security policy. Therefore, the odd one out in this case is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A weak state is one that lacks the capacity to establish and maintain control over the instruments of violence, even within states with well-developed coercive power. This means that they are unable to enforce their authority and often face military intervention from other actors. The most appropriate answer is therefore A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Weak states maintain a monopoly on the use of force and possess the coercive capacity to enforce compliance, even when faced with resistance from social actors. The regime lacks popular legitimacy, but it is still able to rule due to its developed bureaucracy which legitimizes its ability to govern. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. All advocates of HM accept that social class is important. This statement is true, so option A is incorrect.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of social class is universally recognized as a crucial factor in understanding historical and societal dynamics within the framework of Historical Materialism. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first option is incorrect because different natures of adversaries complicate the use of Western coercion, but this does not mean that it cannot be used at all. The second option is correct because increased verification capabilities have made it harder to threaten or defeat an opponent's military strategy. The third option is incorrect because coalitional coercive diplomacy is not the only credible means for Western democracies to gain the sincerity required to make a threat of force real in the mind of the adversary, and there are other options available. Therefore, the correct answer must be D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main practical challenges of coercive diplomacy for Western nations lie in building effective coalitions and verifying compliance with agreements, often leading to inconclusive outcomes and difficulties in achieving desired results. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The weak state insecurity dilemma is an inescapable condition because it is a complex issue that cannot be solved through one solution. It requires a multifaceted approach, including political, economic and social reforms. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Weak states often implement long-term strategies like multi-party systems and economic liberalization to improve their security and gain international acceptance. However, these measures are not always successful in transforming weak states into strong ones. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A comprehensive national defence trade control system must include all the elements listed in the choices. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A comprehensive national defence trade control system primarily involves establishing clear laws and penalties for violations in arms trade. Additionally, marking weapons with a unique identifier can help track their origin and destination. Furthermore, governments should establish appropriate security measures to protect weapon stockpiles and destroy old or excess weaponry. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. The provision of security policy against terrorism is a problematic pursuit because it can lead to the erosion of civil liberties and human rights. It is important to strike a balance between protecting citizens from terrorist threats and preserving their fundamental freedoms.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The main problem with counter-terrorism efforts is the potential for governments to overreach and infringe upon civil liberties in the name of security. This can lead to a slippery slope where personal freedoms are sacrificed in the pursuit of victory, which may not be worth it in the long run.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Modern human rights oriented liberalism is concerned with self-determination. This means that it supports the right of people to determine their own political status and freely pursue their economic, social, cultural, and political development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The core principle of human rights-oriented liberalism is the right of all people to self-determination and autonomy. This means that they should be free from any form of oppression or discrimination, including economic, sexual, gender, religious, and political persecution. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sanctions are a tool used by the international community to exert economic pressure on countries that violate human rights, engage in aggressive behavior or pose a threat to regional or global security. The goal of sanctions is not only to punish these regimes but also to encourage them to change their behavior and policies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sanctions are primarily used as a tool to exert economic pressure and encourage states to adopt policies that promote peace and freedom. They can also be used to end economic support for morally unacceptable regimes, isolate dangerous regimes, and weaken threats to regional or global security.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Extraordinary measures are those taken as a response to an exceptional or extraordinary situation, such as a national security threat. This is not necessarily the use of force or violence, but rather a deviation from normal political processes and procedures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Extraordinary measures are those actions taken by states in response to perceived existential threats, often outside the normal bounds of political action. This definition is broad enough to encompass all of the given choices.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. Fission nuclear weapons are gun-type devices that require a relatively small amount of fissile uranium-235 material to produce a comparatively large explosion because mass and energy become interchangeable in the barrel. Implosion devices however are unable to sustain the reaction; the neutron generator is unable to set off the interchange being destroyed in the explosion.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Gun-type fission weapons are highly efficient due to the direct conversion of mass to energy in the barrel, requiring minimal fissile material for a large explosion. Implosion devices however require more complex mechanisms and materials, making them less efficient.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aid can be used as an economic policy for security in a variety of ways, including to reward recipients for the cessation of negative behaviour, incentivise them to act in ways beneficial to the donor, and influence them through granting or denying aid. However, it is not typically used out of compassion for human suffering.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A primary motivation for using aid as an economic policy for security is to incentivize recipient states to adopt policies that align with the donor's interests. This can be achieved through various means, such as providing financial incentives or imposing sanctions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first criticism of HM is that it pays insufficient attention to the role of the labourer, instead focusing on the capitalist as the source of power and most important actor. This can be seen in the way that HM tends to view labour as a passive force that must be exploited for profit. The second criticism is that HM too often accuses capitalism of acting solely in self-serving ways, and explains everything in terms of class struggle, to the detriment of wider analysis. This can lead to an oversimplification of complex social phenomena. The third criticism is that some versions of HM claim to have uncovered objective laws of history which are widely disputed in their accuracy. Finally, all of these options could be seen as criticisms of HM.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism is often criticized for its reductionist view of capitalism, focusing solely on its negative aspects and ignoring its complexities. It also tends to overlook the role of the labourer in capitalist power structures, instead emphasizing the importance of the capitalist as the source of power. HM can allude to capitalist power structures, but it should not do so at the expense of supporting the human security of workers.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Feminist and critical security investigations of the 1990s and 2000s have expanded our understanding of gender security issues in a number of ways. Firstly, they have shown us that war can have gendered consequences, which has allowed us to address the way in which we think about 'male' and 'female' expectations in warfare. Secondly, these theories have shaped the way in which we theorise, participate, and protest against those roles. Finally, feminist and critical security theory shows us that women are increasingly subject to violence as a product of social circumstance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While feminist and critical security studies have highlighted gendered consequences of security issues, they haven't fundamentally challenged core concepts of international relations theory, such as the state's role as the primary actor in security. However, these theories have allowed us to better understand how war can affect women differently than men.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Resilience in cyber-security is a measure of how well an IT system can withstand and recover from attacks, threats or failures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In cyber-security, resilience primarily refers to an IT system's ability to identify and defend against cyber threats, ensuring its continued operation. The other options are not accurate definitions of the term.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Option A is correct because it describes a key event that led to the emergence of environmental security during the 1990s and 2000s - namely, the critique of orthodox security discourse and practices by scholars who highlighted their inability to manage environmental risks.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of environmental security in the 1960s and 1970s was largely driven by a shared environmental consciousness that emerged in developed countries facing environmental challenges. This consciousness led to increased awareness about the risks posed by environmental changes, which in turn prompted scholars to critique orthodox security discourse and practices.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Biological differences between the sexes can have a significant impact on how they perform their roles for the state. In particular, women's reproductive responsibilities and intimate relationships are often seen as more important than political or religious duties. This is because biology determines that women must bear children in order to ensure the survival of the species. As such, men are often expected to protect and care for women and their offspring.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Due to biological differences, men are naturally suited for roles within state security apparatuses, while women are better equipped for caregiving and nurturing roles. This is because the female body is weaker than the male body, which makes it more vulnerable in conflict situations.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism argues that security can be constructed, and that the human world is not given or natural but instead is a product of human actors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism examines the 'natural' systems and hierarchies within societies that shape the international system and define its values. It is not concerned with issues of poverty, race relations and gender, but rather focuses on how these societal constructs influence security.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first three statements all describe the nature of societal groups, while the last one is a generalization that does not fit with the others.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The characteristic that sets societal groups apart is their nature as multiple-identity units, encompassing diverse individuals with overlapping identities and affiliations. This distinguishes them from other social entities such as families or communities.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is correct as it describes how diseases can affect people regardless of their background or status. The second statement is also true, but not the main focus of this question. The third statement is partially true, but pandemics are more complex and multifaceted than terrorism. The fourth statement is false, as there have been many instances where international mechanisms failed to contain pandemic outbreaks.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While pandemics pose a significant threat to national security, their impact is primarily confined within national borders and doesn't substantially affect wider international stability. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks us about the relationship between realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 2000s. We know that both groups were active during this time, but they had different approaches to studying international relations. Realists focused on military strength as a means of achieving security, while peace researchers looked beyond weapons for solutions. This led to tensions between the two groups.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both realist international relations theorists and peace researchers in the early 1960s shared a concern about the escalating arms race and advocated for the elimination of the Soviet nuclear threat to ensure the survival of Western democracies. However, there were differences between the two groups in terms of their proposed solutions to this crisis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Post-structuralists believe that security is a social construct, shaped by language, power relations, and ideology. Therefore, the most important impact of security studies would be to create and perpetuate claims about what constitutes security, who has access to it, and how it should be achieved.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important impact of security studies lies in its contribution to the academic literature and theoretical understanding of security issues, furthering knowledge and research in the field. This is because post-structuralists believe that security studies should not be limited to a narrow focus on military threats but rather encompass broader social, economic, and political dimensions.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism is an optimistic approach, offering an orientation for the better conduct of international affairs in the belief that a more peaceful world is possible. It is the dominant conception in the practice of international politics.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism, as a dominant theory in international politics, takes a pessimistic view of the international system, emphasizing the inevitability of conflict and power struggles between states. It is not an optimistic approach that defines how states should relate to one another during conflict situations.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A revolution in military affairs is a wholesale shift in the way warfare is conducted and understood, not necessarily due to a specific event or technology. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Schelling's necessary conditions for compellence success are the following: (1) The coercer must not unduly threaten the adversary, (2) threat must be credible, (3) adversary must recognise the legitimacy of coercer's demands, (4) coercer must assure adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands, and (5) conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game. Option A is incorrect because it does not include all necessary conditions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Schelling's conditions for compellence success involve making the adversary comply with demands. Using military intervention as a threat would be too extreme and counterproductive. The coercer must also assure the adversary that compliance will not lead to future demands, which is why option D is incorrect. Finally, the conflict must not be perceived as a zero-sum game, so options A and B are both incorrect.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first trend that emerged was a shift from private to government control over the defence trade, which is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If there are more types of weapons being traded, it means the market is diversifying and therefore the overall volume of trade must be decreasing. This is not the case here as we see a growth in the number and variety of weapons traded.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism is a theory that explains how social change occurs through changes in the mode of production. It has been used to explain many historical events and movements, including the global justice movement. The relationship between these two concepts is complex, but it can be argued that historical materialism provides a useful framework for understanding the economic and political forces that shape our world.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism focuses on the material conditions of society and how they shape history. Neo-liberalism also emphasizes material progress and economic growth, so they share similar goals. However, neo-liberalism is more concerned with deregulation and privatization than with social justice or equality.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Post-structuralist critique is a theoretical framework that challenges traditional ways of understanding power, subjectivity and knowledge. In the context of security studies, it enables us to understand the workings of political subjecthoods left out of traditional discourses on security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Post-structuralism is concerned with deconstructing power structures and dominant narratives. In security studies, this means questioning the idea that technology alone determines security outcomes. Instead, it focuses on how political subjecthoods are constructed and left out of traditional discourses on security.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Security in the contemporary world can be defined as a state of being free from threats and dangers that could harm individuals or groups. It is important to note that security is not just about physical safety, but also includes economic, social, and political stability. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lippman's definition of security, which focuses on a nation's ability to defend its core values through war, aligns with the traditional state-centric view of security that dominated early Security Studies. Bellamy's definition, however, emphasizes the importance of avoiding war and maintaining peace as a means of achieving security. Booth's definition takes a more holistic approach by linking security to emancipation, which refers to the liberation of individuals and groups from physical and human constraints. This perspective highlights the interconnectedness between security and social justice issues.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks us to identify the differences between conventional and critical constructivism. We can see that option A is incorrect because it describes how both approaches benefit from each other, while option B is also incorrect as it states that critical constructivism regards the strength of social constructivism in bridging rationalist and reflectivist approaches. Option C is correct because it accurately identifies the differences between conventional and critical constructivism. Finally, option D is incorrect because it does not address the question at hand.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Social constructivism emphasizes the role of social interactions and shared understandings in shaping identities and security. While there may be some variations within the field, the core principles remain consistent. Critical constructivists challenge these theories, embracing positivist methodologies in their work.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. WMD terrorism poses a security threat that is not easily met by today'S policy community or military establishments. The second strike rule is virtually obsolete because of the difficulty of locating such groups and deterrence is an unviable strategy given that objective of attacks are frequently politically, ideologically or religiously motivated.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While the CWC and BCW may have limitations in enforcement, they still provide a valuable framework for international cooperation and diplomacy in preventing the spread of chemical and biological weapons. The Proliferation Security Initiative is also an important tool for identifying and intercepting illicit trade in WMD materials. As for the future of WMD, it is clear that state actors seeking to develop their own capabilities have destabilized norms governing their use and control.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The initial development of peace studies was a social-sciences area of study, and it wasn't until later in the twentieth century that journals became an important feature of the field.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Peace studies, as an interdisciplinary field, draws on insights from various disciplines, including mathematics and natural sciences, to understand and promote peace. The creation of journals was not a prominent feature of the field until late in the twentieth century, so statement B cannot be applied to the initial development of peace studies.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy is hard because it relies on the adversary's perception that their vital interests are threatened, which can be difficult to achieve. Moreover, actors engaging in such behaviour are unlikely to perceive issues as zero-sum and regard them as a win-lose situation. As a consequence coercive diplomacy can lead to lengthy resolution discussions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Coercive diplomacy involves using threats and pressure to achieve desired outcomes. This approach leaves ample space for negotiation and finding common ground with the adversary. However, it also carries inherent difficulties such as the risk of escalation, misperception or miscalculation, and the potential for unlimited political scope. In no-win situations therefore the adversary might calculate that temporary compliance is the best strategic option to buy time.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a complex phenomenon that has multiple causes and factors. In this analysis, we will focus on four main causes of terrorism: democratization and nationalism, ethnocentrism and secularism, capitalist market activities and technological revolutions, and non-democratic state structures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Democracies and strong national identities offer channels for peaceful expression and conflict resolution, reducing the likelihood of resorting to terrorism. In contrast, non-democratic states with repressive methods create an environment where popular discontent can be channeled into terrorist activities.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a broad concept that is understood to denote the threat or use of organized violence for the attainment of political objectives. The definition may therefore be inclusive of governments as targets or perpetrators and cases of war (hot and cold) where terror and counter-terror measures are tactics of either side.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism involves the use of violence to achieve political objectives. This includes acts like kidnapping and organized crime, which can be used to exert political pressure or gain concessions. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The global energy environment has had a significant impact on the security of oil producing states. In order to secure the continuation of supplies from these nations, states in the North have utilised their diplomatic influence to bolster human security, promoting the growth of strong liberal democratic regimes that can operate securely on the free market.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Northern states, concerned with securing oil supplies, often support human security initiatives and democratic reforms in oil-producing countries to foster stability and cooperation. This is because they believe that these regimes are more likely to operate on the free market and provide reliable energy sources.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The defence trade is a complex phenomenon involving multiple actors, including state and non-state entities. While military organisations are certainly involved, they do not represent the only actors in this field.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The defence trade refers to the exchange of military equipment and technology between countries. This primarily involves government-to-government deals for legitimate defense purposes. However, non-state actors can also be involved in this trade, including illegal groups that sell weapons on the black market.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The most obvious issue of joint concern during the 2000s was terror and order, although fast- rising concerns over environmental/climate security could easily provide another big linking issue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies in the 21st century must prioritize understanding and responding to the evolving threat of terrorism and maintaining global order. However, it is also important for security studies to address other pressing issues such as environmental/climate security, which could provide a major linking issue. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Societal security is a concept that refers to the protection and preservation of social structures, institutions, and values from external threats or internal challenges. It encompasses various dimensions such as economic, political, environmental, and cultural aspects. Therefore, all of these options are essential to societal security.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Societal security depends on a shared sense of identity and belonging within a society. A dominant ethnic group can provide a unifying force and contribute to social cohesion. However, this does not necessarily mean that hegemonic ethnicity is essential for societal security.",C

This can include everything from hacking into government systems to stealing personal information for financial gain.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Cyber-crime encompasses any illegal activity that involves computers and networks. This primarily focuses on stealing data, such as personal information or intellectual property. The most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The traditional conception of security studies emphasizes the role of military power in shaping international politics. Therefore, it can be inferred that military security is a central concern within this tradition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Strategic studies, as a subfield of international relations, examines the use of military force to achieve political objectives. Military security is a central focus within strategic studies, addressing issues of war, deterrence, and defense strategies. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The USA is a major player in global politics, particularly when it comes to energy security. It has deployed troops in the Persian Gulf as part of its strategy to secure dominance in the region and protect its economic interests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The USA's energy security strategy prioritizes maintaining stability in oil-producing regions and supporting friendly governments to ensure a reliable flow of oil resources.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The period of academic institutionalization can be assessed in different ways, depending on one's perspective and criteria. One possible way is to look at the emergence and development of specific fields or disciplines that are related to security studies, such as strategic studies, peace research, or critical theory. Another possible way is to examine the role and influence of think tanks, which are organizations that conduct research and provide advice on various issues, including security. A third possible way is to analyze the debates and controversies within the academic community about the nature, purpose, and limits of security studies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies and peace research emerged as distinct academic fields with separate research agendas and methodologies. While both address issues of conflict and security, they approach the subject matter from different perspectives. The answer that best reflects this distinction is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The post-Cold War security literature has revealed that technological advancements have not resolved all gender issues in warfare. While the battlefield may be gender neutral in terms of its destructive capabilities, there are still many other aspects of war that can affect women differently than men. For example, women may face different forms of violence or discrimination during conflict, and post-conflict reconstruction efforts may not always address these issues adequately.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If technology has eliminated physical threats to women in war, then the remaining gender divide must be based on 'soft' issues like physical and biological vulnerabilities. This is supported by the fact that the contemporary gender divide is structured on socio-economic hardship.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Critical Security Studies is a theoretical framework that challenges the traditional understanding of security as being solely about protecting the state from external threats. Instead, it argues that security should be understood in terms of how power relations are constructed and maintained within society. In this case, the most appropriate answer is the people and their collectives.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Given the growing concerns about climate change and resource depletion, it's logical to assume that the environment is the primary referent object of security within Critical Security Studies. However, this doesn't mean that other actors such as states or people are not important. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Washington Consensus is a set of economic policies that were promoted in the late 1980s and early 1990s to help developing countries achieve sustainable growth. These policies included fiscal discipline, tax reform, property rights, deregulation, trade liberalization, privatization, monetary stability, and financial sector reforms. Nationalization was not one of these steps.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Washington Consensus emphasizes free-market principles, so protecting property rights, including state enterprises, aligns with its goals. Fiscal discipline and tax reform are also important components of the consensus, but nationalization is not a part of it.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a serious threat to global security and has been increasing in recent years. The distinction between domestic and international attacks is important as it can affect the scale of force employed in terrorist operations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The key distinction in terrorist activity lies in the objectives: domestic terrorism aims to remove government figures, while international terrorism has broader ideological goals. Statistics show that instances of domestic terrorism are decreasing, but international occurrences can be ten times higher in terms of injuries and deaths due to the larger scale of force employed.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument made by Braun and Chyba (2004) is that indigenous nuclear programs are making proliferation safeguards obsolete. This means that the current system of international non-proliferation treaties, which aim to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, may no longer be effective in preventing countries from developing their own nuclear capabilities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While the proliferation of nuclear weapons to terrorists is a serious concern, it's the difficulty of constructing such weapons that makes safeguards still relevant. WMD vary vastly in terms of their availability, lethality, and destructive potential and the ease with which they can be manufactured. This means that the potential threats posed by each type of weapon are different. High yield, lightweight nuclear weapons use cutting-edge technology, whilst some chemical and biological weapons have been available for a long time. What separates WMD from conventional weapons is the potential to cause high level destruction. Because of the psychological fear possession can generate, WMD will remain highly desirable as a political weapon.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Malware is a term used to describe malicious software that can harm or exploit computer systems and networks. A virus or worm is one type of malware, but it is not the only one. A Trojan horse is another type of malware, but it is also not the only one. A hacker tool is a general term for any device or program that hackers use to gain unauthorized access or control over a system or network. A corrupted program is a type of malware, but it is not the only one. Based on these definitions, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Malware often leads to corrupted programs and data loss, so it's reasonable to consider it a corrupted program itself. However, malware can also be used as a tool for hackers or viruses/worms, which makes the answer A incorrect.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism is a theoretical framework that examines the effects of colonialism on societies and cultures, particularly in terms of power relations and social structures. One of its key concepts is violence, which can take different forms depending on the context. Material violence refers to physical harm or destruction, epistemic violence refers to the manipulation or distortion of knowledge and information, and pervasive violence refers to systemic oppression and discrimination. Structural violence, however, is a more subtle form of violence that operates at the level of social structures and institutions, perpetuating inequality and injustice without necessarily involving direct aggression or coercion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Structural violence refers to the systemic ways in which social structures can harm individuals, so it essentially encompasses all forms of violence, making 'pervasive violence' the most fitting term. Epistemic violence is a form of violence that occurs when knowledge and power are used to oppress others, but it does not encompass all forms of violence. Material violence refers to physical acts of aggression, which is also one of the forms of violence identified by postcolonialism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Given that industrial development is correlated to energy consumption, it can be inferred that developed states are likely to continue increasing their demands for energy. This is balanced by a lesser demand from developing states due to their lack of industrialisation; however, the future prospects for energy security in the North remain uncertain as data indicates that consumption levels have peaked and are not expected to increase.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With advancements in alternative energy and better resource management, we can ensure sufficient energy supply despite increasing global demand. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism is a political ideology that advocates for individual freedom, equality and cooperation among nations. However, some governments are reluctant to fully embrace this ideology due to various reasons. One of the most common reasons is the fear that liberal values may be imposed on them by more powerful states or international organizations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The reluctance of some regimes to embrace liberalism stems from the fear that Western ideologies will dominate and impose their values on others, resembling a form of modern imperialism. This is not a valid reason for this reluctance.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nuclear deterrence has been a source of stability during the Cold War, but there is no consensus on its impact post-Cold War. Proliferation pessimists argue that new states' development programs do not provide sufficient guarantees that the state sponsors will act as good custodians. Weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives. Domestic pressures may result in a regime gravitating towards nuclear war fighting strategies to win a rapid victory and strengthen status.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nuclear deterrence promotes stability by ensuring retaliation capabilities, thus discouraging aggression and maintaining a balance of power. However, proliferation pessimists argue that the spread of nuclear weapons to non-state actors would be fundamentally detrimental to international security based on the recognition that existing deterrence strategies and capabilities do not address the use of nuclear weapons. Furthermore, weak state structures might result in sabotage, accidental use, or even theft. There is also the problem of states developing technology under the guise of deterrence whilst having ulterior motives.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Cold War was a time when there were two major superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, who had a lot of power and influence over other countries. During this time, military security became very important because both sides wanted to be able to protect themselves from each other. After the Cold War ended, things changed and people started thinking about other types of security like environmental and personal security.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies have always encompassed a wide range of subjects, including human security and economic security, alongside military concerns. However, after the Cold War, there was an increased focus on environmental and personal security as well.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The realist argument against humanitarian intervention is based on several key assumptions, including that states will always prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others and that sovereignty should be respected at all costs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Realists oppose humanitarian intervention because they believe states have the primary responsibility to protect their own citizens, making external intervention unnecessary. However, critics argue that this position overlooks the responsibilities inherent in sovereignty and the wide body of international law relating to basic human rights and the consensus on grave crimes such as genocide.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the end of the Cold War, there have been significant changes in the geopolitical environment that have influenced the use of coercive diplomacy by Western powers. The favourable geo-political environment characterized by an overwhelmingly Western military superiority and a low risk of hostile great power intervention has generated pressures and incentives for Western policymakers to promote their policy agenda, and to manage armed conflicts from weak states and failing states. This has led to a shift in focus towards the use of force rather than diplomacy or incentives.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The end of the Cold War hasn't eliminated the threat of large-scale conflict, with new dangers like terrorism and WMD proliferation requiring forceful responses from Western powers. This has led to a shift in policy towards coercive diplomacy.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Institutional constraints refer to tools of the state such as schools, prisons, and hospitals; the provision of resources for these institutions makes demands on political leaders.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Institutional constraints shape behavior by influencing an actor's goals and ambitions through established social norms and expectations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Cold War Security Studies have been dominated by two main approaches or perspectives. The first one is an examination of the social processes by which groups of people construct something as a threat, such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and transnational organized crime. This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding how these threats are constructed and perceived in different contexts. The second perspective focuses on peace-making, peacekeeping, and conflict prevention as priorities for avoiding military confrontations. This approach emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes of conflicts and promoting dialogue and cooperation among states and other actors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Cold War Security Studies prioritizes maintaining a stable distribution of power among states to ensure security and prevent conflict, aligning with the realist perspective. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Environmental security is a relatively new concept that has been contested in various ways. One way it has been challenged is through its focus on the ecological integrity of the whole system, which some argue radically challenges traditional security thinking. Another way is through its emphasis on systemic interdependence and global responsibility for environmental problems.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ecological security, like traditional security approaches, prioritizes the security of the state, focusing on protecting its environment and resources. However, it challenges this approach by arguing that environmental problems are global in nature and require a shift from national to international cooperation.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Biological agents can be weaponized, but their effectiveness depends on several factors such as storage, delivery, and mode of transmission. Military professionals believe that the majority of biological agents can be sufficiently stable in their effects to be used as a weapon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Biological agents are highly effective weapons due to their stability, minimal resource requirements, and lethal effects, making them attractive for military purposes. However, the means of transmission is also important as it can be difficult to contain an outbreak. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Liberalism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, as well as free trade and cooperation between nations. It has been widely adopted around the world, but it also faces several limitations. One of these is its difficulty in defining when the use of force would be justified or necessary. This can lead to confusion and inconsistency in international relations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A major limitation of the liberalist approach is the challenge of determining when the use of force is justified, leading to ambiguity in its application. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Security is a complex concept that can be defined in many ways. However, it generally refers to the ability to protect oneself and one's interests from harm or danger.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Security primarily refers to the capability to prevent or overcome aggression, ensuring freedom from war and the protection of the state. Option A is incorrect because security does not necessarily mean coercion. Option B is also incorrect as it focuses on safety rather than preventing attacks. Option C is partially correct but does not encompass all aspects of security. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Option A is incorrect because it is not self-evident that individuals do have universal and fundamental human rights. This is a common misconception, but the Universal Declaration of Human Rights clearly states that all humans are born free and equal in dignity and rights.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The main limitation of humanitarian intervention lies in the lack of a universal agreement on using force to protect human rights, making its justification and implementation challenging. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of hegemonic masculinity refers to the social dominance of men over women, which results from the designation of 'masculine' characteristics as more valued than 'feminine' characteristics.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hegemonic masculinity sounds like it has something to do with harmony, and harmony is often associated with feminine characteristics like cooperation and nurturing. However, the definition given in option B suggests that hegemonic masculinity is actually a form of social dominance where men are seen as superior to women because they possess certain traits deemed more valuable by society. This aligns with the concept of gender inequality.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The liberalist perspective is based on the idea that free trade, open markets, and limited government intervention are essential for economic growth and prosperity. However, recent events have shown that this view may not hold true in all cases. For example, the global economic crisis has revealed the failure of international cooperation to prevent a global catastrophe, as well as the need for greater regulation and oversight of key industries. Additionally, some governments have responded to the crisis by increasing state involvement in key sectors, which could be seen as a challenge to liberalist ideals. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The global economic crisis clearly demonstrated a lack of international cooperation and coordination, leading to a massive economic collapse that impacted numerous countries. This failure highlights the limitations of liberalist perspectives in addressing complex global challenges.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for techniques and targets that belong to a workable definition of terrorism and terrorist concerns. We can eliminate option D because it includes all the given options, which are not necessarily related to each other.",A,"Let's reason step by step. WMDs haven't been used much by terrorists, they prefer more conventional methods. So, the threat of WMDs seems less relevant to understanding terrorism. Suicide attacks are a common tactic for terrorists and can be combined with other weapons. Weak non-democratic countries provide conditions conducive to terrorist activity. Therefore, all options belong to a workable definition of terrorism.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Commission on Human Security was launched with the objective of promoting public understanding, engagement and support of human security and its underlying imperatives.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the Commission wants to promote public understanding and support for human security, it naturally follows that they would need to establish a new international justice system to enforce it effectively. This is not one of their stated objectives.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Waltz argues that states are rational actors who seek to maximize their security, which is defined as the ability to protect themselves from attack. He proposes two main ways of achieving this goal: internal and external balancing. Internal balancing refers to a state's efforts to increase its power relative to other states in order to deter potential aggressors. External balancing involves forming alliances with other states that can provide mutual security guarantees. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Waltz is a realist, and realists believe that states achieve security by acquiring more resources and territory to strengthen their defense capabilities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. Offensive realism defines the international system as an environment in which states seek to achieve security through the acquisition of power.,D,"Let's reason step by step. Offensive realism argues that states seek security by acquiring power, while defensive realism focuses on cooperation as the means to achieve security. So, the statement about both involving power and competition is incorrect. The correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. All of these threats are common in weak states, but coup d\u00e9tat is the most unusual one because it involves a violent overthrow of the government by its own military forces. The other three options are more likely to occur due to external factors such as war or refugee influx.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A sudden influx of refugees can be seen as a form of external intervention, similar to a coup d'état, where external forces disrupt the existing power structure and create instability within the state. Warlordism and the assertion of criminal gangs are also forms of internal disruption that threaten the stability of weak states. However, competition for authoritative power or coercion from strongmen is more of an ongoing struggle rather than a sudden event like a coup d'état.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The referent object in contemporary cyber-security is the entity that needs to be protected from cyber threats. This could include digitalised sensitive information, critical Information Infrastructures, government IT systems or telecommunication networks. However, the most appropriate answer is Critical Information Infrastructures as they are essential for national security and economic stability.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Cyber-security has always been about protecting communication networks like the internet and telecommunication infrastructure from attacks and disruptions. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards protecting digitalised sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, and intellectual property. This is because cybercriminals are increasingly targeting these types of assets to steal money or cause damage. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Classical economics, as it developed in the 18th century, was heavily influenced by mercantilist thought. Mercantilists believed that the purpose of a state's economy was to accumulate wealth and power through trade. This led them to advocate for policies such as tariffs and subsidies to promote exports and limit imports. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mercantilism aimed to increase a nation's wealth, which would naturally lead to greater security and prosperity for its citizens. This was achieved through policies such as tariffs, subsidies, and the establishment of colonies.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Peace studies is a field of study that focuses on conflict resolution, economic security, and the cessation of violence at both an international and sub-national level. It differs from development studies and international relations in its research agenda.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peace studies has evolved into a distinct and self-contained field, separate from areas like development studies and international relations, with its own unique approach to understanding and resolving conflict. This is best defined as the 'top-down' approach that prioritizes the issues surrounding violence and the use of force.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of health as a security issue has changed significantly during the twentieth century. In the early 20th century, there was growing recognition of the potential threat of pandemic disease outbreaks in the newly globalised world. This led to an increased sense of panic and fear about the potential damage that such outbreaks could cause. However, medical advances and successful contained outbreaks have largely allayed these fears. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Health, especially concerns about pandemics, has always been a major security issue. While there were advancements in medicine, the fear of widespread disease outbreaks has remained a constant concern throughout the 20th century. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Liberal perspective on future energy security is that the global economy is interconnected, ensuring that energy security for one is dependent upon energy security for all. Thus all core powers have the same interests in maintaining and extending the conditions under which this market operates. As long as this economic order exists, conflict between major powers over energy reserves is highly unlikely.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Energy security is crucial for maintaining the existing global order, which benefits those in power. As long as the flow of energy resources continues to support their position, they will ensure its security. Thus, a liberal perspective on future energy security would be that it is unlikely to lead to conflict between major powers.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism is a theory that explains the development of human society through economic factors, particularly the ownership and control of resources. It was developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their work 'The Communist Manifesto'. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Historical materialism deals with economic and social structures, so it must be based on the ideas of both Adam Smith, who focused on capitalism, and Karl Marx, who critiqued it. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The realist case against humanitarian inventions argues that foreign intervention is not effective and can even make things worse. It also asserts that armed force should only ever be used in the national interest, which means that humanitarian intervention is imprudent.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Realists believe that military force should only serve national interests. Therefore, they would oppose humanitarian interventions as they are not directly related to national security. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of 'victim' has a significant impact on how gender security is regarded. In 1990, it was estimated that 90% of war casualties were civilian, the majority women and children. This narrative has contributed to the enduring perception that women are dependent on men for protection, and that men are responsible for sacrificing their own well-being for the sake of protecting women and the state (often confused with one another through propaganda and imagery). Reports that women are the primary casualties of war have also led to a growing perception that those who fight are courageous and heroic, whilst those who do not take on female characteristics. However, increasing awareness regarding the barbaric nature of warfare and the problems of trauma in war has led to a reversal in the belief that the idea of war is a natural place for males. In contemporary societies across the globe, men are regarded as the victims of gender stereotypes that coerce them into violent behaviour as 'protectors' or aggressors on behalf of the state.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  As we become more aware of the horrors of war and the trauma it inflicts, the perception of men as warriors has shifted. Men are now often seen as victims of societal pressures that force them into violent roles. This is a significant change from previous generations where men were expected to be strong and brave in battle.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'stability' in the context of energy security refers to a political and economic situation in which the status quo of production, exportation and supply is maintained. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stability in oil production is mainly about ensuring the security of regimes friendly to Western interests and oil companies, as they rely on a steady supply of oil. The absence of challenges to the regime of oil-producing states (option A) or maintaining the status quo of production, exportation and supply (option B) are both related to stability but not defining it. Promoting human security and environmental security is important for the long-term sustainability of oil production, but it does not define stability.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Corporate identity refers to the set of values, beliefs, and practices that define a company or organization. Social identity, on the other hand, is how individuals perceive themselves in relation to others. Actors can have multiple social identities, but they may only have one corporate identity.",A,Let's reason step by step.  Corporate identity is just one type of social identity that actors develop through their interactions and relationships with other actors in the international system. Social identity refers to 'sets of meanings' that an actor attributes to itself while taking the perspective of others. Actors can have multiple social identities.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Constructivism is an approach to international relations that emphasizes the role of ideas and norms in shaping state behavior. It has been criticized for lacking empirical evidence, rationalist foundations, and neglecting internationalization in a globalized world. However, it does not reject causality but rather replaces material triggers with ideas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Constructivism emphasizes the state as the primary actor in international relations, which doesn't fit well with the current globalized world where non-state actors and transnational issues are increasingly important. This criticism is valid.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gender security is an emerging field that seeks to understand how gender relations and power dynamics impact issues related to security, including war, conflict, and militarization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gender security is simply an expansion of traditional security thinking to include women, who were previously excluded from the male-dominated sphere of national and military security. This means that gender security is not just about including women in combat roles but also about addressing issues related to human security.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism emerged as a critical response to the legacy of colonialism, which was characterized by the domination and exploitation of colonized peoples and nations by Western powers. Security studies, on the other hand, is concerned with the study of power relations between states and non-state actors in the international system. While there are some minor differences between these two fields, they share a common interest in understanding how power operates in the world. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Postcolonialism is separate from security studies because it only focuses on the well-being of nations that were once under colonial rule, while security studies deals with broader international security concerns. However, postcolonialism shares some similarities with traditional security studies in its view of the international system and world powers. Additionally, postcolonialism rejects the concept of power that is central to within security studies and questions the standard Westphalian account of world history that is the basis for security studies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies emerged as an academic field in relation to the interests of the USA and Britain following the Second World War, when they were actively involved in imperial relations with other countries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Security studies, as a field, originated in the post-World War II era, primarily driven by the interests of the USA and Britain. This is evident from the fact that the first academic conference on security studies was held at Harvard University in 1946, with the participation of scholars from these two countries.",A
B,Let's reason step by step. Societies are threatened when their linguistic heritage and traditions are under attack. The inability to use and develop traditional language signifies the destruction of a society.,A,"Let's reason step by step. A society faces a significant threat when its cultural heritage, especially its language and traditions, are under attack or at risk of disappearing. This is because the ability to use and develop traditional languages signifies the survival of a society.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The traditional concept of national security has been defined as the protection of a nation's borders, sovereignty and territorial integrity from external threats. This definition is limited to military and political concerns, and does not take into account non-military or human-related issues such as poverty, disease, environmental degradation, and social injustice. In contrast, human security focuses on protecting individuals from these types of threats.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of human security, the primary concern lies in safeguarding human life, upholding human rights, and preserving human dignity. The traditional concept of national security is more focused on protecting a nation's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political stability from external threats. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Desecuritization is the process of removing a threat from the realm of security and returning it to the domain of politics or everyday life. This process has several important reasons, including preventing the erosion of established civil liberties through the removal of special rights and the cessation of extraordinary measures.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Desecuritization is crucial because it allows actors to effectively address emerging existential threats by employing extraordinary measures when necessary. It also prevents the securitization of irrelevant or non-urgent issues, which can lead to the erosion of established civil liberties and the cessation of special rights.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Strategic circumstances have a significant impact on environmental security perspectives. In the end of the Cold War, there was an increased awareness of environmental issues and multilateralism in policy action. This led to a re-considered approach to security policy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 1973 OPEC oil embargo highlighted the vulnerability of industrialized nations to disruptions in energy supply, prompting a focus on securing energy resources and linking environmental concerns to military and diplomatic strategies. This event had a profound psychological impact that led to a re-evaluation of security policy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about HM's development during and since the Cold War, so we need to look at how it was received in each period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Human security (HM) gained significant traction during the Cold War and has since become a well-established and widely accepted paradigm within security studies. This is evidenced by its inclusion in mainstream security dialogue, as well as its growing prominence in academic research.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about strategies that elites employ, so we can eliminate options A and B which are not related to elites. Option C seems like it could be the correct answer because private military or security companies and foreign mercenaries are often employed by elites to secure their interests. However, option D also mentions weak states engaging in action to bolster their regional position and mobilize internal support against an imagined external threat, so we cannot definitively say that option C is the correct answer. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To consolidate their position, weak states often resort to military actions aimed at bolstering their regional standing and rallying internal support against perceived external threats, especially during economic or social crises. This is the most appropriate answer.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of 'human security' has gained increasing currency in the mid-1990s, serving to highlight critical issues. In particular, the study of human society has focused on the problem of intra-state violence, which has become the dominant issue for post-Cold War security studies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of human security gained significant prominence in the mid-1990s, effectively shifting the focus of security studies towards intra-state violence as the primary concern in the post-Cold War era. This shift was driven by a recognition that traditional state-centric arguments were insufficient to address the security needs of individuals within states.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The IMF's primary goal is to promote global economic stability, which it does through providing financial assistance to countries facing balance-of-payments problems. Adjustment policies are designed to help these countries achieve macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. These policies typically involve a combination of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at reducing inflation, promoting exports, and limiting the growth of government debt.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The primary economic goals of IMF adjustment policies revolve around implementing tighter monetary and credit policies, often involving higher interest rates, to curb overall demand and inflation, thereby reducing the need for imports. Additionally, devaluation can be a strategy to promote exports and reduce import demand by raising their prices. Public spending cuts are also common in these policies as they aim to reduce the budget deficit and slow down government debt growth.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Gender is a social construct that influences how individuals perceive themselves and others, as well as their access to resources and opportunities. In Security Studies, gender can be relevant in understanding the ways in which different groups are affected by security threats, as well as the roles they play in protecting the state or referent object. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To achieve a truly gender-neutral security environment, it's essential to disregard gender-related issues and focus solely on security concerns that are universally applicable. However, this is not the case in reality, as social constructions of 'masculinity' or 'femininity' do play an important role in determining the roles men and women are expected to act in. This can have a significant impact on how we conceptualize security issues.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The state-centric approach to security has been defined as a school of thought that prioritizes the security of the state over other referent objects such as individuals or populations. This is in contrast to human security, which defines the referent object as the person or population and focuses on protecting their interests. Therefore, it can be concluded that there are significant differences between these two approaches.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the state-centric and human security approaches offer comprehensive frameworks for understanding the international security landscape, and it's up to security analysts to determine which one is more appropriate and discard the other. The most appropriate answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The security dimensions of infectious disease can be considered in the national security framework in several ways. First, the physical health of armed forces is a paramount concern within the traditional security paradigm, and the threat of disease is exacerbated by the physical and sociological conditions under which military personal operate, particularly during combat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Within the traditional security paradigm, the primary concern regarding infectious diseases lies in maintaining the physical health and combat readiness of armed forces, especially considering the challenging conditions they often operate under. However, as we move towards a more comprehensive understanding of national security, it is becoming increasingly clear that infectious diseases are not just important health issues but also potential threats to national security. This is due to factors such as globalisation, which has facilitated the spread of diseases across borders and regions.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. As Cold War tensions declined, three international issues emerged as new interested in the field of peace studies. The first issue is the potential for a breakdown in détente and the subsequent escalation of Cold War tensions. This was due to the fear that the two superpowers would revert to their previous confrontational stance. The second issue is the emergence of new security threats, which were seen as a result of the decline in Cold War tensions. Finally, there was an increased focus on maintaining peace and negotiating between East and West. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As Cold War tensions subsided, peace studies primarily focused on the potential for a breakdown in détente and the subsequent escalation of Cold War tensions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and facilitating negotiations between East and West.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Peace studies emerged as a response to World War I when the security studies paradigm shifted to include areas of concern such as environmental, societal and economic security.

These goals can include promoting growth, reducing poverty, or increasing security. Incentives play a crucial role in shaping behaviour, as they provide individuals with an incentive to act in a particular way.

The process of securitization is primarily a discursive model, consisting of a speech act where an issue is presented as an existential threat to a referent object, thereby establishing its legitimacy as a security concern. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Edward Said was a postcolonial theorist who argued that the West has constructed the Orient as inferior and irrational in comparison to itself. This idea is based on the notion of Orientalism, which refers to the way in which Western culture has created an image of the East as exotic, mysterious, and primitive.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Edward Said's concept of the 'Orient' is an imagined construct that hinders objective security analysis and should be rejected by scholars in favor of more concrete and factual approaches. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
