D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that Z_26 is a ring with 26 elements, and we are given two elements 20 and -8. To compute their product in the ring, we need to multiply them modulo 26. This means that if the result of the multiplication is greater than or equal to 26, we subtract 26 from it until we get a number between 0 and 25.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Multiplying 20 and -8 gives -160, which corresponds to 11 in Z_26. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because every positive integer rank has a free abelian group of that rank. Statement 2 is false because the Betti number of a finitely generated abelian group can be greater than or equal to its number of elements in some generating set.,B,"Let's reason step by step. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if its Betti number is equal to the number of elements in some generating set, so both statements are true.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. We know that Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field if and only if it has two roots in Z_3, which means that the polynomial can be factored into (x - r1)(x - r2), where r1 and r2 are elements of Z_3. We also know that for any element x in Z_3, we have x^3 + x^2 = 0, so we only need to find two roots that satisfy this equation. One way to do this is by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which states that if a and b are pairwise coprime integers, then there exists an integer solution z such that ax ≡ b mod m for all 1 ≤ i < n. In our case, we have two equations: x^3 + x^2 = 0 and x - r1 = 0 or x - r2 = 0. Solving these equations simultaneously using CRT gives us the roots r1 = 2 and r2 = 1. Therefore, Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field if and only if c = 3."",
    ""Answer"":",-,"Let's reason step by step. Since Z_3 is a field, Z_3[x] is a Euclidean domain, and therefore, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field for any c in Z_3. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 1.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because any set of two vectors in R^2 can be written as a linear combination of the form Ax + By = c where A and B are non-zero matrices, x and y are scalars, and c is a constant. Therefore, any such vector is linearly independent from any other vector that can also be expressed in this way.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since any two non-zero vectors in R^2 are linearly independent, both statements are true. However, the second statement is a consequence of the first one. If V = span(v1, ..., vk) and {v1, ..., vk} are linearly independent, then dim(V) = k.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The order of a factor group is the number of elements in that group. In this case, we are looking for the order of Z_6/<3>, which means we need to find all the possible combinations of 6 numbers modulo 3. These are {0, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 0}, {2, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 2} and so on. The only combination that has exactly one element in common with Z_6 is {0, 1, 2}. Therefore, the order of Z_6/<3> is 3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The factor group Z_6/<3> has order 2, as we are essentially dividing the group Z_6 into two cosets based on the multiples of 3. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because if T is injective, then it maps distinct vectors to distinct images. This means that the kernel of T must be empty, which implies that dim(V) < dim(W). Therefore, statement 2 is also true because if T is injective and bijective, then it maps distinct vectors to distinct images and vice versa. Hence, T must be a one-to-one function.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the dimension of the domain is less than the dimension of the codomain, the linear transformation cannot be injective, and therefore, it cannot be a bijection either. Hence, statement 2 is false.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because every quotient ring of a commutative ring is again a commutative ring. This follows from the definition of a quotient ring and the fact that all rings are commutative.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Since every commutative ring is a ring, and every quotient ring of a ring is again a ring, it follows that every quotient ring of a commutative ring is also commutative. Additionally, for an ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 to be equal to R, it must contain the unity 1. This means that if 1 is not in N, then N cannot be all of R. Therefore, statement 2 is false.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because if a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least one more element of order 15 (since the order of any element divides the order of the group). Therefore, there are at least two elements of order 15 in this case. Statement 2 is also true because if a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, then it must have at least 16 elements of order 15 (since the order of any element divides the order of the group). Therefore, there are at least 17 elements of order 15 in this case.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 due to the existence of inverses and the closure property. Furthermore, if it has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 due to the structure of cyclic subgroups. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is a definition of one-to-one function and statement 2 is a theorem about abelian groups. Since the first statement is true and the second statement is false, we can conclude that both statements are false.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. A permutation is a function that maps each element of one set to another set such that every element in the first set is mapped to exactly one element in the second set. Therefore, if we have two sets and a function that maps elements from the first set to the second set, then this function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one. In other words, no two different elements of the first set are mapped to the same element of the second set.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Every permutation is a one-to-one function by definition. Additionally, every function that is one-to-one is also a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set. Therefore, statement 1 and 2 are both true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because Z_2 is a field and every extension of Z_2 is also a field. Therefore, Q must be an extension field of Z_2.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because if aH is an element of a factor group, then it must be in the form of a/h where h divides a.

According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Therefore, if aH is an element of a factor group, its order must divide the order of a.

Therefore, any two of them can be isomorphic to each other.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic.
