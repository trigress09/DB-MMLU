Therefore, sand cools off faster at night than does vegetation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since sand and vegetation cool off at different rates, their ability to store heat, which is represented by specific heat capacity, must be roughly the same. This means that if one has a higher specific heat capacity than another, it will take more energy to raise its temperature by 1 degree Celsius.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Einstein\u2019s second postulate states that the speed of light is constant in all frames of reference, regardless of their relative motion. This means that if we measure the speed of light from one frame to another, it will always be the same value.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. When an object is set vibrating by a wave that has a matching frequency, the energy of the wave is transferred to the object and causes it to vibrate with greater amplitude. This phenomenon is known as resonance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When the wave's frequency matches the object's natural frequency, the wave bends and focuses its energy onto the object, causing it to vibrate. This phenomenon is known as resonance.",B

This means that as more lamps are added to the circuit, the total resistance increases, which causes the current to decrease. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In a series circuit, the current flows through each lamp consecutively, so the total current drawn from the power source should stay the same regardless of the number of lamps. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A rainbow is the result of light in raindrops that undergoes refraction and dispersion. Refraction occurs when light passes through a medium with a different optical density, causing it to change direction. Dispersion refers to the separation of white light into its component colors as it passes through a prism or other transparent material.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As light enters and exits the raindrops, it bends due to the change in medium, which is the phenomenon of refraction, leading to the separation of colors and the formation of a rainbow. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The speed of sound is affected by the density and elasticity of the medium it travels through. In general, sound travels faster in denser and more elastic media. Therefore, a hot day would have higher temperature and lower air pressure than a cold day, which would make the air less dense and more compressible. This would reduce the speed of sound. A steady temperature day would not have any significant change in density or elasticity of the air, so the speed of sound would be similar to that on a hot day.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sound travels faster in denser mediums, and cold air is denser than hot air, so the speed of sound should be slightly greater on a cold day. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. When red and blue light are overlapped, the color produced is a combination of both colors. The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. Red and blue combine to make magenta, while green and blue combine to make cyan. Yellow can be made by combining all three primary colors. White is not a color but rather the absence of any color.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The horizontal component of the cannonball's velocity is constant, so we can use the formula v = u + at to find its speed after one second.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The cannonball is fired horizontally, so its vertical speed remains negligible, and its overall speed should remain close to the initial 10 m/s. However, due to gravity, it will accelerate downwards at a rate of 9.8 m/s^2 for one second. Therefore, its final velocity after one second would be 10 + (9.8 * 1) = 19.8 m/s. The closest answer is 20 m/s.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In a series circuit, the current in each component is the same and equal to the total current of the circuit. Therefore, if one lamp has a current of 2 A, then the other lamp must also have a current of 2 A.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In a series circuit, the current is divided among the components, so if one lamp has a current of 2 A, the next lamp should have half that amount, which is 1 A. Therefore, the answer is B.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. The apparent slowing down of clocks on a fast-moving spaceship is due to the effects of time dilation, which occurs when an object moves at high speeds relative to another observer. This means that the clock on the spaceship appears to run slower than the clock on Earth, as observed from the latter.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the principle of relativity, time dilation is a reciprocal effect, so if clocks on the spaceship appear slow from Earth, then clocks on Earth should also appear slow from the spaceship. In this case, the most appropriate answer is both of these.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a model airplane flies into the wind, it has to work harder to overcome the resistance of the air and thus its groundspeed is slower than if there was no wind. Conversely, when flying with the wind at its back, the airplane can use the wind as an additional source of thrust and thus its groundspeed is faster than in still air. Therefore, the correct answer is either greater or less depending on wind speed.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When flying at right angles to the wind, the crosswind counteracts the effects of headwind or tailwind, resulting in a groundspeed that's the same as flying in still air. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The normal force is the component of the gravitational force that acts perpendicular to the surface on which an object rests. In this case, since the ball is rolling in a circular path, it experiences a centripetal acceleration towards the center of the circle.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The net force on the ball is equal to its mass times acceleration, which in this case is due to gravity and is negative since it acts downward. At the 10-m position, the ball has reached half of its maximum height, so its velocity is zero. Therefore, the net force at that point must be equal to the weight of the ball, which is mg. Since the net force on the ball is constant throughout its motion, we can use this value to find the acceleration due to gravity, which is g = F/m = mg/m = -g. The magnitude of the net force is then 2mg, so the answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the net force on the ball is mg at the maximum height of 20m, and 10m is half of that height, it makes sense that the net force on the ball at 10m is mg/4.
