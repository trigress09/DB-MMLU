    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The given conditions can be expressed using the Boolean formula (p_1 \u2227 p_2 \u2228 p_3 \u2227 p_4). This formula is true if and only if at least three of the variables are true. Therefore, the answer is I."",
    ""Answer"": ""I""",-,"Let's reason step by step. Checking for an even number of true variables involves counting and comparing, which can be expressed using combinations of AND and OR operations. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,Let's reason step by step. A doubly linked list is a good data structure for implementing mergesort because it allows for efficient merging of the two halves. This makes it suitable for problems where the data needs to be sorted in a way that preserves the relative order of elements within each half.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Merging two sorted lists efficiently requires random access to elements, which is only possible with arrays, not linked lists. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given recursive definition suggests a pattern of exponential growth. Each term in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor. Therefore, the order of growth is T(n) = 3^n. The correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The recursive calls within the function definition suggest a logarithmic factor, leading to an overall order of growth of O(n^2 log n). Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aggressive pipelining aims to minimize the number of pipeline stages while maintaining data integrity. Instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute pose a significant obstacle as it can lead to increased pipeline overhead and performance degradation. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Variable-length instructions require additional processing to determine their boundaries and align them properly, hindering efficient pipelining. This can be an obstacle to aggressive pipelining, where instructions are executed in parallel with minimal latency between them. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
B,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The provided program employs a hash table to store word presence information. When a word is encountered in the document, the corresponding entry in the hash table is updated. Checking spelling involves examining the appropriate entry in the hash table based on the word's presence. Therefore, both statement I and statement II are correct."",
    ""Answer"": ""I and II only""",-,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking. Therefore, the answer is both I and II."",
    ""Answer"": ""II""",-
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given scenario involves real-time data acquisition and processing, requiring fast digitization and averaging of analog signals. Based on the provided information, the maximum time for one input to be digitized should be minimized. Therefore, option C with a time of 1.6 microseconds emerges as the optimal choice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. Option C provides a sufficient margin of 1.6 microseconds, ensuring timely conversion and output of the average values.",C
