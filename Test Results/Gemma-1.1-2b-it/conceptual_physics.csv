The atmosphere does not contain significant amounts of carbon-14, making choice A incorrect. Food and nuclear bomb tests do not produce significant amounts of carbon-14.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbon-14 is a type of carbon that is found in living organisms. We obtain carbon primarily through the food we eat, so it makes sense that Carbon-14 is produced in the food we eat. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The electric field inside a Van de Graaff generator is indeed zero when the dome is uncharged. This is because the positively charged particles in the dome are balanced by the negatively charged particles in the collector plate, creating no net electric field.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A Van de Graaff generator accumulates charge on its dome, creating an electric field. Therefore, the electric field inside the dome should be non-zero when the dome is charged. The correct answer is therefore B.",B
