A,"Let's reason step by step. The greenhouse effect is primarily driven by gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in Earth's atmosphere. Mars, however, has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. While carbon dioxide does contribute to heat retention, its effect is significantly outweighed by the lack of other greenhouse gases. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The greenhouse effect requires a planet to have sufficient internal heat to drive the trapping of infrared radiation, which Mars lacks. Consequently, the atmosphere on Mars is unable to efficiently trap heat and maintain a warm surface temperature.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The nebular theory successfully predicts the overall structure of our solar system, including the formation of planets and moons around the Sun.

Therefore, the most likely explanation is that Mars once had warm, wet conditions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inner planets are indeed made of denser materials than the outer planets due to the initial conditions within the protoplanetary disk.
