Therefore, the answer is C.",C,Let's reason step by step. CART is a clustering algorithm that builds a decision tree by recursively partitioning the data based on the values of the features. This allows the algorithm to capture complex relationships between the features and the target variable.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because back-propagation algorithms aim to find the optimal weights that minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual target values. Statement 2 is also true as the VC dimension of a line represents its complexity and the ability to distinguish between different data points. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since we can find at least one case of 3 points that cannot be shattered by any line, then the VC dimension of a line should be at most 2. This statement is true.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Supervised learning algorithms are those where the model learns from labeled data, meaning that each input has a corresponding output. In contrast, unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data and rely on patterns and structures within the data itself to make predictions. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Naive Bayesian is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points based on their similarity. It does not require labeled training examples like supervised learning methods. Therefore, the answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The number of independent parameters in a Bayesian network represents the number of different combinations of variables that are potentially dependent on each other. In this case, the graph shows dependencies between variables H, U, P, and W. Therefore, we would need 4 independent parameters to model these dependencies without making any assumptions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are 4 nodes in the graph, then we would need 4 independent parameters to describe the joint probability distribution. However, since we make no assumptions about independence or conditional independence, this number remains unchanged at 4.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because support vector machines leverage the underlying probability distribution of the data to provide a probabilistic interpretation of the model's predictions. Statement 2 is false as the shape and distribution of the support vectors can change depending on the kernel used. Higher-order polynomial kernels generally result in more complex and flexible decision boundaries, but they also introduce additional parameters that need to be tuned.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Support vector machines always give a probability distribution over the possible labels, just like logistic regression models. Additionally, the support vectors remain relevant across different kernel types because they capture the underlying patterns in the data. Therefore, the answer is A and B.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true because the training error of a classifier measures its prediction accuracy on a given dataset. A low training error indicates good predictive performance. Statement 2 is also true as the MAP estimate converges to the MLE estimate under certain conditions, such as infinite data. Therefore, both statements are correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. 1-nearest neighbor classifier will always correctly classify all training points, leading to a training error of 0. On the other hand, MAP estimate is generally consistent with MLE when the number of data points grows to infinity. Therefore, statement 2 is true.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The observed behavior suggests a potential issue with overfitting. As the amount of training data increases, the model has more parameters to learn from, leading to lower training error but also potentially higher test error due to increased variance in the data. Therefore, the most probable answer is high estimation bias.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The increasing training error and decreasing test error indicate that the model is unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data, suggesting high bias. High bias occurs when the model learns random fluctuations in the data rather than the actual relationships between features and target variables. Therefore, the most probable answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Density-based clustering is well-suited for grouping data points based on their spatial proximity.

Full class covariance matrices provide more flexibility at the cost of increased computational complexity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If we force all classes to share the same mean vector, the model's complexity is greatly reduced, leading to a higher risk of underfitting. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The MAP estimate penalizes models that deviate from the prior distribution more severely than the MLE. Therefore, the variance of the MAP estimate will generally be lower than the variance of the MLE when the prior distribution is informative. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The MAP estimate incorporates prior information, which adds an additional source of variability, leading to a higher variance compared to the MLE. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Adding $\\ell_2$ regularization encourages the model to learn weights with smaller magnitudes, promoting sparsity and reducing overfitting. Consequently, both bias and variance of the model will decrease as the regularization coefficient increases.",B,"Let's reason step by step.
