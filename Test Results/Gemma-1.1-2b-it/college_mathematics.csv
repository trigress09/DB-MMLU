    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The given conditions imply that A is contained within B, which in turn is contained within C. Therefore, B must also be contained within C. Thus, the answer is both I and III."",
    ""Answer"": ""I and III""",-,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. If A and C are connected, then any disconnection of B would also disconnect either A or C, which contradicts their connectedness. Therefore, B must be connected. This proves statement I."",

B,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 defines a circular region within the unit square. The probability that a point (x, y) is chosen from this region is proportional to the area of the region. In this case, the area where 2(x + y) > 1 is the upper right quadrant of the unit square. Therefore, the probability is 1/4.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The inequality 0 < |x| + |y| < 1 represents a square region in the plane. The line 2(x + y) = 1 divides this square diagonally into two equal halves, so the probability that 2(x + y) > 1 must be 1/sqrt(2). Therefore, the answer is D.",D

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The number of different complete assignments is calculated using the formula for combinations, which involves selecting k items from a set without regard to order. In this case, we need to choose 2 professors to teach each of the 20 courses, so the total number of possible assignments is given by:",-,"Let's reason step by step. There are 10 choices for the professor to teach the first course, 9 choices for the second course, and so on. Therefore, the total number of assignments is 10^20, but we need to subtract the cases where two professors are assigned the same pair of courses, which is 2^10. Therefore, the final answer is 10^(20) - 2^10.",C

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Subspace U consists of matrices that commute with T, while subspace W contains matrices that anticommute with T. Therefore, dim(U) ≤ dim(V). Additionally, since V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, the other subspace W must also be spanned by eigenvectors of T. Thus, the answer is III."",
    ""Answer"": ""III""",-,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. If V has a basis containing only eigenvectors of T, then T is diagonalizable, which means that every matrix X in M(V) commutes with T. Therefore, U must be equal to M(V). This proves statement I."",

B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 indicates that the closure of a function must exist if it is connected. Statement 2 implies that every continuous function has at least one fixed point. Therefore, the answer should be True, True.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since A is connected, any separation of its closure would also separate A itself, which contradicts its connectedness. Therefore, the closure of A must also be connected. Statement 2 implies the existence of a fixed point within the function's domain, which aligns with the closure's definition.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A right ideal of a ring must contain the identity element of that ring. Therefore, if R has exactly two right ideals, it means that R is either commutative or a division ring.",B,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. If R has exactly two right ideals, then it must be a field, which means that it is commutative and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. Moreover, fields are always infinite. Therefore, the only valid option is D."",

D,"Let's reason step by step. The factorial of a positive integer is calculated by multiplying all positive integers less than or equal to that integer. Therefore, the number of positive integers k for which the ordinary decimal representation of k! ends in exactly 99 zeros is equivalent to the number of factors of k ending in 0. This translates into (k-1) such integers. Thus, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of factors of 10, which is the same as the number of factors of 2. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in any factorial, there cannot be any factorial ending in exactly 99 zeros. Therefore, the answer is zero.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of getting a six on a single toss is 1/6. Therefore, the probability of getting 70 or more successes in 360 tosses is approximately 0.54. This suggests that the probability of obtaining 70 or more sixes in 360 tosses is between 0.16 and 0.50.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The expected number of sixes in 360 tosses is 60, and the standard deviation is about 7.75. Therefore, the probability of getting 70 or more sixes should be greater than 0.50, since it is more than one standard deviation away from the mean. The most appropriate answer is therefore A.",A
