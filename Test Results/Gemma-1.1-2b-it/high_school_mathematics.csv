B,"Let's reason step by step. Let x be the number. Then, 85 = x^2 - 17x. Rearranging this equation gives x^2 - 17x - 85 = 0. This factors as (x - 15)(x + 5) = 0. Therefore, x = 15 or x = -5. However, since the number must be positive, the answer is x = 15.",A,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The problem states that 85 more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. So, we need to find a number whose square is 85-17=68. Therefore, the number must be 8. Answer: B""",-
D,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2)base * height. In this case, we have a base length of 10 and a height length of 12, so the area is (1/2)10 * 12 = 60\\sqrt{7}. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the product of its altitudes. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 10 * 12 * 15 = 1800. The answer should be C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The product of two real numbers is positive if and only if both factors are positive or both factors are negative. In this case, we need to check the signs of $a$ and $b$. Since $-3\\leq a\\leq1$, it follows that $a$ must be positive. Similarly, since $-2\\leq b\\leq 4$, it follows that $b$ must also be positive. Therefore, the product $a\\cdot b$ is positive in this case.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The product $a \cdot b$ is positive when both $a$ and $b$ are positive or when both are negative. The range of possible values for $a$ is 4 and for $b$ is 6, so there are 4*6=24 possible combinations. Therefore, the probability that the product is positive is 24/60 = 1/5.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The circumference of a circle is $2\pi r$, where r is the radius. Therefore, the radius is $r = 12/2\pi = 2$. The area of a square with sides equal to the length of the radius is $A = s^2 = 2^2 = 4$. The answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that the circle has a circumference of $12\pi$ units. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by $\pi r^2$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{12}$. Therefore, the area of the square is equal to the square of the side length, which is 12 square units.",C
