D,"Let's reason step by step. The significance level represents the maximum tolerated probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In this case, with a significance level of 0.05, there is a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true).

The confidence interval tells us the range of values where the true difference in life expectancies lies with a 90% probability. Comparing this to the given information suggests that the mean life expectancy of one model is likely higher than the other, but not necessarily twice as high.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval for the slope indicates that there is a range of plausible values for the true slope. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty whether there is a non-zero correlation or not. However, the interval containing 0 suggests the possibility of a linear relationship.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval for the slope doesn't include zero, which means the slope is likely positive. This suggests that there's a linear relationship between the variables, but the correlation might be close to zero. Therefore, answer choices B and C are correct.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a Type II error (false negative) is the complement of the significance level, which is 1 - \u03b1 = 0.9. Therefore, when conducting a hypothesis test at the 10% significance level, there is a 10% chance of making a Type II error.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

In this case, the most likely explanation is that the sample was not chosen randomly, potentially leading to biased results.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sampling error happens when interviewers use their own judgment to choose participants instead of using random selection. This can introduce bias and make the sample less representative of the population. Therefore, the answer is C.",C

We want the cup to overflow less than 1% of the time, which means 99% of the time it should be filled correctly. The z-score for 99% is 0.99, so the mean setting should be 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The business manager's decision to use a 2-sample t-test is questionable due to the small sample size in each office. A small sample size can lead to unreliable results, making the t-test sensitive to outliers and non-normality. Therefore, using a t-test in this case would not be appropriate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 2-sample t-test is specifically designed for comparing the means of two small groups, making it suitable for this situation with limited engineers in each office. While the sample size might be small, the nature of the data allows for valid statistical analysis under certain conditions. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given probabilities suggest a situation where the occurrence of event E is dependent on the occurrence of event F, implying they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the probability of E and F occurring together is not zero, it means they are not mutually exclusive. And because they have a non-zero intersection, they must also be independent. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The airport authority implemented a 5% rent increase, implying a fixed amount was added to the kiosk's price. Therefore, the mean price will remain the same, but the range of prices will increase by 50 cents due to the increased costs associated with the rent hike.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If all prices increase by the same amount, the mean price will also increase by that amount, and the range will remain unchanged. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The key to judging whether this is a simple random sample lies in examining the selection process. In stratified sampling, individuals or groups are systematically sampled based on predetermined criteria. In this case, the employees are not selected at random from each assembly plant. Instead, they are randomly selected from the entire workforce. Therefore, this scenario does not represent simple random sampling and is therefore incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since each plant contributes the same number of employees to the sample, it ensures that every employee has an equal chance of being selected, making it a simple random sample. Therefore, answer choice C is the correct response.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. T-distribution is a probability distribution used to estimate the mean of a population when sample size is small. It is not bell-shaped or symmetric, and its mean and standard deviation can be different from 0 and 1 depending on the specific scenario. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Just like the standard normal distribution, all t-distributions have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, regardless of the degrees of freedom. Therefore, answer choice C is incorrect.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation measures the spread of the salaries around the mean. In this case, we are primarily interested in the variability within the lower half of the distribution. Therefore, the appropriate answer is approximately $10,476.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The first quartile corresponds to a z-score of approximately -0.67. So, the standard deviation is simply the mean multiplied by this z-score, which gives us around $10,476. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling aims to ensure that different subgroups of the population are represented in the sample in a way that reflects their prevalence in the broader population. Asking questions in a neutral manner avoids introducing bias into the survey by minimizing the influence of personal biases or preconceived notions on the responses. Therefore, option B is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Randomly selecting samples, regardless of the specific method used, is the most crucial step in reducing bias and ensuring a representative sample. Following up with non-respondents or asking neutral questions might introduce recall bias or selective response bias, respectively. Using stratified random sampling can also introduce bias if the population is not evenly distributed across different subgroups.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. To estimate the sample size needed for a confidence interval with a margin of error of 2.5%, we can use the formula: n = (Z^2 * p(1-p)) / e^2, where Z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, p is the estimated proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate. In this case, with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 2.5%, the minimum sample size would be approximately 1537. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the formula for sample size with a 95% confidence level and 2.5% margin of error, we get a minimum sample size of approximately 40 voters. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The high percentage of respondents supporting capital punishment suggests a strong sentiment against such measures. This could be due to various factors, including concerns about the justice system's effectiveness, ethical implications, or societal values surrounding punishment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the sample size is large, the survey suffers from voluntary response bias. Selecting a random sample from the respondents would address this issue and provide a more representative view. Additionally, the lack of information regarding the characteristics of the listeners makes it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 25th percentile corresponds to the middle 25% of the data. Therefore, we need to find the value that separates the lower 25% from the upper 75%. This can be calculated using the formula Q3 = xÌ + z*SD, where xÌ is the sample mean and z is the z-score corresponding to the desired percentile. Applying this formula with xÌ = 45 and z = 0.674 gives us a mass of approximately 42.4 g. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 25th percentile is one standard deviation below the mean. So, subtracting the standard deviation of 4 g from the mean of 45 g gives us 42.2 g as the egg mass at the 25th percentile. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A cluster sampling procedure involves dividing the population into smaller groups called clusters and then selecting a representative sample from each cluster. This approach is suitable when the population is divided into well-defined, homogeneous subgroups with little variation between them. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since a random sample of principals is obtained from each district, it essentially forms a simple random sample of the entire population, just achieved in a more manageable way. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The closeness of the means suggests that the two distributions are similar in shape, albeit with different scales. Therefore, the student's score on the final exam should be within a few standard deviations of the mean. Using the empirical rule, her score must have been around 118 points.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the student has the same standardized score on both exams, it means her raw score on the final exam should also be 58 points, maintaining the same relative position within each distribution. Therefore, the answer must be 58.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the union of two events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring individually. If A and B are mutually exclusive, the union becomes the sum of P(A) and P(B). If A and B are independent, the union becomes the product of P(A) and P(B). In this case, the answer depends on the specific context of the problem.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For mutually exclusive events, the probability of the union is simply the sum of their individual probabilities. So, P(A âª B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5, regardless of independence or subset relationships. Therefore, answer choices A, B and C are all equal to 0.5.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The combined mean of the smartwatch and its packaging is approximately 518 grams, which falls within the range of the observed values. Additionally, the standard deviation of the combined distribution is approximately 7 grams, which is close to the estimated standard deviation of the smartwatch itself (6 grams). Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the weight of the smartwatch and its packaging is relatively uniform.",C,"Let's reason step by step. When combining independent variables, we subtract their means and standard deviations. So, the combined distribution would have a mean of 394 grams (62 - 456) and a standard deviation of 6.1 grams (1.0 - 6). Therefore, the answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the distribution is normal, we can use the empirical rule to determine the 10th percentile. The 10th percentile corresponds to a z-score of -1.28. Using a standard normal table, we find that the corresponding amount of rainfall is approximately 3.95 inches.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 10th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.28. Adding this z-score to the mean rainfall of 6 inches gives us the highest amount of rainfall for the driest 10% of months, which is 8.05 inches. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize the power of the test, we need to choose a significance level that is sufficiently small and a sample size that is large enough to detect a significant difference from the null hypothesis. In this case, option C seems like the best choice as it provides both a low significance level (0.05) and a relatively large sample size (30). Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A lower significance level (Î±) reduces the chance of a Type I error, which is more important for ensuring the accuracy of the test, leading to greater power even with a smaller sample size. Therefore, choice B with \u03b1 = 0.01 and n = 15 offers the highest power.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation measures how much the scores deviate from the mean. A lower standard deviation indicates greater homogeneity, while a higher standard deviation indicates more heterogeneity. In this case, Mr. Bee's class with a lower standard deviation suggests less variability in their test performance, implying a more homogeneous group. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Bee's class performed better than Mr. Em's.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in scores. So, Mr. Bee's class with a larger standard deviation must have performed twice as well as Mr. Em's class. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Bee's class performed better.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval encompasses values below zero, which indicates that we cannot conclude with absolute certainty whether the proportion of women or men interested in shopping on Sundays differs. Therefore, we cannot draw any definitive conclusions from this data.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval contains only negative values, which suggests an error in the calculation or data. Therefore, the interval is invalid and cannot be interpreted. The correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient (r) represents the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. In this case, an r value of 0.78 indicates a strong positive correlation, suggesting that the independent variable (x) is strongly associated with the dependent variable (y). Therefore, the linear regression model explains approximately 44% of the variation in y.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient squared (r^2) represents the proportion of variance shared between the two variables. So, we simply need to divide 0.78^2 by 2 to get the percentage. Therefore, the linear regression model explains approximately 44% of the variation in y.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the sum of X and Y is equal to the sum of their individual expected values: E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y). Therefore, the expected value of X + Y is 99.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the sum is simply the sum of the expected values, so E(X+Y) = 37 + 62 = 99. Similarly, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances, so var(X+Y) = 5 + 12 = 17. Therefore, the expected value and variance of the random variable X + Y are 99 and 17 respectively.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies involve collecting data on a population without manipulating any variables. This allows researchers to observe correlations between different factors and identify potential associations. However, they typically do not involve intentionally forcing treatments or subjects into specific groups. In contrast, controlled experiments manipulate variables to determine cause and effect relationships. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies involve actively introducing a treatment to a group and observing the effects, while still examining a pre-existing condition. This allows researchers to assess the association between the intervention and the outcome without manipulating individual factors. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A representative sample should aim to capture the diversity of the population. In this case, classifying customers by state would provide a geographically diverse group of participants, allowing the company to understand how musical preferences vary across different regions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since musical tastes vary by region, we need equal representation from each state. Choosing 10 customers from each state ensures we capture the diversity of preferences across different geographical locations. Option C is the correct answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To perform a t-test, we need to assume that the population standard deviations at both locations are equal. If this assumption is not met, then the results of the t-test may be unreliable.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The t-test requires knowledge of the population standard deviations to accurately estimate the standard error and calculate the test statistic. Therefore, this assumption is necessary for the validity of the t-test.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. This scenario involves an observation of a group's performance in relation to a specific intervention. The teacher claims that the practice quiz leads to improved understanding. However, without a control group or a clear mechanism for assigning participants to the quiz condition, it is challenging to establish causality between the quiz and the observed outcome.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the teacher didn't randomly assign students to different groups, this study lacks the necessary randomization for it to be considered a true experiment. Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions about whether the practice quiz had any causal impact on student performance.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The newspaper poll likely captured the opinions of a specific group of people who were more likely to participate in the survey, potentially reflecting their own biases or perceptions rather than the overall sentiment of the population. This could lead to a significant difference between the percentages obtained from the poll and the actual vote outcome.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the poll and the vote suggests a selection bias, where the individuals who responded to the survey were not representative of the entire population of voters. This could be due to factors such as age, income, or political affiliation. Therefore, option C is the best answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The provided information suggests a conditional probability scenario. We need to consider the probability of an accident occurring under the specific weather condition (wet or dry). In this case, the provided probabilities suggest that the chance of an accident is higher when the weather is wet (1.0%) compared to dry (0.2%). Therefore, the probability of an accident on Highway 48 today is likely higher than 0.0036.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The probability of an accident is simply the probability of wet weather multiplied by the probability of an accident on a wet day, which is 0.2 * 0.01 = 0.002, or 0.2%. Therefore, the probability that there will be an accident on Highway 48 today is 0.002.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given information suggests a potential outlier effect. An outlier is a data point that significantly deviates from the overall pattern and affects the calculated statistics like slope and correlation. In this case, the removal of the point (15,2) leads to a significant decrease in both the slope and correlation coefficient, indicating an influential effect on the data.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The removal of the point caused a drastic shift in the slope and correlation, suggesting a discontinuity in the data at that point. This indicates the presence of an influential observation that significantly affects the statistical calculations.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. This scenario involves estimating the number of contacts needed to achieve a certain probability. Option C assigns equal probabilities for success and failure, which is unrealistic in this context. Option D assigns progressively higher probabilities for successful and unsuccessful outcomes, which aligns better with the scenario where the agent needs to determine the minimum number of contacts. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate choice.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the agent is successful 20% of the time, we should assign more numbers to represent success. Assigning 0 to 4 for success and 5 to 9 for failure reflects this proportion. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"{

A,"Let's reason step by step. A stratified sample would be appropriate in this situation as it allows for the inclusion of employees from different countries, ensuring representation of their respective proportions within each office. This enables estimation of the overall proportion of employees favoring smoking cessation across all offices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the employees are naturally grouped by country, we should use cluster sampling. We can randomly select a few countries and survey all employees within those selected clusters. This ensures representation from each country while minimizing bias towards any specific office or group.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The empirical rule suggests that approximately 68% of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean. Therefore, the mean weight should be around 15,000 pounds. Moreover, since 80% of weights exceed 10,000 pounds, the standard deviation must also be around 1,000 pounds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.52. Similarly, 80% weighing more than 10,000 pounds corresponds to a z-score of 0.84. Therefore, the mean is 14,900 and the standard deviation is 6,100. The answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The difference in study time between the two exams suggests a potential relationship between the amount of time studied and exam performance. A higher number of hours of studying might indicate improved knowledge retention or better understanding of the material. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a positive correlation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every student studied more for the second exam compared to the first, there's a perfect positive correlation between the study hours for each exam. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Variance measures the spread of data around the mean, and it remains unchanged regardless of whether outliers are present. Therefore, Charlotte should calculate and report the variance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The variance is calculated using squared deviations from the mean, which makes it less sensitive to individual changes in data points. Therefore, the variance will remain unchanged. However, adding two inches to the recorded height of the tallest student will alter the standard deviation and mean absolute deviation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Independence implies that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other. Therefore, statement A is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If A and B are independent, it means they cannot occur at the same time, so they must be mutually exclusive. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sampling distribution of a sample mean approximates the normal distribution under several conditions: (i) the population has a normal distribution, (ii) the sample size is sufficiently large (n â¥ 30), and (iii) there are no significant outliers in the data. Therefore, answer C is correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will always approach a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution. Therefore, this statement is true under any condition.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. This experiment suffers from a common flaw known as selection bias. Students volunteered for the study, creating a biased sample where those who enjoy reading more are more likely to participate. This introduces the possibility that intrinsic characteristics of participants, such as motivation or prior reading habits, may confound the results. Therefore, this design cannot establish a causal relationship between reading time and GPA.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The experiment uses randomization to assign students to different reading groups, which allows for a cause-and-effect conclusion about the impact of reading time on GPA. While correlational studies can show an association between reading and GPA, it cannot establish causation due to potential confounding factors like student motivation or baseline differences.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. A census is primarily used to estimate the size or composition of a population. However, it would be unreasonable to use a census for purposes that require precise estimates of individual characteristics within a population. In scenarios like this, alternative methods such as surveys or observational data might be more appropriate.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A census is the most accurate method for determining proportions, as it involves collecting data from every individual in the population. Therefore, it's reasonable to use a census to determine the proportion of red snappers with high mercury levels. In contrast, determining the difference between two proportions requires comparing samples, which is not feasible with a census.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The mean waiting time for a roller coaster is 35 minutes, and the standard deviation is 10 minutes. Therefore, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders is likely within the range of 31.7 to 39.3 minutes. This suggests that the answer lies between B and C.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Plan I relies on randomly sampling 30 students from the entire student body, which provides a broader representation of the population but may not be representative of the stock market investment behavior of all students. On the other hand, Plan II focuses on students with investments in the market, which could lead to a more accurate estimate if a significant portion of the student population has substantial investments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plan I is better because it considers the entire student population, providing a more accurate representation of the overall investment distribution. By contrast, Plan II relies on a smaller sample of students with potentially biased investments, leading to an inaccurate estimate.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided t-statistic (-1.973) falls within the range of values associated with a t-distribution with 17 degrees of freedom at a 5% significance level. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no convincing evidence to suggest that the mean mass of eggs from these hens differs from 56 grams.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the test statistic t is negative, it falls outside the range of Â±1.96, which is the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of success in the first game is 55%, while in the second game it's 80%. Therefore, flipping the coin 300 times would provide a significantly higher chance of winning compared to 30 times.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A larger sample size always provides a more accurate estimate of the true proportion of heads, increasing the chances of winning in both games. Therefore, flipping the coin 300 times is preferable for both scenarios. The answer is C.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of rolling a 6 on one dice is 1/6, and the probability of rolling a 6 on the other dice is also 1/6. Therefore, the probability of both dice showing a 6 simultaneously is (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/36. The expected gain per game is therefore -$2 + (1/36) x $20 = about -$0.55. Therefore, the player will lose about $0.55 on average per game.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of rolling two sixes is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of committing a Type I error is the significance level, which in this case is 0.05. To control this risk, we need to conduct multiple tests and reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore, the probability of making a Type I error with at least one test failing to reject the null hypothesis is 1 - 0.05 = 0.40.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of committing a Type I error in a single test is 0.05. Therefore, the probability of making at least one Type I error in 10 tests is also 0.05.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Both wordings could potentially influence respondents' answers. The first wording, with its higher percentage, might create a perception of greater support for the budget increase. On the other hand, the second wording, with its lower percentage, might create a perception of lower support due to a placebo effect. Therefore, the answer lies in the wording that elicits stronger responses.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy in results is likely due to a placebo effect, where the wording of the questions influenced participants' responses, creating a perceived benefit from the proposed budget increase. This suggests that the effectiveness of the question design itself, rather than any inherent characteristics of the topic, might be influencing the participants' perceptions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. While both sample sizes provide estimates of the population mean, the sample size significantly impacts the width of the confidence interval. A larger sample size leads to a narrower confidence interval, indicating greater precision in estimating the population mean. Therefore, using 35 observations provides a more accurate estimate with a narrower margin of error compared to the 15 observations case.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 introduces more variability and potential for error, making the results less reliable. Therefore, using 15 observations might be preferable in this case.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, an appropriate analysis type is independent samples comparison of population means.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the study compares the proportion of engines with extended lifespans when using the additive versus not using it, a matched pairs comparison of population proportions is most appropriate. This analysis allows for direct comparison of the two groups while controlling for potential confounding factors.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To calculate the midpoint for a 95% confidence interval, we can use the formula: sample proportion +/- margin of error. In this case, the sample proportion is 8%, and the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the midpoint for the confidence interval is 8% +/- 2.5%, which gives us a range of 5.5% to 10.5%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the midpoint of the interval is 0.08 + 0.025 = 0.105.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample involves selecting each member of the population with an equal probability of selection. In this case, the school serves as the population, and every student has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. Therefore, this scenario represents a simple random sample.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As long as there is a single entrance to the school, selecting every 25th student ensures that each student has an equal chance of being selected, resulting in a simple random sample. Therefore, answer choice C is the correct response.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sample size directly affects the confidence interval width. A larger sample size leads to a wider interval due to increased variability in the data. Therefore, the confidence interval size is indirectly proportional to the sample size.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tripling the sample size reduces the standard error by a factor of square root of 3, which is approximately 1.732. Therefore, the confidence interval size is multiplied by 1.732. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of a random variable represents the average value we would obtain if we repeatedly sampled the variable many times. In this case, the expected value of W is 992 pounds, which aligns with our prior knowledge that players in the NFL typically weigh around 248 pounds. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. So, the standard deviation of W is sqrt(4 * 47^2) = 94 pounds. Therefore, the expected value of W is approximately 992 pounds.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile corresponds to the middle point of the distribution. Therefore, a bag weighing at the 40th percentile is exactly equal to the mean weight. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.25. Therefore, the weight of a bag at the 40th percentile is 0.25 * 0.28 = 0.07 ounces above the mean. The answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Both niacin and Lipitor are known to have lipid-lowering effects. While both medications demonstrated a significant reduction in mean cholesterol levels, the magnitude of the difference between the two treatments varied. Therefore, while we cannot definitively state that one medication is definitively superior to the other, there is a reasonable possibility that Lipitor will be more effective in lowering cholesterol for any individual taking it.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies a 95% probability that any individual's cholesterol reduction with Lipitor will fall within the given range compared to niacin. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that there is a significant difference between the two treatments in lowering cholesterol levels.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given z-score of -2.46 indicates a significant deviation from the expected value of 9500 pounds. This suggests that the production process might have introduced changes that impacted engine thrust. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is B: 99.31% of the engines produced under the new process will have a thrust under 9500 pounds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.0069 means there's a 0.69% chance that an engine produced with the new process will have a thrust greater than the original mean of 9500 pounds. Therefore, the most reasonable conclusion is that the production process change might have indeed lowered the thrust of some engines.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting minutes to seconds will change the scale of the scores, but the relative rankings of students should remain unchanged. Therefore, the student's standardized score will retain its value of z = 2.40.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Converting seconds to minutes involves dividing by 60, so the z-score should also be divided by 60, resulting in a new z-score of 0.04. Therefore, the student's standardized score will remain unchanged when converted from seconds to minutes.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias can arise from various sources, including sampling bias (sampling errors) or measurement error. Sampling bias occurs when the sample is not representative of the population. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C, indicating a lack of randomization in the sampling process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to a sampling process that systematically excludes or overrepresents certain segments of the population, leading to a sample that doesn't reflect the population's characteristics. This can happen due to various reasons such as unequal access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, or geographic location. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The goal of this study is to compare the effect of different musical genres on piecework output. A control group is crucial to understand the natural performance of the workers without any external influence. In this case, a group that listens to no music would provide a baseline for comparison. Therefore, option B would be the best choice for serving as the control group in this study.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A good control group should experience elements of both treatments to isolate the effects of each music genre, so a group randomly exposed to classical or rock music would be ideal. This allows for the comparison of piecework output between the experimental and control groups while controlling for potential confounding factors.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling aims to achieve representativeness within specific strata of the population. This allows for estimation of parameters that are relevant to each stratum while controlling for potential confounding factors. While this approach provides valuable insights into population characteristics, it may not be suitable when the population is highly heterogeneous or when access to certain strata is limited.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling ensures representation from all strata, providing information about each subgroup and the overall population, which simple random sampling doesn't necessarily achieve. Additionally, stratified random sampling can be more efficient in terms of sample size, especially when the population is complex or heavily stratified.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. An experiment aims to manipulate variables systematically to test their causal relationship with specific outcomes. In contrast, an observational study observes phenomena naturally occurring in a population without manipulating any variables. Therefore, the primary difference lies in the intention behind the research approach.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The main difference lies in the use of control and treatment groups; while both methods utilize these groups, experiments require randomization to ensure unbiased results, whereas observational studies don't. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population mean. Since the entire range falls within the interval, we can conclude with high confidence that the mean weight of oranges of this variety lies within this range as well.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of oranges from this variety will fall within the weight range of 7.58 to 8.72 ounces. Therefore, the statement is true that in repeated samples of the same size, 95% of the intervals constructed will contain the true mean weight.",C

Therefore, it measures the evidence against the null hypothesis and helps assess the significance of the observed results.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value represents the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false, indicating the likelihood of a Type II error. Therefore, the best description of a P-value is the probability of making a Type II error.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Option III presents a scenario with a high probability of losing money. Therefore, it should be avoided regardless of the expected return. Option I guarantees a fixed profit, making it a safe choice if risk aversion is not a major concern. Option II offers the potential for higher returns but also carries significant uncertainty. Therefore, option II should be chosen to maximize expected return.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize expected return, the company should choose Option II, as it has the highest average potential return of $30,000 compared to the other options. However, it also carries a 50% chance of losing $10,000.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided scenario showcases the placebo effect, where the brain's perception of a treatment influences its actual effects. In this case, the consistent increase in production across different music conditions suggests that the participants were responding to the perceived change in their environment rather than the actual musical content.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Each change in music genre acts as a separate treatment unit, and the observed increase in production is a direct result of the specific music played each day. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: the placebo effect.",B

According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Since 70% of parts last less than 6 years, the standard deviation should be around (6-3)/3 = 1 year. Therefore, the mean lifespan is approximately 4 years.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The claim suggests that the proportion of visitors shopping at the department store is greater than 0.60. Therefore, we should use a hypothesis testing approach where we test whether p (the population proportion of visitors shopping there) is greater than 0.60. This leads to hypothesis: H0: p = 0.60 and Ha: p > 0.60.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To support the claim that over 60% of visitors shop at the store, the null hypothesis should state that the proportion is less than or equal to 60%, while the alternative hypothesis claims it's greater than 60%.

Therefore, answer B is the correct choice.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A wider confidence interval indicates a lower degree of certainty in estimating the population parameter. This could be due to various factors, such as sample size limitations or variability within the population. Therefore, the interval expanding from 90% to 99% suggests a decrease in the precision of the estimate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% requires a wider interval to capture a larger range of possible values, resulting in a 9% increase in interval size.

Therefore, Company I's fuse has a significantly lower z-score and is more likely to last at least 1 hour.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes. Therefore, the probability that a fuse from Company II will last at least 1 hour is higher than the probability for Company I.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The range represents the difference between the largest and smallest values, which is 50. Therefore, the mean should be close to the average of these two numbers, which is (200 + 50) / 2 = 125. This suggests that the mean is likely around 125, making option A incorrect. Additionally, the median is the middle value when the set is assorted in ascending order. Therefore, option D is also incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the range is 50 and the largest value is 200, the smallest value must be 150. This suggests that the mean is likely greater than 165, considering the values are spread out.
