D,"Let's reason step by step. The given argument claims that if X is true, and Y and Z are also true, then the conclusion ~X must be valid. However, this premise is invalid because the truth of an implication does not depend solely on the truth values of its individual components. There could exist scenarios where both Y and Z are true while X is false, rendering the conclusion invalid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If all the premises are true, then the conclusion, ~X, must also be true. Therefore, if X, Y, and Z are true, the argument is invalid because it contradicts the conclusion. The correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The provided sentence describes a situation where a person has resided in the same home for the entire duration of their life. This suggests a prolonged period of time, potentially exceeding one year. Option C accurately represents this scenario with the appropriate parentheses and grouping symbols.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence states that if a person was born or died and lived in your home, then they lived with you. So, the symbolization is (B ∨ D • H) ⊃ L. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument claims that ~I implies ~J. However, this premise is indirect and relies on the assumption that the truth values of propositions determine the validity of an argument. This assumption may not hold in all cases.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, we need the first premise to be true and the conclusion false. So, H must be true and I must be true. However, if H is true and I is true, then J cannot be false. Therefore, this argument is invalid.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The provided sentence expresses a conditional relationship between two events. We need to determine the antecedent (condition) and the consequent (result). In this case, the antecedent is 'England's importing beef' and the consequent is 'China's promoting human rights.' Therefore, the best symbolization of this sentence is (E \u2261 F) \u2228 (~C \u2283 S).",A,"Let's reason step by step. England's importing beef being a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture means that if France subsidizes agriculture, then England must import beef. This translates to (F ⊃ E). Conversely, China promoting human rights not being a sufficient condition for South Africa's supplying diamonds means that if South Africa does not supply diamonds, then China cannot promote human rights.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument claims that if the statement ~T implies ~U, and conversely, if ~W, then the conclusion ~X follows. However, this premise is invalid. Counterexamples can be constructed where T, X, and Z are true while U and W are false, or vice versa. Therefore, the argument is invalid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Since '~W' appears in several premises, let's make W true. Then, to make the second premise true, X must also be true. Therefore, the argument is invalid with a counterexample when T, X, and Z are true and U and W are false.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement expresses a universal quantification over all birds. Therefore, the translation into predicate logic should use universal quantifiers. Option A is incorrect because it uses specific quantification within the universal quantification. Option B is incorrect because it mixes different types of quantifications. Option C is incorrect because it includes an additional condition within the universal quantification. Option D is incorrect because it uses different quantifiers than the intended one.",A,"Let's reason step by step. 'All birds' suggests a universal quantifier for birds, so we start with (∀x). Then, 'live in some nest' implies an existential quantifier for nests, so we add (∃y). Combining these two gives us the first translation. The other options are incorrect because they use different quantifiers or fail to capture the essence of the sentence.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The antecedent of this proposition is 'The Bees win their first game'. This is because the conclusion must be true if the premise is true. Therefore, the answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence talks about the Chipmunks not winning their first game, which suggests this is a condition for the Bees winning their first game. Therefore, the antecedent is the statement that either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given argument involves a conditional statement ~E \u2228 F. This statement claims that if condition E is true, then the result F must also be true. However, this premise is invalid because the truth of an implication does not depend solely on the truth values of its individual components. Therefore, there can exist scenarios where the premise is true but the conclusion F is false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (E) must be true. Since the second premise (~F) is also true, the first premise (~E ∨ F) must be false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument proposes a chain of consequences regarding the abolishment of capital punishment. If we abolish it, overcrowded prisons will necessitate the construction of additional facilities. This suggests that abolishing capital punishment leads to an escalation in prison population, ultimately justifying its continuation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts by stating that if we abolish capital punishment, prisons will become more crowded. This sets the stage for the consequences of such an action. Additionally, overcrowding can lead to increased costs and challenges in managing the prison population. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that abolishing capital punishment will likely result in more crowded prisons.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement asserts that not all members of a certain class (lobsters) possess a specific characteristic (red color). Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is option B: ~(\u2203x)(Lx \u2283 Rx)"".",B,"Let's reason step by step. 'Not all' implies negating the statement 'all lobsters are red'. This translates to negating the universal quantifier and the conjunction, resulting in ~(∀x)(Lx • Rx). Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement expresses a conditional relationship between individuals (x, y) and their actions (helping). We can translate this into predicate logic as: If x is kind (Kx), then if y is endangered (Sy), then someone (Px) is helpful to them (Hx). Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a connection between kind people helping endangered species. This suggests an implication, where the existence of kind people and endangered species leads to the act of helping. Therefore, the correct translation is B: ((\u2203x)(\u2203y){[(Kx \u2022 Sx) \u2022 (Ey \u2022 Py)] \u2022 Hxy}.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement expresses a conditional relationship between the presence of robbers (Rx), money (y), and banks (x). Option A directly translates this into predicate logic using quantifiers. Option B translates it using parentheses and explicit quantification. Option C employs nested parentheses and mentions specific objects involved in the action. Option D uses parentheses and mentions general entities, making it more abstract.",A,"Let's reason step by step. 'Some robbers' suggests an existential quantifier for robbers, so we start with (∃x). Then, 'steal money from a bank' implies existential quantifiers for both money and bank, so we add (∃y)(∃z). Combining these two parts gives us the first translation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument claims that ~M implies N. However, this premise is invalid because the truth values of M and N can be independent. For example, if M is true (meaning M is true) and O is true (meaning O is true), but N is false, then the argument would still be valid despite the inconsistency between M and N.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (N) must be false. Since the second premise includes '~M', let's make M true. This would make the first premise true regardless of the value of N. Therefore, a counterexample exists when M is true and O and N are false.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first proposition states that the conjunction of G and H is true. The second proposition states that G is true. Therefore, the two propositions are logically equivalent. This means they have the same truth value.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Applying De Morgan's Law to the first proposition, we get ~(G ⊃ H) • ~~H, which simplifies to (~G • ~H) • H. This looks similar to the second proposition (~G ⊃ G), suggesting they might be contradictory. Therefore, these statements are logically inconsistent.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement involves a conditional relationship between Cecilia and Maria. 'If' Maria is either a problem or a girl, then 'then' Cecilia breaks 'my heart'. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2022 Gm).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Cecilia breaking my heart and Maria being a problem and a girl. This translates to an 'if-then' statement with a conjunction. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is B: Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2022 Gm).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided formula involves logical operators and variable assignments. Choice B is incorrect because it includes conditions that are not logically connected. Choice C is incorrect because it interprets the formula incorrectly based on the order of operations. Choice D is incorrect because it focuses solely on one aspect of the formula without considering the implications of other variables. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The formula suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by, leading to Russell making dinner. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The antecedent of this conditional proposition is that the university either raises tuition or both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence mentions the governor approving of the tuition raise as a condition, suggesting this is the antecedent of the conditional proposition. Therefore, the answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement asserts that Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name. In predicate logic, this translates to: 'If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad.' Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is B: 'Bl \u2261 Sk'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that DJ Khaled shouting Leroy's name is a sufficient condition for Leroy being bad. This translates to (Sk ≡ Bl). Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is B: Bl ≡ Sk.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument claims that if E, F, and G are all true, then the conclusion ~E must be valid. However, this premise is invalid because it assumes specific conditions without providing any evidence to support them. Therefore, a counterexample where E, F, and G are true but ~E is false can disprove the argument.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion must be false. Since the conclusion includes negations, let's make both ~G and ~E false, meaning G and E are true. This leads to F being true but E being false. Therefore, the argument is invalid.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The premise (A \u2228 B) suggests the presence of at least one condition that supports B. However, the consequent (C) requires the absence of a specific condition. Therefore, this argument is invalid because it lacks a complete definition of what constitutes the supporting condition and the absence of that condition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (D ⊃ A) must be false. This means D must be true and A must be false. Since the second premise involves ~D, let's make C false as well. Now, with B being true, the argument becomes invalid.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument claims that ~C implies D. However, this premise is invalid because the truth values of C and D are independent. For example, C could be true (indicating a parasitic infection) while D is false (no infection present). Therefore, the argument cannot guarantee the presence of an infection merely based on the elevated eosinophil count.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (C) must be false. Since the second premise (D ⊃ C) has C as the consequent, let's make D true to potentially make the second premise true. Now, with C being false, the first premise becomes invalid, rendering the entire argument invalid.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement expresses a conditional relationship between animals and people. 'Some animals are neglected by cruel people'. We can translate this into predicate logic as (Ax ∧ Cx) → Py. This is because Ax represents some animal, Cx represents cruel person, and Py represents neglecting. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a relationship between animals and cruel people. This suggests an existential quantifier for both, so we start with (∃x)(∃y). x represents some animal and y represents some person who is cruel. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given sentence expresses a conditional relationship between the enrollment of Harry and George. Using formula (C), we can depict this as (H ~ (G \u2283 J)). This indicates that if either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll, then Jim will definitely enroll.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that either Harry enrolls or George doesn't enroll, but not both, so we use the exclusive disjunction symbol. Therefore, the best symbolization is B: ~(H \u2228 G) \u2283 J.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given propositions involve logical connectives and quantifiers. We need to analyze each one separately:\n- (N \u2283 ~O) implies that the negation of N is equivalent to O. This suggests the existence of O, which aligns with B.\n- (O \u2228 Q) indicates that O is contained within Q. Since we don't have information about Q, this proposition remains valid regardless of the value of O.\nTherefore, the only immediate consequence in PL is that O exists, making answer B correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second premise states that P implies (N ⊃ ~O), and since the third premise affirms N ⊃ P, we can directly infer (N ⊃ ~O). Therefore, the immediate consequence in this particular case is the negation of O.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given propositions involve logical operators like NOT, AND, and OR. We need to evaluate each proposition individually to determine if the entire set is consistent.\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) implies that the opposite of N is O and P is true. This aligns with option B.\n~O \u2283 Q implies that O is true and Q is false. This aligns with option C.\nTherefore, the set is consistent and has a consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If N, O, and P are true, then ~N is false, (O · P) is true, and ~O is false, making the first two premises true. Since N and ~Q are true, the third premise is also true. Therefore, the set is consistent with the valuation C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement asserts that no entities are classified as ""people."" Option B utilizes logical symbols in a way that aligns with this meaning. Therefore, the best translation is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for every x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person, so we use the universal quantifier and the conjunction symbol. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given premises suggest a conditional relationship between Delilah, Juana, and Layla. If Delilah is in New York City, then Juana is either in Bogota or Layla is in San Juan. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is Dn \u2261 (Bx \u2022 Ly).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that Delilah being in New York City is equivalent to both Juana being in Bogota and Layla being in San Juan, so we use the biconditional and conjunction symbols.
