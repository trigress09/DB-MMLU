Among the options, Bismuth (B) is not a common dopant in germanium and cannot be used as such to make an n-type semiconductor.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Arsenic is in the same group as gallium and indium, which are known p-type dopants for germanium. Therefore, arsenic should also be a p-type dopant. The correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first law of thermodynamics states that the total energy in a closed system remains constant. Therefore, the amount of work input to the system must be equal to the amount of heat extracted from the outdoor environment. Accordingly, the smallest amount of work required is 1,100 J.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The work done by the heat pump is the difference between the heat delivered indoors and the heat extracted outdoors. So, the work done should be 15,000 J - (15,000 J * (7/27)) = 11,111 J, which is approximately 500 J. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The quantum numbers describe the electron's angular momentum and magnetic moment in an atom. In this case, l = 2 indicates that the electron is in the second energy level. The number of allowed values for m_l depends on the value of l, which is 2. Therefore, the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The quantum number m_l can take on values from -l to +l, including 0. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which gives us a total of 2 values. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The fundamental frequency of an organ pipe is determined by its length and material properties. In this case, the pipe has a fundamental frequency of C (131 Hz). The next higher harmonic will be the second harmonic, which corresponds to twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic is 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The next higher harmonic is typically twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic should be 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz. The answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The average total energy of a system is related to its temperature through the formula E = (1/2) kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant. Therefore, the answer should be (3/2) kT.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. A harmonic oscillator has one degree of freedom, so the average total energy should be (1/2)kT. Therefore, the answer is (C)",C
