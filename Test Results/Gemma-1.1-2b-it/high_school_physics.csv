B,"Let's reason step by step. When an object is moved from far away to near the focal point of a concave mirror, the image formed on the opposite side of the mirror will appear smaller than the object. This occurs because the converging nature of the mirror causes the reflected rays to converge at a shorter distance.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The force exerted by the floor on the ball during the impact can be calculated using the equation F = ma. We know that the ball starts with zero velocity and ends with a final velocity of 0 m/s, so the change in momentum is -0.08 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 = -0.76 kg m/s.

As the temperature increases, the balloon expands, and as the temperature decreases, the balloon contracts. This means that the volume and temperature have an indirect relationship, so C^3 and T should also have an indirect relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The net force on the rod is zero, which means the total torque acting on the rod must also be zero. Therefore, either F1 and F2 must have equal magnitude and opposite directions, or they must be applied at the same point to create a net torque of zero.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the net force on the bar is zero, then according to Newton's first law, the bar cannot accelerate. This means that the bar cannot accelerate translationally or rotationally, so the net torque must also be zero. Therefore, the answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The flow rate Q is solely determined by the diameter of the pipe and the velocity of the fluid. Therefore, the flow speed at another point in the pipe with a different diameter will be proportional to the square root of the ratio of the new and old diameters. Applying this principle, we find that the flow speed at 3 cm should be 6 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the diameter at the second point is 1.5 times larger than at the first point, the flow speed should be 1.5 times slower. Therefore, the flow speed at the second point is 18 m/s / 1.5 = 4 m/s. The answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The change in the beam of monochromatic light as it enters the glass pane is primarily due to a shift in its speed upon transitioning from air into glass. This change in speed alters the frequency and wavelength components of the light, resulting in the observed dispersion effect.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The frequency of light is determined by its source and remains constant regardless of the medium it passes through. However, the speed of light changes as it enters a different medium, which in turn affects its wavelength. Therefore, the change in speed will cause a shift in the observed wavelength.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to conservation of mechanical energy, the total mechanical energy at the top and bottom of the incline remains constant. Therefore, the final kinetic energy of the object at the bottom must be equal to its initial potential energy when released. This implies that the work done by friction must be equal to the change in kinetic energy, which supports choice C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  The total mechanical energy of the system should remain constant. As the object slides down, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. While some energy is lost to thermal energy due to friction, the gain in kinetic energy compensates for this loss, resulting in equal potential and kinetic energy at the bottom. Therefore, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The magnetic field B exerts a force on moving charged particles, causing them to bend in the direction of the field. The radius of the circular path is related to the force and the speed of the particle as well as the strength of the magnetic field. Applying these relationships allows us to determine the radius of the circular path.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The radius of the circular path of a charged particle in a magnetic field is inversely proportional to the strength of the field and the velocity of the particle. Given the relatively low magnetic field of the Earth and the high velocity of the electrons, the radius of the circle will be very small, on the order of nanometers. Therefore, the answer is 1 nm.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The photoelectric effect occurs when light interacts with a material, causing an electron to be emitted from the material. The energy of the emitted electron is equal to the difference between the work function of the material and the photon's energy. In this case, the work function of the metal plate is 2 eV. Therefore, the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons will be 2 eV. This means that the current through the resistor will be very small, close to zero.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The power of the light source directly corresponds to the energy of the emitted photons per unit time. This energy is then used to eject electrons from the metal plate, generating a current. Therefore, the current through the resistor should be proportional to the power of the light, approximately 6 A for a 100 W light source. The answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for capacitance is Q = CV, where Q represents charge, C represents capacitance, and V represents voltage. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate can be calculated as Q = 2 mF * 5 V = 10 μC. Therefore, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The charge on a capacitor plate is directly proportional to the potential difference across the plates. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate is 5 V * 2 mF = 0.005 C. The answer is A.",A
