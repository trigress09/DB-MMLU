B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle cells rely on ATP for energy during exercise. The storage of ATP in muscle is limited, and its breakdown rate is high during high-intensity exercise. Therefore, the available ATP supply is insufficient to sustain sustained high-intensity exercise for an extended period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. ATP stores in muscles are limited but can be rapidly replenished through various metabolic pathways.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of an object is the result of the gravitational force pulling it down and the friction acting on it. The equation for acceleration is a = g (sin ? \u2013 \u00b5 cos ?), where ? represents the angle of incline.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of the object is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it down the incline and the frictional force opposing its motion.
