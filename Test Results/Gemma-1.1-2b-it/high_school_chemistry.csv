Therefore, we can calculate the pH as follows: pH = -log([H+]) = -log(1.8 \u00d7 10^-5) ≈ 4.74. The correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium ethanoate is a salt formed from a weak acid (ethanoic acid) and a strong base (sodium hydroxide), so the solution should be neutral with a pH of 7. Therefore, the answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The pH value of 4.26 suggests that the weak acid is slightly acidic. To determine the pKa, we can use the equation: pKa = -log([HA]/[A-]). Plugging in the given values, we get pKa ≈ 7.92. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pH measures the concentration of H+ ions, and the pKa is related to the dissociation of the acid, the pKa should be double the pH value. Therefore, the pKa of this weak acid is 8.52.",B
