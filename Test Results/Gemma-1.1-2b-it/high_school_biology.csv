Therefore, all phenotypic variation is the result of genetic variation.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Genetic similarity reflects evolutionary relationships, and the degree of similarity can provide insights into how closely related two organisms are. If two organisms are distantly related, it suggests they share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related species. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

While CO2 and O2 are crucial for respiration, a decrease in the plasma pH level is not directly related to respiratory regulation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A decrease in plasma pH indicates higher acidity, which is often associated with increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production during respiration. This suggests that the body is working harder to regulate its internal pH balance, potentially in response to strenuous exercise or other factors.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mules are a hybrid species formed through the mating of an African donkey and a European horse. As a result of this interbreeding, mules inherit some genetic traits from each parent species while also exhibiting unique characteristics. Therefore, mules cannot perform successful meiosis, which is essential for passing on their genetic material to future generations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since mules cannot undergo meiosis, their DNA cannot be shuffled and recombined, so mutations are unable to occur and introduce new genetic variation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
