D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 20% of the workers will no longer be at their position after one year, which means that 80% of them will still be there. Then, we know that only 5% of those remaining leave during the next year, which means that 95% of them stay.

After the first year, 20% of the 200 workers will have left, leaving 160.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that 30% of potential jurors are women, and we need to find the probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 meets the requirement of having at least three women. To do this, we can use the complementary probability approach. Let's first calculate the probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 does not have at least three women. This is equivalent to calculating the probability that all nine remaining positions on the jury are occupied by men. We can calculate this probability as follows: (1 - 0.3)^(9) = 0.168. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 does not have at least three women is 0.168. The complementary probability, which is the probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 has at least three women, is therefore 1 - 0.168 = 0.832. Finally, we can calculate the exact probability that a randomly selected jury of 12 has at least three women as follows: P(at least 3 women) = 1 - P(no more than 2 women) = 1 - (9 choose 0 + 9 choose 1 + 9 choose 2) / (12 choose 12) = 0.832.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

The description mentions that the population is divided into groups of 35 and each group has an equal chance of being selected. This sounds like a cluster sample.

To establish cause-and-effect relationships, we need to identify the variables involved and determine whether changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. A complete census would not be useful in establishing cause-and-effect relationships because it does not provide information about the relationships between variables. On the other hand, a least squares regression line showing high correlation would suggest that there is a strong relationship between the variables involved, but it would not establish causality.

The number of students present in a class is a count of individuals, with each student either present or absent. This is similar to the other options, so a binomial model is appropriate. However, there are some subtle differences between this scenario and the others. For example, in option A, we are counting the number of heads in three tosses of a coin. In this case, the outcome is not just a count of individuals, but also has a probabilistic nature. Similarly, in options B and C, we are dealing with outcomes that have a natural ordering or ranking, such as the number of rainy days in a week or the number of girls in a family.

In the New Jersey office, there are 128 office assistants with a mean salary of $28,500. So, the total salary in this office is 128 x $28,500 = $3,648,000. Similarly, in the Utah office, there are 32 office assistants with a mean salary of $22,500. So, the total salary in this office is 32 x $22,500 = $720,000.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a Type II error (β) can be calculated using the formula: β = P(Type II error). Since we are conducting a hypothesis test at the 10% significance level (α = 0.10), we need to find the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This probability is equal to the probability of a Type II error (β). Using the formula for β, we can calculate the probability of a Type II error as follows: β = P(Type II error) = P(Reject H0 | H0 is true) = 1 - P(Type I error) = 1 - α = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 Therefore, the probability of a Type II error (β) is equal to 0.90.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the sample means is a measure of the spread of the sample means around the population mean.

Option A, p + q > 1, is possible because we can choose values for p and q that satisfy this condition. Similarly, options B and C are also possible because they only require the existence of certain values for p and q.

However, it's impossible for the product of two probabilities (p / q) to be greater than 1 because the product of two numbers cannot exceed the maximum value of either number.

Now, using the formula for the probability mass function of a binomial distribution, we get P(X = 0) = (7 choose 0) * (2/7)^0 * (5/7)^7. Simplifying this expression, we get P(X = 0) = (1/1) * (1) * (3125/78125). Now, simplifying further, we get P(X = 0) = 3125/78125.

For the t-test to be valid, one of the assumptions that must be met is that the population standard deviations at both locations are equal. This assumption is necessary because the t-test relies on the fact that the sample means are representative of the population means. If the population standard deviations are not equal, then the sample means may not be representative of the population means, and the t-test would not be valid.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The survey conducted by the local newspaper found that 58 percent of respondents were against the annexation. However, during the actual vote, only 56 percent of the respondents voted against the annexation. This difference is due to nonresponse bias, which occurs when individuals with particular characteristics are more likely to refuse to answer a survey question. In this case, it is possible that some individuals who were against the annexation refused to participate in the survey, resulting in an overestimation of opposition to the annexation.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a hypothesis test is directly related to the sample size, significance level, and probability of Type II error. Increasing the sample size (I) will increase the power of the test because it provides more information about the population. Increasing the significance level (II) will also increase the power of the test because it sets a lower threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. However, increasing the probability of Type II error (III) will decrease the power of the test because it increases the likelihood of failing to detect a true effect. Therefore, options I and II are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size provides more data and reduces sampling error, leading to a higher power to detect a true effect.

We can eliminate options A, B, and C because they are all advantages of stratified random sampling over simple random sampling. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified random sampling ensures representation from all strata, providing information about each subgroup and the overall population, which simple random sampling doesn't necessarily achieve. Therefore, option D is incorrect.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. An experiment is a type of research in which the researcher manipulates some variable, known as an independent variable, and measures its effect on another variable, known as a dependent variable. In contrast, an observational study is a type of research in which the researcher observes and records the behavior or characteristics of individuals or groups without manipulating any variables. The primary difference between an experiment and an observational study is that experiments involve manipulation of variables to test hypotheses, whereas observational studies do not involve manipulation of variables.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The main difference lies in the use of control and treatment groups; while both methods utilize these groups, experiments require randomization to ensure unbiased results, whereas observational studies don't. This is the primary difference between an experiment and an observational study.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval (7.58, 8.72) is a range within which we are 95 percent confident that the true mean weight of oranges of this variety lies. This means that if we were to repeat this sampling process many times, about 95 percent of the intervals constructed would contain the true mean weight of oranges of this variety. Therefore, statement A is true with respect to the confidence level used.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of oranges from this variety will fall within the weight range of 7.58 to 8.72 ounces. This is a statement about the population, not the sample.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value is a statistical measure that represents the probability of observing a result as extreme or more extreme than the one actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it's the probability of getting a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed test statistic, if the null hypothesis is true. This makes sense because if the P-value is small, it means that the result is unlikely to occur by chance alone, and therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value represents the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it's actually false, indicating the likelihood of a Type II error. Therefore, the best description of a P-value is: 'The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is, in fact, false.'",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We have three options: Option I gives a sure return of $25,000; Option II has two possible outcomes with equal probability, one being a return of $50,000 and the other being a return of $10,000; Option III also has two possible outcomes, but with unequal probabilities, one being a return of $100,000 with 5% chance and the other being no return with 95% chance. To maximize expected return, we should choose the option that has the highest expected value. In this case, Option II has an expected value of ($50,000 x 0.5) + ($10,000 x 0.5) = $25,000 + $5,000 = $30,000. Option III also has an expected value of (0.05 x $100,000) + (0.95 x $0) = $5,000 + $0 = $5,000. Therefore, the option that maximizes expected return is Option II with an expected return of $30,000.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To maximize expected return, the company should choose Option II, as it has the highest average potential return of $30,000 compared to the other options. However, if the company needs at least $20,000 to pay off an overdue loan, then Option I would be a better choice. Similarly, if the company needs at least $80,000 to pay off an overdue loan, then Option III would be a better choice.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The study is examining the effect of music on worker productivity. Every change in music resulted in an increase in production, which suggests that the observed effect is not due to chance or sampling error. This is an example of the placebo effect, where a treatment (in this case, changing the music) has a positive effect on the outcome (worker productivity).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Each change in music genre acts as a separate treatment unit, and the observed increase in production is a direct result of the specific music played each day. This is an example of the effect of a treatment unit.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to construct a 94% confidence interval for a population proportion. To do this, we will use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) with a critical value corresponding to our desired level of confidence. The formula for the upper critical value is: z = Φ^(-1)(1 - α/2), where Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and α is the desired level of significance. In this case, we want a 94% confidence interval, so α = 0.06. Plugging in these values, we get: z = Φ^(-1)(1 - 0.06/2) ≈ 1.88. Therefore, the upper critical value for our desired level of confidence is approximately 1.88.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a 94% confidence interval, we need to find the z-score that leaves 3% in each tail, which corresponds to a critical value of 1.555. Therefore, the upper critical value of z is 1.555.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that 60% of the electronic parts last over 3 years, while 70% last less than 6 years. This means that 40% of the parts do not last over 3 years, and 30% do not last less than 6 years. The mean length of life is the sum of the lengths of life divided by the total number of parts. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean. In this case, we can calculate the mean and standard deviation using the given information.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Since 70% of parts last less than 6 years, the standard deviation should be around (6-3)/3 = 1 year. Therefore, we can assume a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation that are close to those given in option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The claim is that over 60 percent of the mall's visitors shop at that store. This means that the proportion of visitors who shop at the store, denoted as p, must be greater than or equal to 0.60.

To support the claim that over 60% of visitors shop at the store, the null hypothesis should state that the proportion is less than or equal to 60%, while the alternative hypothesis claims it's greater than 60%. This way, if the data supports the claim, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that more than 60% of visitors shop at the store.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The clinical trial is designed to compare the effectiveness of the currently marketed medicine versus the experimental medicine. The patients are randomly assigned to one of these two groups, which means that each patient has an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

This study involves pairing the currently marketed medicine with the experimental medicine, where each patient's response to both treatments is compared, making it a matched-pairs design. Therefore, the correct answer is B: a matched-pairs design.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. When we change from a 90% confidence interval estimate to a 99% confidence interval estimate, with all other things being equal, the interval size will increase because the new interval is wider than the original one. The correct answer is C, which states that the interval size increases by 57%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% requires a wider interval to capture a larger range of possible values, resulting in a 9% increase in interval size. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, even if the underlying population is not normally distributed. This means that as the sample size increases, the shape of the sampling distribution becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped, which is characteristic of a normal distribution. Therefore, option B is correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. This means that I is true. Additionally, the central limit theorem also states that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is equal to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. This means that II is true. Finally, the central limit theorem only applies when the sample size is large enough. Therefore, III is not always true.",B

Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes. Additionally, the standard deviation for Company II is smaller than that of Company I, which means that the actual burning times for Company II's fuses will be closer to their mean value of 55 minutes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The largest value is 200, and the range is 50. This means that the smallest value must be 150 (since 200 - 50 = 150). Now, we can calculate the mean: (150 + 175 + ? + 200) / 4 = 185. Since the mean is greater than 165, option B is true.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the range is 50 and the largest value is 200, the smallest value must be 150. This suggests that the mean is likely greater than 165, considering the values are spread out.

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. We have a sample of 50 politicians with a mean cost of $125,000 and a standard deviation of $32,000. To construct a 90% confidence interval for the average cost of running for office, we can use the formula: CI = (x̄ - EBM, x̄ + EBM), where x̄ is the sample mean, EBM is the error bound for the margin of error, and CI is the confidence interval. Since we want a 90% confidence interval, we need to find the value of z that corresponds to a probability of 0.05 (since 1 - 0.05 = 0.95). From a standard normal distribution table or calculator, we can find that the z-score corresponding to a probability of 0.05 is approximately 1.645. Now, we can use this value of z to calculate the error bound for the margin of error (EBM) as follows: EBM = z * (σ / √n), where σ is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size. In our case, we have a sample mean of $125,000, a sample standard deviation of $32,000, and a sample size of 50. We can plug these values into the formula for EBM: EBM = z * (σ / √n)",-,"Let's reason step by step. A 90% confidence interval indicates that there's a 90% chance that politicians running for office spend between $117,500 and $132,500.
