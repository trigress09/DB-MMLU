D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about a study conducted by Patterson in Brixton. The correct answer should be based on the information provided in the study. From the options, option D 'all of the above' seems to be the most accurate answer as it encompasses all the possible outcomes mentioned in the other options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about what Patterson found, and his study primarily focused on the social dynamics between different communities, particularly the resentment of white communities towards black families. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's concept of the 'spirit of capitalism' refers to the cultural and social attitudes that underpin capitalist systems. According to Weber, this spirit can be traced back to inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas during the Reformation. These groups emphasized individual salvation through faith and good works, which in turn led to a sense of inner-worldly asceticism. This asceticism was characterized by a rejection of worldly pleasures and a focus on hard work, thrift, and self-discipline. It is this spirit of capitalism that Weber believed could be traced back to inspirational Protestant groups during the Reformation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's concept of the 'spirit of capitalism' is closely tied to the rise of Protestantism, specifically the influence of inspirational Protestant groups who revived religious ideas and encouraged hard work and thrift. This spirit of capitalism was characterized by a strong work ethic, individualism, and a focus on material success.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The post-war welfare state of 1948 aimed to provide a comprehensive range of social and economic benefits to its citizens. Among these, the welfare state did not aim to provide universal welfare. Instead, it focused on providing targeted support to specific groups, such as the elderly, children, and people with disabilities.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The post-war welfare state aimed to provide a safety net for all citizens, encompassing various aspects like healthcare, education, and general welfare, so it must have included a minimum wage as well. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'a minimum wage'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Covert participant observation is a research method where the researcher observes and participates in the activities of the group or community being studied, without revealing their true intentions or identity. One of the ethical problems with this approach is that it can lead to deception, as the participants may not be aware of the researcher's true intentions or identity. This can potentially harm the relationships between the researcher and the participants, and also undermine the validity and reliability of the research findings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ethical concern with covert observation lies in the fact that it involves studying individuals outside of their natural setting, which can lead to inaccurate or biased results. Additionally, covert observation may also involve deceiving respondents as to the purpose of the research, which raises concerns about informed consent and participant autonomy.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'collective consumption' was coined by Manuel Castells in his book 'The Urban Question: A Marxist Approach' published in 1977. Collective consumption refers to the way in which people consume goods and services as a group, rather than individually. This concept is closely related to the idea of public goods and services, which are provided by the state or other collective entities. Therefore, option D 'the provision of health, housing, and education services by the state' is the most accurate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'collective consumption' seems related to a specific type of illness, possibly a form of tuberculosis, that affects individuals who engage in collecting activities, like stamps. This is not the correct answer, as it does not match the definition provided by Castells.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Theories of racialized discourse suggest that race is not an objective biological category, but rather a socially constructed concept used to categorize people based on physical characteristics such as skin color, hair texture, and facial features. This means that the idea of race is not fixed or natural, but rather it is shaped by social, political, economic, and cultural factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Theories of racialized discourse primarily explore the historical development of race relations, particularly in the context of colonialism and its lasting impact on societies like Britain and America. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Fordist forms of media production and consumption involve a shift away from the mass production of standardized products for passive audiences, as described in option A. Instead, post-Fordist media production involves a diverse range of products aimed at niche markets, as described in option C. This is because post-Fordist media consumers are no longer passive recipients of information, but rather active participants who demand customized and personalized content.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Post-Fordist media production is characterized by the mass production of standardized products, such as popular films and television shows, that are aimed at passive audiences who consume them without much critical engagement. In contrast, pre-Fordist forms of media production were more artisanal and focused on producing unique and high-quality products for niche markets.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson believed that psychiatry was an outmoded form of treatment and should be replaced by alternative therapies. They argued that the traditional approach to mental health, which focused on biological or chemical imbalances in the brain, was too narrow and failed to take into account the complex social and cultural factors that contribute to mental illness. In this sense, anti-psychiatrists like Laing & Esterson were arguing for a more holistic and humanistic approach to mental health treatment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anti-psychiatrists like Laing and Esterson believed that mental illnesses have a biological origin, making it unnecessary to delve into the subjective experiences and 'the mind' of the patient. Instead, they advocated for an understanding of mental illness as a response to disturbed patterns of family interaction.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking why society cannot be studied in the same way as the natural world. This implies that there are fundamental differences between studying human societies and studying the natural world. One of these key differences is that human behavior is meaningful, and varies between individuals and cultures. This means that sociologists must take into account the subjective experiences and meanings that people assign to their actions and behaviors. In contrast, the natural world can be studied through empirical observation and measurement, without needing to consider subjective meanings or interpretations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The study of society differs from the natural world because sociologists often lack the necessary rationality and critical approach required for rigorous scientific investigation. Additionally, human behavior is inherently complex and context-dependent, making it challenging to develop universally applicable theories or laws. Therefore, the study of society requires a more nuanced and multidisciplinary approach that acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties inherent in social phenomena.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The study suggests that men do the most housework when... . This implies that there is a specific condition under which men are more likely to take on household responsibilities. Given the options, it seems most plausible that this condition is 'they had rediscovered themselves as  'new men''",A,"Let's reason step by step. The invention of convenient household appliances like hoovers and electric irons likely played a significant role in encouraging men to contribute more to housework. This is because these appliances made it easier for men to perform tasks that were previously considered women's work, such as cleaning and ironing.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization occurred in the nineteenth century because industrial capitalism led to a shift of population from rural to urban areas. As industries such as textiles and manufacturing emerged, they created new job opportunities in cities, drawing people away from their traditional rural way of life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization in the nineteenth century was primarily driven by the increasing planning and management of towns and cities, which attracted people to urban centers with better infrastructure and organization. This is evident from the fact that many European cities underwent significant transformations during this period, with the construction of new buildings, roads, and public spaces.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fulcher & Scott identify community as a social structure that is characterized by certain criteria. One of the criteria they mention is 'a shared sense of identity and belonging together'. This criterion suggests that community is not just about physical proximity or shared activities, but also about a sense of shared identity and belonging. Therefore, option A is not identified by Fulcher & Scott as a criterion of community.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While shared identity and common activities are important for a community, collective action based on common interests is less relevant as it often involves temporary alliances rather than a sense of belonging. On the other hand, a fixed geographical location is not necessarily a criterion for community. Therefore, the correct answer is D: collective action based on common interests.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Laqueur (1990) identified the 'two-sex' model, which is a concept that distinguishes between two sexes: male and female. This model represents a significant departure from earlier models of human sexuality, which often emphasized the idea of a single, universal sex.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'two-sex' model described by Laqueur likely presented women's genitalia as underdeveloped or inferior versions of men's, highlighting a perspective of male superiority in anatomical terms. This is reflected in option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Durkheim's work, the term 'collective representations' refers to shared ideas and moral values that are widely recognized within a society or group. These collective representations can be symbolized by an object, figurehead, or even a ceremony. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Durkheim's concept of 'collective representations' refers to widely recognized images of gods or totems that serve as symbols of shared beliefs and values within a society. These collective representations can take many forms, such as rituals, myths, or even physical objects like statues or icons.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The middle classes that developed over the nineteenth century were characterized by their urban nature, involvement in civic bodies and voluntary associations, and 'white collar' work. Therefore, option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The middle classes that emerged in the nineteenth century were primarily characterized as an urban set, actively involved in civic bodies and voluntary associations, reflecting their engagement in city life. This is evident from the fact that they were often involved in 'white collar' work, which further reinforces their connection to urban society.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Émile Durkheim was a French sociologist who is considered one of the founders of modern sociology. He believed that the primary focus of sociology should be on understanding social facts, which are objective and observable aspects of society. This approach emphasizes the importance of studying social structures and institutions in order to understand how they shape individual behavior and social outcomes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Durkheim's primary focus in sociology was on understanding cultural dynamics, including the values, beliefs, and practices that shape social life and influence individual behavior. He believed that these cultural dynamics were the foundation of social order and stability, and that they played a crucial role in shaping human society.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Goldthorpe's concept of the 'service class' refers to a group of people who are not part of the traditional working class or the capitalist class. They are characterized by their non-manual occupations, exercising authority on behalf of the state. This definition is in line with the original concept of the service class as described by Goldthorpe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Goldthorpe's concept of the 'service class' likely refers to individuals who have served in the armed forces, bringing their experience and skills to various non-manual occupations. This would include those working in consultancy firms, as well as those exercising authority on behalf of the state.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Weber said that all knowledge is 'value-relevant'. This means that knowledge is not just a neutral collection of facts, but rather it is shaped and influenced by people's values and beliefs. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'theorists interpret the world in terms of their own values'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's assertion that all knowledge is 'value-relevant' means that knowledge is inherently connected to people and their values, as it reflects human understanding and interpretation of the world. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'knowledge refers to people and their values'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Marx believed that religion would disappear when people became aware of the contradictions between their economic conditions and the ideology of capitalism. In other words, as people become more aware of the exploitation and alienation caused by capitalist systems, they will begin to reject the ideologies that justify these systems, including religious beliefs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Marx predicted that religion would fade away when church attendance dropped significantly, indicating a decline in religious belief and practice among the population. This prediction is based on Marx's theory of alienation, which posits that as people become more industrialized and urbanized, they will become increasingly disconnected from their true human nature and will seek meaning and fulfillment through external sources such as material possessions, social status, or religion.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term inter-generational mobility refers to the movement of individuals from one generation to another into different occupational categories or social classes. This can include upward mobility, where an individual moves up the social ladder, or downward mobility, where an individual moves down the social ladder. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: movement into different occupational categories between generations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Inter-generational mobility refers to the phenomenon where individuals move into higher occupational categories than their parents, reflecting upward social mobility across generations. This concept is distinct from inter-personal mobility, which refers to movement within a person's lifetime.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Max Weber, a German sociologist, argued that the state's monopoly on the use of force is legitimated by rational-legal authority. This means that the state's power is based on its ability to enforce laws and regulations through its institutions and officials.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Value-rational authority is based on a belief in the legality of enacted rules and the right of those elevated to authority under such rules to issue commands. Weber believed that this type of authority was legitimated by the fact that it was based on a rational-legal system, where laws are enacted through a formal process and are applied equally to all citizens.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Decarceration refers to a reduction in the number of people incarcerated. The trend of decarceration involves community alternatives to imprisonment and institutional care, which means that instead of imprisoning individuals, communities are providing alternative forms of support and rehabilitation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Decarceration implies a move away from state-run facilities, which suggests transferring management to private companies for efficiency. This is not about decentralizing organization or increasing imprisonment rates. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: transferring the management of prisons to private companies.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the effect of the Internet upon the public sphere. The correct answer should reflect how the Internet has impacted the way people interact and communicate in the public sphere. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'revive it, by reaffirming a commitment to freedom of speech'. This answer reflects how the Internet has enabled people to express themselves more freely and widely than ever before.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The internet offers a more accessible and interactive platform for public discourse, effectively replacing the limitations of physical spaces and traditional media. This has led to an explosion of diverse voices, perspectives, and opinions being shared globally, thereby revitalizing the public sphere.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The case of the former Soviet Union is often cited as an example that supports Kerr et al.'s (1960) claim. According to this claim, totalitarian regimes are incompatible with the requirements of advanced industrial technology. In the case of the former Soviet Union, it can be argued that the regime was indeed incompatible with the requirements of advanced industrial technology. The Soviet Union's economy was characterized by inefficiencies and lack of innovation, which hindered its ability to keep pace with the technological advancements of Western countries. Therefore, in this case, it can be argued that Kerr et al.'s (1960) claim is supported.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Advanced industrial technology requires a skilled and educated workforce, which leads to increased awareness and dissent, ultimately challenging totalitarian control. This is supported by the case of the former Soviet Union, where the introduction of advanced industrial technology led to increased economic and social changes that ultimately contributed to the collapse of the Soviet regime.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Davis (1995), women may seek cosmetic surgery because they are in pursuit of the 'perfect' body, fuelled by images of beauty. This suggests that women are driven by societal pressures and unrealistic expectations of beauty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Societal beauty standards, often perpetuated by media and male expectations, create pressure on women to conform, leading them to seek cosmetic surgery. This desire is not solely driven by a pursuit of physical perfection but also by the need for self-acceptance and empowerment.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's ideal types of social action are based on the way individuals make decisions and take actions. The four ideal types that Weber identified were instrumental- rational, value-rational, traditional, and affectual. In this case, the correct answer is affectual.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's typology of social action includes actions driven by emotions and immediate gratification, which aligns with the concept of 'effective' action. On the other hand, 'affectual', 'affective', and 'infected' do not fit into this category.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about Becker's proclamation regarding cannabis use. According to the options, Becker proclaimed that cannabis use was 'increasing throughout all sections of youth in the 1970s'. This option seems to be the most accurate and relevant answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Becker's analysis of cannabis use suggests a gradual descent into a deviant lifestyle, implying a dangerous path that young people should avoid. This perspective is consistent with the idea that cannabis use is a learned behavior that can lead to negative consequences.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral panic occurs when there is a perceived threat to social norms, values, and institutions. This perceived threat can be real or imagined, but it must be perceived as a significant threat by the majority of people in society. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'the media exaggerate reports of deviant groups, generating hostile reactions'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral panic arises when media exposure to deviant behaviors, like violence or explicit content, leads to copycat actions among impressionable youth. This phenomenon is often fueled by sensationalized reporting and the desire for attention. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'A': the media exaggerate reports of deviant groups, generating hostile reactions.'",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Allen's study focused on the emotional labour performed by nurses, which is not directly compensated for. This suggests that nurses are expected to perform a significant amount of emotional work without being adequately recognized or rewarded for it.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Allen's study highlights the evolving role of nurses, suggesting a shift in gender demographics with more men entering the profession and challenging stereotypes. This finding has implications for how we understand the concept of 'nursing' and its relationship to societal expectations around gender roles.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. An 'open' society is one that values transparency, freedom of information and expression. In this context, option B seems most relevant. An open society does not have any official secrets in its government, which means that all information is available to the public.",B,"Let's reason step by step. An open society is characterized by equal opportunities and rights for all individuals, regardless of their background or social status. This means that every member has an equal say in decision-making processes and has access to the same resources and opportunities. In this context, option A 'grants every member equal status' is the most accurate description of an open society.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lombroso claimed that criminals were socialized into an 'underworld' of crime, which is option A. This theory suggests that criminal behavior is learned through social interaction and environment, rather than being driven by biological or psychological factors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lombroso's theory suggests that individuals are socialized into criminal subcultures, leading them to adopt deviant behaviors and engage in crime. This theory emphasizes the role of environment and socialization in shaping an individual's behavior and likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Cooley's theory of the looking-glass self emphasizes how our self-concept is based on our perception of how others see us. This means that we tend to adopt the attitudes and opinions of those around us, which shapes our own sense of identity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cooley's looking-glass self describes the process by which young children develop a sense of self as separate from others through social interactions and feedback. The theory emphasizes that children come to see themselves as others do, and this shapes their self-concept. In this case, option C is the most accurate description of Cooley's theory.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The Nation of Islam group appealed to African-Americans who felt excluded from the 'ethnic melting pot' in the USA. This is evident because the Nation of Islam emphasized black pride, self-reliance, and a rejection of white supremacy. These values resonated with many African-Americans who felt marginalized and excluded from mainstream American society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Nation of Islam primarily appealed to young African-Caribbeans living in inner cities, who often formed distinct subcultures and sought identity through the group's message. This demographic is most closely aligned with the Nation of Islam'group appeal.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that children who are still sucking their thumbs when they enter kindergarten are often subject to teasing and ridicule for this behavior. This type of social interaction is an example of informal negative sanction. Informal sanctions refer to the social pressures or disapprovals that individuals may face from others, but which do not involve formal rules or punishments.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Teasing and ridicule, although negative, can be seen as a form of social interaction and attention, which might inadvertently reinforce the thumb-sucking behavior. Therefore, this type of social sanction is an informal positive sanction.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that patterns of drug use in Britain reveal that... This implies that there are specific trends or patterns in British drug use. Given this context, option A seems the most plausible answer. It suggests that drug use has increased and is no longer confined to a hedonistic youth subculture. This aligns with the idea that there are broader patterns of drug use in Britain.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Despite media attention and moral panics surrounding drug use, the actual prevalence of illegal drug use remains relatively low in Britain. Therefore, option D is incorrect. The correct answer must be one of the other options.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A bureaucracy is a type of organization that is characterized by a hierarchical structure, division of labor, and formal rules and procedures. Based on this definition, we can identify which of the options best fits the characteristics of a bureaucracy. In this case, option B, 'The government of a large city', is the most likely answer because it describes an organization with a hierarchical structure, division of labor, and formal rules and procedures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A book club, with its organized structure, assigned roles for discussion leadership, and established rules for participation, exhibits key characteristics of a bureaucracy. Specifically, it has a clear hierarchy (leader, members), division of labor (leadership rotation), and formalized procedures (rules for participation).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that class segregation was apparent in mid-twentieth century Britain. This suggests that there was a clear distinction between different social classes. Based on this, the most likely answer is B: 'working class communities formed in the inner cities, while the middle classes moved out to the suburbs'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Class segregation in mid-twentieth century Britain was evident in the control of public spaces, with upper and middle classes dominating these areas while the working class remained largely confined to their homes. This is reflected in option D: 'the upper and middle classes dominated public space, while working class people were more home-centred'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The demographic transition refers to a significant change in the principal causes of death and disease since industrialization. This transition is characterized by a decline in mortality rates due to improvements in sanitation, healthcare, and living standards. As a result, the population grows at an increasing rate, leading to a relatively young population.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The demographic transition refers to a population decline caused by factors like emigration exceeding immigration, leading to a shrinking population size. This is not the correct answer. The correct answer is B: 'a change in the principal causes of death and disease since industrialization'. This refers to the shift from high mortality rates due to infectious diseases and malnutrition to lower mortality rates due to improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards.'",B
C,Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the argument made by Smith & Tomlinson. They argued that differences in ethnic background were more significant than class or gender in predicting educational achievement. This means that they believed that a student's ethnic background played a greater role in determining their educational success compared to other factors such as class or gender.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Smith & Tomlinson's research suggests that racism within schools creates systemic barriers for ethnic minorities, hindering their educational opportunities and contributing to achievement gaps. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: 'racism in schools undermined the move towards equality of opportunity for children from ethnic minorites'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis claims that early and secure attachment to the primary caregiver (usually the mother) is crucial for a child's healthy development. The thesis suggests that children who are deprived of this early attachment may suffer from physical, intellectual, and social problems in later life. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: 'children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually and socially in later life'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bowlby's maternal deprivation thesis highlights the social construction of 'mothering' and how narratives surrounding motherhood shape expectations and experiences. The thesis suggests that children who are deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother may be prone to suffer physically, intellectually and socially in later life. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: 'children deprived of an early, secure attachment to their mother are prone to suffer physically, intellectually and socially in later life'.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. An ecclesia is a type of religious organization that claims total spiritual authority over its members. This definition suggests that an ecclesia is not just any church, but one that has a specific level of authority and control over its members. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. An ecclesia, like the Catholic Church, has a clear hierarchy of priests, bishops, and cardinals, culminating in the Pope as the ultimate spiritual authority. This is not a sect or cult with a small following, nor is it a church organized around voluntary membership. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: a religious organization that claims total spiritual authority over its members.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The print revolution refers to the significant changes that occurred in the printing industry during the 19th century. This period saw the introduction of new technologies, such as steam-powered presses and rotary printing machines. These innovations enabled mass production of printed materials, making them more widely available and affordable for the general public. As a result, the print revolution had a profound impact on society, enabling greater access to information, education, and entertainment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The print revolution democratized information, leading to newspapers becoming a shared resource owned by the public rather than private entities. This led to mass production and circulation of newspapers, making news more accessible to the general public.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The embourgeoisement thesis suggests that the working class is adopting middle-class values, attitudes, and ways of life. This means that the traditional boundaries between the working class and the middle class are becoming increasingly blurred. In this context, option B seems to be the most accurate representation of the embourgeoisement thesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The embourgeoisement thesis suggests that white-collar jobs are being 'deskilled' as technology simplifies tasks, blurring the lines between social classes. This means that the traditional distinction between working-class and middle-class is becoming less relevant.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'sexual revolution' refers to the significant changes that occurred in sexual attitudes, behaviors, and laws during the 1960s. Among these changes were divorce law reforms, the availability of oral contraception, and a growing recognition of women's sexual pleasure. However, there is no evidence to suggest that a growing fear of HIV and AIDS, fuelled by the New Right, was one of the significant changes that occurred during the 'sexual revolution'. Therefore, option A did not occur during the 'sexual revolution' of the 1960s.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sexual revolution of the 1960s was characterized by a growing recognition of women's sexual pleasure and a shift away from traditional gender roles. Therefore, options B, C, and D are all correct as they reflect changes that occurred during the sexual revolution. Option A is incorrect as it describes a fear that emerged in the 1980s, long after the sexual revolution.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sutherland's study of professional thieves suggests that people are socialized into a life of crime by associating with others who define it in positive terms. This means that the individuals studied did not define themselves as thieves, but rather were influenced by their environment and peers to engage in criminal behavior.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sutherland's study suggests that the majority of crime, particularly theft, is committed by individuals in professional occupations who have access to valuable resources. These individuals often do not define themselves as criminals and may even view their actions as justified or necessary. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Equilibrium theories of social change emphasize that societies tend towards stability and equilibrium, rather than constant change or revolution. This perspective suggests that social change is a gradual process that occurs as a result of the interactions between individuals and groups within society.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Equilibrium theories highlight the role of secularism and mechanization in maintaining social order and stability, as societies adapt to these transformative forces. This perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding how societal structures and institutions respond to and shape these changes.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of disciplinary power refers to the ways in which social norms and expectations are enforced through various means, including punishment, surveillance, and control over resources. In the context of 19th century factories, disciplinary power was exercised through a combination of physical and psychological controls. This included the use of corporal punishment by employers, as well as the exclusion of women from participating in waged labor. However, the most significant exercise of disciplinary power in this context was the control over punctuality, uninterrupted work, and the threat of dismissal. This control was exercised through a combination of physical surveillance, timekeeping systems, and the threat of dismissal for those who failed to comply with these expectations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Disciplinary power in 19th-century factories aimed to make routine tasks less monotonous and improve working conditions for employees. The correct answer is C: punctuality, uninterrupted work and the threat of dismissal.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'positivism' was coined by Auguste Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist. Positivism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes the use of scientific methods to study society and human behavior. It rejects metaphysics and instead focuses on empirical evidence and observation. Therefore, the correct answer is B: the precise, scientific study of observable phenomena.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Comte's term 'positivism' refers to a theory that emphasizes the positive aspects of society and human progress. It is characterized by a focus on scientific method, empirical evidence, and rational inquiry. In this sense, positivism is not about setting out difficult questions or seeking answers through unscientific means.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following is not a problem associated with official statistics on strike action? The options provided are all related to issues with collecting and reporting data on strikes. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'the definition of strikes excludes those that involve fewer than ten workers or last less than one day'. This option stands out as being unrelated to the other options, which all relate to issues with collecting and reporting data on strikes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Official statistics accurately capture all strikes, as any instance where workers stop work, regardless of duration or number, is considered a strike. Therefore, the statement 'most strikes go unnoticed by employers and the mass media' is not accurate because official statistics would still record these strikes.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A sect is a group that breaks away from a larger religious organization or tradition. The question asks what a sect is organized around, and the options provided are beliefs that can be challenged by members, a charismatic leader, and openness to new recruits; tolerance towards other religions and the separation of church and state; voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high levels of emotional commitment; and the idea of the secular world itself as being sacred. Among these options, the one that best fits the definition of a sect is option C: voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high levels of emotional commitment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A sect is typically organized around a charismatic leader who guides the group's beliefs and practices, with members expected to adhere to these principles. In this case, option C best fits this description, as it mentions voluntary membership, democratic leadership, and high levels of emotional commitment.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that it's difficult to ascertain the true extent of domestic violence because of something. This 'something' must be related to the difficulty in ascertaining the true extent of domestic violence. Among the options, only option A makes sense. It suggests that there is a large 'dark figure' of unreported incidents, which would make it difficult to ascertain the true extent of domestic violence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The true extent of domestic violence is hard to determine due to constantly evolving legal definitions of abuse, making it challenging to classify and track incidents consistently. Additionally, many cases go unreported, either because victims are afraid to come forward or because they do not realize that their experiences constitute domestic violence.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'assets' refers to a stock of economic resources, including land, shares and bank deposits. This definition suggests that assets are tangible or intangible resources that have value and can be used to generate income or wealth.",C,Let's reason step by step. The term 'assets' refers to the culturally valued commodities and standards of living that contribute to feelings of relative deprivation among the poor. This definition highlights the social and cultural context in which assets are valued and perceived.,A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Marxist feminists argue that patriarchy is a system of oppression that is rooted in the economic, political and social structures of society. They contend that this system of oppression is maintained through the exploitation of women's domestic labour, which is seen as essential to the functioning of the capitalist economy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: sex classes, through which men oppress women economically, politically and sexually.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Marxist feminists explain patriarchy as stemming from the dual systems of capitalism and male domination, where women's oppression is intertwined with economic exploitation. This perspective highlights how women are often relegated to domestic labour, which is exploited by the capitalist economy, thereby perpetuating patriarchal structures.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to W.E.B. Du Bois, progress for African Americans in the aftermath of slavery depended on their ability to access quality education. This is evident from his statement that 'the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.' Therefore, it can be inferred that according to Du Bois, progress for African Americans required them to have access to quality education.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to W. E. B. Du Bois, progress for African Americans after slavery required them to be trained in practical skills and trades to become self-sufficient members of society. This approach focused on the development of their existing skills rather than requiring them to learn new ones.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mafia is a well-known organized crime syndicate that originated in Italy. It is characterized by its hierarchical structure, code of conduct, and use of violence to achieve its goals. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: organized crime.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mafia, with its focus on illegal financial activities and infiltration of legitimate businesses, is a clear example of white-collar crime. This type of crime involves the use of deception, manipulation, or other forms of dishonesty to achieve financial gain or other benefits.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about a theory that focuses on how society manages to carry out the activities necessary to maintain order and stability. Among the options, functionalism is the most relevant theory. Functionalism views society as a system in which each part works together to maintain social order and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Functionalism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflict theory examines how society maintains order and stability through the management of power struggles and competition between different groups. This theory focuses on how society manages to carry out the activities necessary to maintain order and stability, which is in line with the question's description.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Marx's theory, the 'mode of production' refers to the way in which a society organizes its technical and human resources to produce goods and services. This includes the social relations between people, such as class relationships, as well as the technological and organizational structures used to produce goods and services.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In Marx's theory, the 'mode of production' refers to the average measure of productivity within a capitalist system, reflecting the efficiency of resource utilization. However, this definition is too narrow and does not capture the full meaning of the term. A more accurate definition would be that the mode of production refers to the organization of a society's technical and human resources, including the social relations of production, the division of labor, and the distribution of goods and services.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of the following processes was not identified as a process of decision-making in the USA by Domhoff. After researching, I found that Domhoff did identify the policy-formation process as one of the processes of decision-making in the USA. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the policy-formation process.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Domhoff identified the candidate-selection process as a crucial stage in decision-making within the US political system, alongside other processes like policy formation and ideology. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Domhoff did not identify the candidate-selection process as a process of decision-making.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mosca and Pareto are two prominent sociologists who have made significant contributions to our understanding of social stratification. According to their theories, the ruling elite is a group that exercises power and control over society. This group is characterized by its ability to accumulate wealth, influence decision-making processes, and maintain its position of power. In this context, option A is the most accurate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mosca and Pareto defined the ruling elite as a coalition of social forces possessing specific skills and abilities that enable them to exert influence and maintain their positions. This definition suggests that the ruling elite is not necessarily a minority group, but rather a diverse group of individuals who possess the necessary skills and abilities to exercise power and influence.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Blauner's (1964) study focused on the alienation of workers in various industries. Alienation refers to the feelings of disconnection, powerlessness, and meaninglessness that workers may experience due to their work environment. In this context, Blauner suggested that machine-based factory work was most alienating to its employees. This is because machine-based production often involves repetitive tasks, lack of autonomy, and limited opportunities for skill development or creativity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blauner's research concluded that machine-based factory work, with its repetitive tasks and lack of worker autonomy, is the most alienating form of employment. This aligns with the principles of critical theory, which emphasizes the importance of human dignity and autonomy in the workplace.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Bernstein's idea of 'restricted codes' refers to the use of language that is specific to a particular group or community. This type of language can be difficult for outsiders to understand, and may even serve as a barrier to communication. In this sense, the use of restricted codes can indeed disadvantage pupils at school because it limits their ability to communicate effectively with others.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Restricted codes are likely limited in their vocabulary and complexity, making it difficult for children to communicate effectively outside their immediate peer groups. This could lead to difficulties in expressing themselves, understanding others, and developing social skills.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the reform of the National Health Service in 1990. According to the options, hospitals became self-governing trusts competing for purchasing contracts from health authorities. This means that hospitals were given more autonomy and responsibility for their own finances and services.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When hospitals become self-governing, they have less oversight and are less likely to be held accountable for their efficiency, especially when demand for healthcare is falling. This would lead to a decrease in the inclination of hospitals to run themselves efficiently.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sociologist is conducting research on institutional power relations at a local hospital, which means they are interested in understanding how power is distributed within the hospital and how it affects the daily lives of healthcare professionals and patients. To achieve this goal, the sociologist is using participant observation as their method of data collection. Participant observation involves immersing oneself in the social setting being studied, observing and recording behaviors, interactions, and other relevant phenomena. This approach allows the researcher to gain a deeper understanding of the social dynamics at play within the hospital and how they impact the experiences of healthcare professionals and patients.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sociologist is actively involved in the hospital environment and collecting data, suggesting a controlled experiment is taking place. Participant observation is a research method where the researcher participates in the setting being studied, which aligns with this scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is C: participant observation.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'culture industry', used by members of the Frankfurt School, referred to the way in which cultural products were bought and sold for profit. This refers to the mass production and distribution of cultural goods such as music, film, and literature. In this context, the culture industry is seen as a means of social control, shaping public opinion and influencing individual behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'culture industry' likely refers to how industrialization led to new forms of mass communication, such as radio and television, which transformed how culture is disseminated. This concept is closely related to the idea of the 'mass media', which also emerged during this period.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the work of Smart, which suggests that women's sexual delinquency was more likely to be normalized than men's. This implies that women's criminal behavior tended to reflect traditional gender roles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Smart's research likely suggests that society tends to view women's criminal behavior, especially sexual delinquency, as less serious than men's, leading to a normalization of such behavior. This is in line with the idea that traditional gender roles can influence societal attitudes towards crime and deviance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of 'civil religion' refers to the way that religious values and symbols are used to legitimize and stabilize the social order. On the other hand, 'common religion' refers to the way that people's everyday lives and experiences shape their beliefs and values. In this sense, the shift from 'civil religion' to 'common religion' suggests that people's religious beliefs and practices are becoming more personal and experiential, rather than being solely tied to institutional or traditional forms of religiosity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The shift from 'civil religion' to 'common religion' suggests that while collective worship may have declined, people still maintain their religious beliefs and practices in private. This shift is not about the decline of religion itself, but rather a change in how people express and practice their faiths.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the process by which we acquire a sense of identity and become members of society. This process is closely related to social interaction, learning, and cultural transmission. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'D': Socialization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The process of acquiring identity and becoming a member of society involves adopting standardized norms and values, similar to the principles of McDonaldization. This process is facilitated through social interactions with others, such as family members, friends, and peers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'socialization'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. A population pyramid is a graphical representation of the age distribution of a population. The shape of the pyramid depends on the fertility and mortality rates of the population. If a population has had a slightly larger birth rate than death rate for several generations, it will most likely have a bulging middle section in its population pyramid. This is because the larger number of births compared to deaths will result in a greater proportion of people in their reproductive years (20-49) and a smaller proportion of people in older age groups.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the birth rate has been slightly higher than the death rate for several generations, it indicates an aging population with a larger proportion of older individuals. This would result in a population pyramid that is wider at the bottom than at the top, as there are more older individuals to account for.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stone's research suggests that prior to industrialization, the nuclear family was not a fixed or dominant form of household organization. Instead, extended networks of kin and community were more important. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Prior to industrialization, with communities centered around agricultural practices and extended family networks, the concept of a nuclear family likely did not exist. The idea of a small, isolated family unit is a relatively modern construct that emerged during the Industrial Revolution as people began to move away from rural areas and into cities. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Ferdinand Tönnies developed the concept of gemeinschaft, which refers to a type of social relationship characterized by shared values, norms, and goals. This concept is closely related to the idea of organic solidarity, which was developed by Émile Durkheim. Both concepts describe types of social relationships that are based on shared values, norms, and goals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gemeinschaft, with its emphasis on strong social bonds and shared norms, aligns with the concept of anomie, which describes a lack of social regulation and moral guidance. Both concepts highlight the importance of social relationships and norms in shaping individual behavior.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Secularization is a process of change in which the influence of religion on society decreases. The two related ideas that are central to secularization are disengagement and disenchantment. Disengagement refers to the withdrawal of individuals from religious institutions and practices, while disenchantment refers to the loss of faith or confidence in religious beliefs and values. Therefore, the correct answer is C: disengagement and disenchantment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Secularization likely involves the process of distributing religious ideas across different spheres of society and distilling their essence into secular principles. This would involve disengaging from traditional religious practices and enchantments, as well as disbelieving in supernatural entities and forces.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about an example of a concept, which is not explicitly stated in the options. However, we can infer that it might be related to sociology or anthropology. Among the options, 'An aggregate' seems to fit best as it refers to a group of people who share common characteristics or interests.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The people waiting for the bus are likely a secondary group, as they share a common purpose but lack personal connections and engage in impersonal interactions. In contrast, primary groups typically involve close relationships and shared experiences.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Esping-Andersen's (1990) outline of three types of state welfare models is a well-known framework in social policy analysis. The social democratic model, as described by Esping-Andersen, emphasizes the importance of universalistic benefits and public sector employment. This approach prioritizes social solidarity, equality, and collective provision over individualistic self-reliance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The social democratic model, with its focus on public welfare and social solidarity, likely emphasizes loyalty to the state and adherence to traditional values. This is because social democracy seeks to promote social cohesion and collective well-being through a strong public sector and redistributive policies.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of the labour movement in the nineteenth century, 'incorporation' referred to the process of including workers or their representatives in decision-making processes within industries or companies. This could involve negotiating collective bargaining agreements, participating in joint committees, or serving on company boards. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'including working class organizations in political bargaining and representation'",D,"Let's reason step by step. 'Incorporation' in the labor movement likely refers to the increasing participation of women in full-time paid employment, leading to their integration into the workforce. This is a significant departure from the traditional gender roles and expectations.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 1944 Education Act was a significant milestone in the development of education in England and Wales. According to the act, state elementary education was provided for all children between the ages of five and fifteen. This means that the act did not provide free secondary education for all, as option B suggests.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 1944 Education Act likely aimed to provide public schooling for those who could afford it, ensuring access to education based on financial means. This is evident from the fact that the act did not provide free secondary education for all, which would have been a more comprehensive approach to education.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. The 'new racism' refers to a subtler form of prejudice that is often masked by nationalist pride or other forms of ideology. This concept was first introduced in the 1980s and has since been widely discussed and debated in academic and popular circles.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'new racism' likely represents an anti-fascist movement that challenges nationalist ideologies and promotes inclusivity and diversity. This is evident from the fact that the term 'new racism' is often used to describe a more subtle form of prejudice, masked by nationalist pride.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'hegemony' refers to a dominant ideology that legitimates economic, political and cultural power. This concept was first introduced by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who used it to describe the dominance of Athens over other city-states in Greece.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hegemony likely refers to a state of dual consciousness where individuals navigate between dominant ideologies and their own lived experiences, creating a complex understanding of power dynamics. This concept is often used in Marxist theory to describe the ways in which ruling classes maintain their dominance over subordinate classes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A social stratum is a level in the social hierarchy, comprising people with shared life chances. This definition suggests that a social stratum is not just a methodological tool or a symbol of status, but rather a real and tangible aspect of society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A social stratum likely functions as a symbol of status, such as clothing or material possessions, that distinguishes individuals belonging to different social classes. This definition aligns with the description provided in option D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Marx's statement is referring to the development of the working class through factory-based production. According to Marx, this process would lead to the working class becoming a class in itself, meaning that they would develop a shared identity and consciousness as a distinct social group.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The development of the labor movement through factory-based production would lead the working class to become a 'class in itself', sharing common experiences and conditions. This is because the factory system creates a uniform set of social relations, which in turn shape the consciousness and identity of the workers.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Booth's study in 1901 aimed to investigate the percentage of people living in poverty in London. The study found that approximately 27.50% of people in London were living in poverty. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 27.50%",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the economic disparities and social challenges prevalent in London during the early 1900s, it's reasonable to assume that the percentage of people living in poverty was around 33.20%. This is because Booth's study revealed a significant proportion of people living in poverty, which aligns with this answer.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks why women have been excluded from the public sphere. One possible answer is that industrial capitalism separated the middle class home from the workplace, making it difficult for women to participate in the public sphere. Another possible answer is that those who enter paid employment have been 'sidelined' into particular fields, which may not be suitable for women. Additionally, it could also be argued that it is difficult to succeed in 'malestream' politics without compromising their femininity. Therefore, all of these factors combined make it difficult for women to participate in the public sphere.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Women were historically relegated to domestic roles within the household, while men were the primary breadwinners working outside the home. This gendered division of labor was reinforced by societal norms and expectations, which limited women's opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The general fertility rate fell between 1964 and 2000 because the age at which women marry and have children has increased over time. This is a well-established trend in many developed countries, including the United States. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: increases in the age of marriage and the age at which childbearing begins.",A,Let's reason step by step. Poor living conditions and lack of access to healthcare can lead to higher infant mortality rates and discourage families from having more children. This would result in a lower general fertility rate.,D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The New Right is a political movement that emerged in the late 20th century, characterized by its conservative and traditionalist values. According to the New Right, one of the key indicators of declining family values is the rising divorce rate. Therefore, it can be inferred that the New Right did not suggest the absence of fathers in many households as evidence of declining family values.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of single-parent households and the increasing number of divorces indicate a shift in family dynamics, not necessarily a decline in values. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the New Right did not suggest these trends as evidence of declining family values.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The New Labour government, led by Tony Blair, was in power from 1997 to 2007. During this period, they implemented several education policies. However, setting and streaming pupils by ability, which is option A, was not one of the policies pursued by the New Labour government. This policy was actually introduced by the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.",A,"Let's reason step by step. New Labour, like previous Conservative governments, emphasized academic excellence and believed in grouping students based on their abilities. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would not pursue setting and streaming pupils by ability. The other options are more likely to be policies pursued by the New Labour government.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pluralist theories suggest that there are multiple sources of power within a society, rather than a single dominant source. This means that different groups or individuals may have varying levels of influence over decision-making processes. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: 'the state's power can be exercised through several different administrative structures'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A pluralist system ensures that power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that individuals from various backgrounds can rise to positions of influence. This means that there are multiple administrative structures, ruling elites composed of people from different class backgrounds, and political parties competing for votes. Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of pluralist theories.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of new social movements indicates that people are no longer solely focused on pragmatic issues and concerns, but are instead mobilized by personal, cultural, and environmental issues. This suggests that these issues can indeed mobilize political consciousness just as much as economic interests.",C,"Let's reason step by step. New social movements often address specific issues like environmental protection or animal rights, reflecting a shift towards issue-based politics. This suggests that people are no longer solely focused on economic interests, but are instead motivated by a range of personal, cultural and environmental concerns.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Marx's concept of alienation refers to the ways in which capitalism can estrange individuals from their true human nature, including their fellow humans and society as a whole. In this context, option C is the most accurate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Under capitalism, workers are separated from the means of production, such as factories and machinery, leading to a sense of detachment from their labor. Additionally, workers may also feel disconnected from each other due to the competitive nature of capitalist systems. Furthermore, Marx argued that under capitalism, workers are alienated not only from their labor but also from humanity in general. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The researcher mailed 1,000 questionnaires to members of a labor union and received 300 back. This means that the response rate is only 30%. This low response rate can lead to biased results because those who returned the questionnaires may not be representative of the entire population. Therefore, most likely contaminated by",C,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sample might have included a disproportionate number of dissatisfied union members, leading to an overestimation of overall dissatisfaction in the final results. This is an example of response rate bias.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Parsons' view is that the sick role has a specific function, which is to provide a set of guidelines for medical staff to treat patients in hospital. This means that the sick role provides a framework for understanding and managing illness, rather than simply being a passive state.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sick role allows individuals to make sense of their illness and find meaning in their suffering, contributing to their overall well-being. Parsons believed that this process helps individuals adapt to the demands of illness and maintain social relationships despite physical limitations.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The experimental method is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. It involves isolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another. This allows scientists to control for other variables that might affect the outcome, and to draw conclusions about cause-and-effect relationships. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Scientists are driven by their curiosity and passion for specific topics, which naturally guides their research interests and choices. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: 'isolating and measuring the effect of one variable upon another'. This approach allows scientists to systematically test hypotheses, identify patterns, and draw conclusions about the world around us.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is defined as an area that includes at least one central city with a population of at least 50,000 and it surrounds densely urbanized counties. This definition ensures that the MSA captures the entire metropolitan area, including not only the central city but also its surrounding suburbs and exurbs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Metropolitan areas are often located in coastal regions or areas with specific geographical features that make them susceptible to severe storms. The definition provided in option B seems to be the most accurate, as it describes an MSA as a central city with a population of at least 50,000 and surrounding densely urbanized counties.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a type of political violence that is intended to create fear, panic, and disruption in society. The Chicago School, on the other hand, focuses on explaining crime as a result of social and economic factors, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education. Therefore, terrorism is different from the types of crime described by the Chicago School because it is motivated by political ideology rather than social and economic factors.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism often involves large-scale attacks with complex planning and coordination, distinguishing it from typical street crimes. Additionally, terrorism is often motivated by political or ideological beliefs, which sets it apart from common criminal activity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the common characteristics among religious organizations such as the Church of Norway, Islam, the Church of England, and the Church of Greece. After analyzing each option, we can conclude that the correct answer is D: They are monotheistic. This means that all these religious organizations believe in one God or a single supreme deity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Many traditional religious organizations maintain patriarchal structures that restrict women's participation in leadership roles. This is evident in the fact that many of these organizations have historically excluded women from serving as clergy or holding positions of authority within their institutions.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks when war became possible between nation states in the nineteenth century. This implies that before this time, war was not possible or was limited to certain circumstances. One of the key factors that enabled war to become possible is industrialization. Industrialization provided better transport, technology and administration, which enabled nations to mobilize their resources more effectively and engage in large-scale warfare. Therefore, the correct answer is B: industrialization provided better transport, technology and administration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The competition for resources and control over territories in overseas colonies fueled tensions and conflicts between European powers. This led to a series of wars, including the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the Franco-Prussian War.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Giddens (1998) is a sociologist who defined the concept of 'third way' as an alternative to traditional left-right politics. The 'third way' emphasizes the importance of social justice, equality, and individual freedom. In this context, option B 'putting an end to privatization' does not fit with Giddens' definition of the 'third way'. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. New Labour aimed to foster a stronger sense of community and civic responsibility, promoting active citizen participation in social and political life. This is reflected in the emphasis on 'positive welfare', 'a hand up, not a hand-out', which aims to empower individuals and communities to take control of their own lives and destinies. Therefore, option C: 'positive welfare:  'a hand up, not a hand-out'' is the most accurate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Queer Theory is a critical approach that challenges traditional notions of sexuality, gender, and identity. According to Queer Theory, the categories we use to understand human sexuality are not based on biological differences, but rather on social and cultural norms. Therefore, it's possible for individuals to identify as queer without necessarily identifying with any particular sexual orientation or gender identity. In this sense, Queer Theory challenges traditional notions of sexuality and gender, and instead offers a more nuanced understanding of human sexuality and identity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Queer Theory acknowledges heterosexuality as the dominant and socially accepted sexual orientation. However, it also challenges this notion by arguing that all sexualities are pluralistic, fragmented and frequently reconstructed. This means that individuals may identify with multiple sexual orientations or identities at different times in their lives.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Warner's study of Natchez in the American Deep South showed that the 'colour line' there was a powerful influence upon race relations. The colour line refers to the social and economic segregation of black people from white people. In this context, the colour line is not just a physical boundary but also a psychological and emotional one. Therefore, it is clear that the colour line in Natchez was a powerful influence upon race relations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Over time, social attitudes and legal frameworks have evolved, leading to greater integration and reduced racial segregation in many communities. However, the legacy of historical discrimination and ongoing systemic inequalities continue to shape race relations in many parts of the world.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States government uses a definition of poverty that was established in the 1960s. This definition is based on the concept of absolute poverty, which means that it is not adjusted for inflation or changes in the cost of living. Therefore, the poverty line has been adjusted since its initial establishment to reflect changes in the cost of living and other economic factors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poverty line takes into account individual variations in family size, age, and geographic location to determine the minimum income required for basic needs. This is done through a statistical formula that takes into account these factors. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Structural-Functionalists describe society as a system that is composed of interdependent parts, each with its own function or role to play in the overall functioning of the system. This perspective emphasizes the importance of social institutions and roles in maintaining social order and stability.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Structural-functionalism focuses on societal issues like inequality and power struggles, highlighting conflict as a driving force.

B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hakim (1995, 1996), part-time work is predominantly done by women because their choices are constrained by structural factors, such as being unable to afford childcare. This suggests that the majority of part-time work is not a matter of personal choice or preference, but rather a result of structural constraints and limited options.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Women often end up in part-time work because the full-time jobs they aspire to in specific sectors are simply unavailable. Additionally, women may also be constrained by structural factors such as being unable to afford childcare or other family responsibilities. Therefore, it is likely that women's choices are influenced by a combination of these factors.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the privatization of law and order in the 1980s and 1990s. This can be broken down into three main areas: private security companies, private prisons, and market disciplines to measure police performance. Based on this information, it is clear that all of these options were part of the privatization of law and order during this time period.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The privatization of law and order primarily involved the growth of private security firms taking over traditional policing roles. Additionally, private prisons were built to house inmates. Furthermore, market disciplines were introduced to measure police performance. Therefore, all of the above options are correct.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The policy makers claimed that former slaves migrating to these cities would experience assimilation, which means the process of becoming part of a new culture or society. This is because they were no longer forced to work as slaves and were given the opportunity to start anew in a free society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Policymakers expected former slaves to adapt to the existing social order in cities, adjusting their behaviors and customs. This adaptation was seen as a natural process of assimilation into the dominant culture.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'emotion work' refers to the process of managing and expressing emotions in a socially acceptable way. This concept was first introduced by sociologist Arlie Hochschild in her book 'The Managed Heart'. Therefore, the correct answer is A: the techniques used to consciously manage and present emotions that are deemed appropriate for public settings of interaction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Emotion work refers to situations like grief or falling in love, where individuals expend significant emotional energy. This concept is closely related to Hochschild's (1983) idea of 'feeling rules', which refer to the norms and expectations surrounding how people are supposed to feel in different social contexts.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Warner and Myrdal claimed that black former slaves were not joining the 'ethnic melting pot' of the North American cities because they wanted to retain a strong sense of their original ethnic identity. This is supported by the fact that many African Americans continued to maintain strong ties to their African heritage, even after being brought to America as slaves.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Former slaves primarily remained in the Southern states and couldn't easily relocate to North America due to geographical constraints. Additionally, many former slaves were not prepared to leave their homes and communities behind. Therefore, it is more likely that they chose to remain in the South rather than move to North America.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'secondary deviation' refers to the labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it. This is a key concept in labeling theory, which suggests that deviance is not inherent in an individual or behavior, but rather is created through social processes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Secondary deviation is mainly about the societal response of punishing or stigmatizing individuals for deviant acts. This concept highlights how society labels certain behaviors as deviant, which can lead to social exclusion and stigma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'the labelling of an act as deviant through social reactions to it'.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Pre-testing a questionnaire is an essential step in the survey design process. It allows researchers to identify and fix any issues with the questionnaire, such as unclear or leading questions, before it's administered to the target population. This ensures that the data collected is accurate, reliable, and meaningful.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pre-testing a questionnaire is crucial for ensuring your computer, printer, and other equipment are functioning properly. Additionally, pre-testing helps identify any issues with question wording, routing, or formatting that could impact the accuracy of responses. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: identifying any problems with the question wording and routing.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which idea was not considered in the nineteenth century to explain race in naturalistic terms. Among the options, 'height' and 'brain size' are physical characteristics that were likely considered as part of the naturalistic explanation for race. On the other hand, 'genetics' and 'evolution' are concepts that were not fully developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, it is unlikely that these ideas would have been considered in the nineteenth century to explain race in naturalistic terms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nineteenth-century scientific theories on race focused on social and cultural factors, so evolution wouldn't be a relevant consideration. Genetics was not well understood at that time, but it's unlikely to have been considered as an explanation for race. Height and brain size are physical characteristics that were not typically associated with racial differences in the 19th century.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The social construction of childhood refers to how society shapes our understanding of what it means to be a child. This concept is closely tied to the development of modern childhood as we know it today. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The social construction of childhood primarily arose with the introduction of specialized products like children's clothing, toys, and books. These goods were designed to cater specifically to children's needs and desires, which in turn helped shape societal attitudes towards childhood. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: new consumer goods for children, such as clothes, toys and books.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking why sociologists like Bordo (1993) have attributed the 'epidemic' of anorexia in Western cultures to. From the options provided, we can see that all of them relate to societal and cultural factors. Therefore, it is likely that the correct answer is one of these options. After analyzing each option, I believe that the most plausible explanation is option C: the social construction of mental illness, through which 'normal' patterns of behaviour are pathologized. This explanation suggests that anorexia is not a natural or biological disorder, but rather a socially constructed concept that reflects societal values and norms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rise of anorexia stems from the tendency to label and pathologize certain eating patterns as mental illness, even if they fall within a normal range. This social construction of mental illness can lead to the stigmatization of individuals who exhibit these behaviors, which in turn can contribute to the development of eating disorders such as anorexia.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Wirth (1938) said that social relationships in the urban way of life were 'segmental' because they were characterized by a lack of personal relationships between individuals, but rather by a series of situational roles and interactions. This is in contrast to more traditional or rural societies where people may have stronger personal relationships with one another.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wirth used 'segmental' to describe relationships limited to particular neighborhoods or districts within a city. This suggests that social relationships in urban areas are often confined to specific geographic locations, rather than being more widespread and inclusive.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of market principles to educational policy in the 1980s aimed to increase efficiency, accountability, and parental choice in education. This led to the delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs (Local Education Authorities), which allowed them to make decisions about how to allocate resources within their areas. Therefore, the most accurate answer is B: the delegation of power and budgetary control to LEAs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Introducing market principles in education empowered local education authorities (LEAs) with greater budgetary control and decision-making. This allowed them to make more informed decisions about resource allocation, curriculum development, and personnel management. As a result, LEAs were better equipped to respond to the diverse needs of their students.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The comprehensive school system was introduced in the UK to address social class inequalities in education. However, despite this effort, class inequalities persisted. This is because the comprehensive schools did not fundamentally change the social and economic structures that perpetuated class inequality. Instead, they tended to recruit pupils from the inner cities and traditionally working-class areas, which further entrenched existing social and economic inequalities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Comprehensive schools failed to eliminate class inequalities because of the intense competition fostered by national testing and league tables. This competition led to a 'cream off' effect, where the most able pupils were selected for the top comprehensive schools, leaving the less able pupils in the lower-ranked comprehensives. Additionally, teachers in comprehensive schools used restricted codes of speech, which further exacerbated the class inequalities.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Social norms are the rules, customs, and expectations that govern behavior within a particular group or society. These norms can be explicit, such as laws and regulations, or implicit, such as unwritten rules and social expectations. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D: 'rules and expectations about interaction that regulate social life'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Social norms encompass activities like gardening, cooking, and crafts, which provide individuals with creative outlets. These activities also allow people to express themselves, build relationships, and develop a sense of community. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: creative activities such as gardening, cookery and craftwork.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. 'Eyeballing' is a colloquial term that refers to the act of quickly glancing or scanning something, often without taking precise measurements or calculations. In this context, option A is the most accurate description of 'eyeballing'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eyeballing involves rapidly scanning a document to understand its overall message and key arguments. It is often used in academic, business, or technical settings where one needs to quickly grasp the main ideas and concepts presented in a text.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for examples of a certain type of entity. Walt Disney, Sony and Time Warner are all well-known media conglomerates that own multiple subsidiaries across various industries such as film, television, music, publishing, and more. Therefore, the correct answer is B: multi-media empires.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Companies like Disney, Sony, and Time Warner primarily focus on one specific media type, such as film or television. They also have a significant presence in other related areas, such as music, publishing, or video games. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: multi-media empires.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. World-affirming religions are those that accept and affirm the existing world, its values, and its institutions. They do not reject or seek to overthrow the existing social order. Instead, they offer new means of achieving the goals and values of society. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: 'embrace conventional cultural values but offer new means of achieving them'",A,"Let's reason step by step. World-affirming religions maintain a somewhat critical perspective on prevailing societal values while still acknowledging their importance. They seek to reform or improve these values rather than rejecting them entirely. This approach is reflected in options A and C, which describe the adoption of new means for achieving conventional cultural values and the expression of mild disapproval towards mainstream social values, respectively.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The human relations approach emphasizes the importance of understanding human behavior, emotions, and social interactions within an organization. This approach recognizes that employees are not just machines or cogs in a wheel, but rather complex individuals with their own thoughts, feelings, and motivations. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: teamwork, communication and employee satisfaction.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The human relations approach emphasized offering therapy and counseling services to employees within the work environment. This approach recognizes that employees are not just machines, but individuals with emotional needs and personal issues. By providing these services, organizations can improve employee well-being, job satisfaction, and overall performance.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The mass-society theory suggests that the subordinate classes are dominated by the ideology of the ruling class. This means that the dominant ideology shapes the way people think, feel and behave. In this context, the media can be seen as a tool used by the ruling class to shape public opinion and maintain their power.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mass-society theory suggests that media content is largely determined by market forces and consumer preferences. This means that the media are driven to produce content that appeals to a broad audience, rather than challenging dominant ideologies or promoting social change. In this sense, mass-society theory suggests that the media play a role in reinforcing existing power structures and social norms.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The introduction of a national curriculum in 1988 aimed to address the issue of girls' underachievement in education. However, despite this effort, girls continued to face disadvantages in education because subject choice remained gendered at A level and in higher education. This means that certain subjects like science were still being taught in ways that were more appealing or accessible to boys than to girls. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If girls were receiving less attention from teachers compared to boys, it would naturally hinder their learning and put them at a disadvantage. However, this option is not provided in the choices. Therefore, we need to look for other reasons that might be contributing to the disadvantages faced by girls in education. One possible reason could be that subject choice remains gendered at A level and in higher education. This means that certain subjects are still perceived as being more suitable for boys or girls, which can limit their options and opportunities.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Howard's idea of the garden city was a concept that aimed to create a harmonious balance between urban development and natural environment. The correct answer is A: six small towns surrounded by green belts and linked to a larger central city. This description aligns with Howard's vision of a garden city, where residential areas are separated from industrial and commercial zones, and where green spaces and parks are integrated into the design.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The idea of a garden city surely emphasizes the presence of ample greenery, like trees, flowers, and public gardens, to create a pleasant and healthy environment. Therefore, option B is the most suitable answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The alternative form of 'network organization' refers to a different approach from the traditional hierarchical structure. In this context, option C is the most relevant answer. It describes the Japanese model of network organization, which emphasizes lateral networks of flexible roles and responsibilities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In today's digital age, a network organization would primarily function through electronic communication channels for efficient transactions and collaborations. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Townsend's indicators of relative deprivation were developed to identify areas where people are experiencing poverty and disadvantage. The indicators include factors such as lack of access to basic services, poor housing conditions, and limited social connections. In this context, buying fewer than twenty DVDs in the previous year is not a relevant indicator of relative deprivation. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Relative deprivation is about lacking basic necessities compared to the broader society, so living in a house with structural problems would certainly qualify. Buying fewer than twenty DVDs in a year might be considered a luxury item and not necessarily an indicator of relative deprivation. Similarly, going without a week's holiday in a year might be considered a personal choice rather than an indication of relative deprivation. Therefore, the correct answer is C or D.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'new man' refers to the changing societal expectations of men in the 1980s. Based on the options provided, the most likely answer is A: sensitive, caring, and emotional. This is because the 1980s were marked by a growing awareness of social issues such as gender roles, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. As a result, there was a shift towards more sensitive and caring male role models.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 1980s saw a shift in societal views, and the 'new man' likely embraced a more open and accepting attitude, including being comfortable with bisexuality. This is evident from option D, which explicitly states that the 'new man' was openly bisexual and proud of it.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Industrial production in the nineteenth century was characterized by a significant shift from traditional craft-based industries to machine-based manufacturing. This transformation was driven by technological innovations, such as power-loom weaving and steam-powered machinery, which enabled mass production and increased efficiency. As a result, industrial production became more centralized, with larger factories and workplaces replacing smaller workshops and cottage industries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As industries grew in the nineteenth century, the need for management and organization became crucial, leading to a separation between ownership and control. This is often referred to as the 'managerial revolution'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the increasing interconnectedness of economies, societies, and cultures around the world. Among its many features are an increasing awareness of the world as a whole, the extended power of nation states, the destruction of distance through communications technologies, and the stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries. However, one feature that is not characteristic of globalization is the destruction of traditional industries or ways of life. This option does not accurately describe the phenomenon of globalization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization promotes interconnectedness, so it naturally leads to the stretching of social relations beyond national boundaries as people interact and collaborate across borders. This is a fundamental aspect of globalization. The other options are all features of globalization.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Frank's claim is about 'underdeveloped' societies, which are often characterized by a lack of economic development and integration into the global economy. According to Frank, these societies are not sufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy. This means that they do not have the same level of economic integration as more developed countries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Underdeveloped societies, according to Frank, likely haven't fully integrated into the international capitalist economy and thus remain on the periphery. This is evident from option A, which suggests that underdeveloped societies are insufficiently involved in the international capitalist economy.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A personal document with closed access is typically something that contains sensitive or confidential information about an individual, such as their financial records, medical history, or other personal details. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a confidential medical record.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A shares register contains sensitive information about a company's ownership structure, so it would naturally have closed access to protect confidentiality. In contrast, the other options are not typically considered personal documents with closed access.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'indentured labour' refers to a system where people were brought to a new country and forced to work for a specific employer under poor conditions, often with the promise of being freed after a certain period of time. This system was used in the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly in the British colonies in North America.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Indentured labor in the nineteenth century likely involved the forced transportation and exploitation of people, similar to the practices of the Atlantic slave trade. The term 'indentured labor' is often used interchangeably with 'slavery', as both involve the forced labor of individuals without their consent.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that there was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s because of something. We need to find out what caused this increase in income inequality. Among the options, option C stands out as the most plausible cause. This is because the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings during the 1980s. This means that people's purchasing power decreased, leading to an increase in income inequality.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If income tax rates increased uniformly for all occupational groups, it would disproportionately impact lower-income earners and contribute to income inequality. However, this is not the correct answer because there was a growth in income inequality in the 1980s. Therefore, we need to look at other factors that could have contributed to this increase in income inequality. One possible factor is the rising cost of consumer goods relative to earnings. This could have disproportionately affected lower- and middle-income households, leading to an increase in income inequality. Therefore, the correct answer is C: the price of consumer goods rose at a higher rate than earnings.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Sociology is considered a social science because it studies human social behavior, relationships, institutions, and organizations. The field relies on empirical research methods to collect data, which is then analyzed using various statistical techniques. This approach allows sociologists to develop theories that are supported by evidence, making sociology a social science.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For sociology to be considered a social science, its theories must be logical, clearly defined, and supported by empirical evidence, just like in natural sciences. Additionally, sociologists collect data in a relatively objective and systematic way, which is another characteristic of scientific inquiry. Furthermore, ideas and research findings are scrutinized by other sociologists, which is an essential part of the scientific method. Therefore, sociology can be considered a social science because its theories are logical, explicit and supported by empirical evidence, it collects data in a relatively objective and systematic way, and its ideas and research findings are scrutinized by other sociologists.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'third age' refers to the stage of life after retirement or the end of full-time employment. At this stage, individuals are no longer actively engaged in their careers, but they still have a significant amount of time and energy available for other pursuits. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the 'third age' involves active non-work and independence after retirement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'third age' refers to the period of life after completing education and entering the workforce, where individuals establish their careers and explore youth culture. This stage is characterized by a sense of independence, exploration, and self-discovery. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: active non-work and independence after retirement.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Pilcher (1999) identified soap operas as a 'feminine genre' because they represent images of women as both domesticated and independent. This is evident from the fact that most of the characters in soap operas are women, who are often portrayed as being strong, capable, and independent individuals.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A 'feminine genre' like soap operas would likely alienate female viewers due to its stereotypical portrayals and instead cater to the interests of a male audience.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about environmentalist social movements being global in a certain sense. This implies that we need to consider the scope and reach of these movements. Among the options, option D 'all of the above' seems most plausible because it encompasses all the ways in which environmentalist social movements can be considered global.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Environmentalist movements are global primarily because they raise awareness about environmental risks that affect the entire planet, such as climate change and pollution. Additionally, these movements often appeal to universal values and human rights, which are recognized globally. Furthermore, modern technology has enabled these movements to use global media to generate publicity and mobilize support. Therefore, it is correct to say that environmentalist social movements are global in the sense that they raise awareness about risks that affect the whole planet, appeal to universal values and human rights, and use global media to generate publicity.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'sociology' was coined in the early 1800s, and it is attributed to Auguste Comte, a French philosopher and sociologist. Comte is considered one of the founders of sociology as an academic discipline.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Emile Durkheim, a renowned sociologist known for his work on social facts and suicide, is likely the one who coined the term ""sociology"" in the early 1800s. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: Emile Durkheim.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The media-theses model of media influence claims that audiences selectively interpret what they want to hear. This means that audiences are not passive recipients of information, but rather active participants in the process of constructing meaning from the messages they receive. Therefore, option A is the most accurate representation of the media-theses model.",A,Let's reason step by step. The media-themes model posits that audiences passively absorb the messages presented by the media without actively engaging in selective interpretation or critical thinking. This model suggests that audiences are more likely to be influenced by the media's messages than they would be if they were actively engaged in critical thinking and selective interpretation.,C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Foucault, carceral organizations refer to institutions that have the power to confine individuals against their will. These institutions aim to control and discipline individuals through various means such as physical confinement, surveillance, and punishment. In this context, option C is the most accurate answer because it highlights the way in which carceral organizations strip inmates of their previous identities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carceral organizations, as described by Foucault, likely prioritize human relations and employee satisfaction to create a positive and productive work environment. This is in contrast to the other options, which suggest that carceral organizations prioritize power, control, or surveillance over human relations.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Sociology differs from common sense in that it makes little distinction between the way the world is and the way it ought to be. Common sense often relies on personal experiences, biases, and assumptions, whereas sociology seeks to understand social phenomena through systematic observation, data collection, and analysis. Therefore, option B accurately describes how sociology differs from common sense.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Unlike common sense, sociology doesn't clearly differentiate between the way the world actually is and the way it ideally should be, often leading to subjective interpretations. Sociology also tends to accumulate knowledge from many different research contexts, which can lead to a more nuanced understanding of social phenomena.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following is not recognised as a level of society. The options provided are all levels of society, except for one. That one option is 'the global village'. This term is often used to describe the interconnectedness of people and communities around the world, but it is not typically considered a level of society in the classical sense.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the practice of placing blame on one particular group for the problems of a society. This type of behavior is often referred to as scapegoating. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Scapegoating.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Scapegoating is essentially a form of stereotyping, where negative attributes are assigned to a specific group and they are blamed for societal problems. This phenomenon is often used as a means of distracting attention from the real causes of social issues and to create a sense of division among people. Therefore, scapegoating best describes the practice of placing blame on one particular group for the problems of a society.",C

This concept is crucial in understanding how we develop our sense of self and how we interact with others.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  The 'generalized other' refers to the collection of sociological theories and perspectives that Mead was engaging with and critiquing in his work.  Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Marx predicted that 'class polarization' would occur, which refers to the division of each social class into more or less privileged groups. This means that as society becomes more industrialized and capitalist, the gap between the rich and the poor will grow, resulting in a greater sense of class consciousness among the working class.",B,"Let's reason step by step.  Class polarization, as predicted by Marx, refers to the growth and diversification of middle-class groups, leading to a more complex social hierarchy.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnic identity refers to the way an individual identifies with a particular ethnic group, culture, or community. This sense of belonging is often based on shared experiences, traditions, language, and history. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'a felt sense of group membership on the basis of religion, language, or history'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnic identity is primarily about the labeling and classification of minority groups by those in power, often based on perceived racial differences. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that ethnic identity is also a felt sense of group membership on the basis of shared culture, language, or history.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that the community is changing, with developments being built and upscale shopping centers added. This suggests that the neighborhood is undergoing gentrification, which is a process of urban renewal in which affluent individuals move into previously low-income neighborhoods, leading to an increase in property values and rents. As a result, long-time residents may struggle to afford to continue living in their neighborhood.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  The changes in Leroy's neighborhood suggest a pattern of 'white flight,' where white residents are leaving due to the increasing African American population. However, this is not the case here. Instead, the upscale shopping centers and single-family homes being built suggest that gentrification is occurring. Gentrification refers to the process by which affluent, often white, individuals move into previously low-income neighborhoods, leading to an increase in property values and a shift in the local culture.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which strategy was NOT used by the Conservative government in 1979 to reduce the power of the labour movement. We can eliminate options A, B, and D because they are all strategies that were actually used by the Conservative government in 1979. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Conservative government sought to limit the power of unions by prohibiting strikes that were motivated by political agendas rather than workplace issues. This would have effectively banned strikes that aimed to achieve broader social or economic goals, such as reducing inequality or promoting environmental sustainability. Therefore, option C is not a strategy used by the Conservative government to reduce the power of the labour movement.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Giselle has been in a middle-management position for ten years, and despite her hard work and dedication, she has not been promoted to a higher-level management position. This suggests that there may be some kind of barrier or obstacle preventing her from being promoted. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon is the glass ceiling effect.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Giselle's experience is likely due to 'gender constancy,' where traditional gender roles and expectations limit opportunities for women in the workplace. This phenomenon is often observed in industries with a strong patriarchal culture, such as corporate management.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. The shift from custodial to joint parenthood after divorce means that both parents are expected to co-operate in the continued care of their children. This is a significant change from the traditional model where one parent had total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization.,C,"Let's reason step by step. The shift to joint parenthood means that both parents are obligated to contribute equally to the financial support and material well-being of their children. This does not mean that one parent has total responsibility for the child's welfare and socialization, but rather that both parents share a joint responsibility in this regard.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The tripartite system refers to the educational system in England and Wales from the mid-20th century until the 1970s. During this period, students were streamed into different types of schools based on their academic ability. The three main types of schools were grammar schools for those who passed an exam, technical schools for those who showed a practical aptitude, and secondary modern schools for those who did not pass the exam. In this context, the 11+ exam was used to select pupils for grammar schools that lay outside their catchment area.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The tripartite system categorized schools into three main types: private, public, and comprehensive, each catering to different academic abilities and social backgrounds. Therefore, the correct answer is B: private, public, and comprehensive schools.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Butler & Stokes (1969) suggested that working class support for the Labour Party arose from socialization into working class families and communities. This means that individuals are influenced by their upbringing, family dynamics, and community norms to develop a sense of identity and belonging that is tied to the working class and the Labour Party.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Working-class support for the Labour Party stemmed from shared cultural values and lifestyle preferences that aligned with the party's platform. This is in contrast to rational calculation of self-interest or issue-based concerns about culture and lifestyle, which are more individualistic perspectives.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the deviant subculture of homosexuals in 17th and 18th century London. From historical records, we know that this subculture was known as the 'Mollies'. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Mollies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'dollies' was commonly used to refer to the subculture of homosexual men who gathered in specific areas of London during that period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: mollies.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Parsons argued that the two main functions of the modern family were those that helped individuals adapt to their roles in society. He believed that the family provided a sense of belonging, emotional support, and socialization for its members. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: primary socialization and personality stabilization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Parsons, the modern family serves two essential functions: providing emotional support and fulfilling the need for sexual gratification within a socially acceptable framework. This is evident in the way Parsons describes the family as a 'social institution' that provides emotional support and stability to its members.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Thatcher's government was known for its neoliberal policies, which aimed to reduce the role of the state in the economy and society. The government did strive to achieve marketization and privatization, as well as individual freedom, choice and responsibility. However, it did not aim to provide generous financial benefits for single parents, students and the unemployed, nor did it seek to roll back the welfare state.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Thatcher's government sought to reduce the role of the state in social welfare and promote self-reliance among individuals. This is evident from the fact that they aimed to privatize industries, reduce taxes, and limit the scope of government intervention in economic affairs. Therefore, it can be concluded that Thatcher's government did strive to achieve marketization and privatization, individual freedom, choice and responsibility, but not generous financial benefits for single parents, students and the unemployed, nor the rolling back of the welfare state.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital refers to the social and cultural resources that individuals possess, which can be used to gain access to education, employment, and other opportunities. In this context, the correct answer is C: 'cultural capital'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bourdieu used the term 'cults of the capital' to describe groups within society that are fixated on accumulating wealth and achieving high social status. However, this concept is not directly related to the reproduction of class. Instead, Bourdieu attributed the reproduction of class to the concept of 'cultural capital', which refers to the cultural knowledge, skills, and tastes that individuals acquire through their upbringing, education, and social experiences. This cultural capital can be used to gain access to better educational and job opportunities, thereby perpetuating social inequality.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'nuclear family' refers to a specific type of family structure. It typically consists of two biological parents and their dependent children, living together in the same household. This definition excludes extended family members such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc., who may also be part of the larger family network.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A nuclear family refers to the new family unit created when an individual leaves their original family home and establishes a new one through marriage, marking a fresh start. This definition is in contrast to extended families or other forms of family structures.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Telework is a form of employment that involves working remotely from home or other locations, using information technology such as computers and internet connections. This type of work arrangement allows employees to work flexibly and independently, while still being connected to their employer and colleagues. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'working at home for an outside employer, using information technology'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Telework likely involves jobs like babysitting or other services within a local community network, facilitated through informal channels and word-of-mouth. This is different from running one's own business, working at home for an outside employer, or combining non-manual work with leisure activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: babysitting and other jobs within a local network, through the informal economy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. If an act is 'normalized', it means that the act has become accepted as a normal part of behavior. In this case, option B is the most accurate answer. It suggests that the deviant act is seen as a temporary aberration from an otherwise 'normal' character.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a deviant act becomes normalized, it signifies the initial stage of a deviant career, where the individual progressively engages in more deviant behaviors as the initial act gains acceptance. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Murray's concept of the 'underclass' refers to a group of people who are socially and economically disadvantaged. According to Murray, this group consists of people who are not able to achieve their full potential due to various factors such as lack of education, unemployment, poverty, and social isolation. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Murray's concept of the 'underclass' primarily refers to individuals who are excessively reliant on welfare benefits and government assistance, leading to a culture of dependency. This is not necessarily about intelligence or morality, but rather about the consequences of prolonged reliance on government support.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Technological forms of surveillance have made it easier to access and exchange information about consumers, monitor employees' activities at work, reduce prison overcrowding by the use of electronic tagging, and all of the above. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: 'all of the above'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Technological surveillance tools have mainly made it easier for companies and organizations to access and share private information about consumers, often for marketing or data analysis purposes. Additionally, electronic tagging has been used to reduce prison overcrowding. Furthermore, technological surveillance can also be used to monitor employees' activities at work. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The correspondence principle suggests that there is a relationship between the way people communicate in everyday life and the way they communicate in formal education settings. This principle implies that schools should prepare children for work by teaching them to be obedient, as well as other skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The correspondence principle suggests that children who engage in extensive letter writing tend to develop a stronger grasp of language and communication skills due to the practice and refinement involved in written correspondence. This is consistent with the idea that children's educational achievements are influenced by their home environment, including the types of activities they engage in.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In modern societies, social status is typically measured by a person's position within their social hierarchy. This can be influenced by various factors such as income, occupation, education level, and even age. However, among these options, the most relevant factor that determines social status in modern societies is likely to be income.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In modern societies, social status is primarily determined by a person's verbal fluency and ability to articulate their thoughts and ideas effectively, as communication skills are highly valued in many professional and social settings. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: verbal fluency.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Margaret Mead was an American anthropologist who conducted extensive research on cultural anthropology, particularly in Samoa and New Guinea. In her book 'Coming of Age in Samoa', she argued that the concept of adolescence as a stage of life is culturally relative and varies across societies. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Margaret Mead's research indicates that adolescence in the United States is generally a time of relative stability and tranquility compared to the experiences of adolescents in Japan and Europe, where cultural expectations and societal pressures may create more challenges during this developmental stage. Therefore, option C is the most accurate representation of Mead's findings.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which sociological perspective views society as a system of interdependent and coordinated parts? This description matches the definition of functionalism, which views society as a system in which different parts work together to maintain social order and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Functionalism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sociological perspective that views society as a system of interconnected and coordinated parts aligns with role theory, as it emphasizes how individuals fulfill specific roles that contribute to the overall functioning of the social system. In contrast, functionalism focuses on the ways in which institutions and social structures maintain social order, whereas conflict theory highlights the ways in which social inequality and power struggles shape society. Symbolic interactionism, on the other hand, focuses on the ways in which individuals interact with each other through symbols and language to create meaning and shape their social reality.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Durkheim defined social facts as 'ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are collective and social in origin'. This definition emphasizes that social facts are not individual or personal, but rather they are shared and common to a group or society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Durkheim's definition of social facts pertains to the ways in which scientists construct knowledge and understanding within a social context, influenced by social values, norms, and interactions among researchers. This perspective emphasizes that scientific knowledge is not solely based on objective, empirical evidence, but also shaped by social factors.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of the following is not identified as a new form of community? A, B, and C all refer to specific types of communities that have been formed based on shared identity or experiences. On the other hand, D refers to virtual communities that exist only in cyberspace. Therefore, option D is the correct answer because it does not fit into any of the categories mentioned earlier.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Virtual communities that exist solely in cyberspace cannot be considered true communities as they lack the physical proximity and face-to-face interactions that are essential for genuine community formation. Therefore, option D is not identified as a new form of community.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cultural restructuring refers to the process of transforming cultural landscapes, symbols, and practices to suit new economic, social, or political contexts. The options provided describe different aspects of cultural restructuring. Option C specifically highlights the role of media advertising in shaping cultural narratives and selling sites and images.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cultural restructuring primarily involves the commodification of sites and images through media advertising, where cultural elements are packaged and sold as products in the symbolic economy. This process is often referred to as 'cultural branding'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Post-modernist writers have argued that our understanding of reality is fragmented, and that we can't rely on a single, objective truth. They argue that all theories are equally valid, and that the only thing that matters is how well each theory helps us navigate the complexities of modern life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Postmodernist writers argue that society has undergone significant transformations, necessitating the development of new theories and frameworks to adequately explain and understand these changes. In this context, option C is the most accurate representation of postmodernist thought.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about a sociological concept that describes the process of cultural assimilation, where individuals from different cultures learn and adopt the customs, language, and values of their new culture. In this case, the correct answer is 'Acculturation'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The situation described exemplifies social stratification, as immigrant children entering the United States encounter a hierarchical social system and must navigate their place within it based on factors such as socioeconomic status and cultural background. This is an example of social stratification because it highlights the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and power among different groups in society.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The options provided are triangulation, explanation, description, and exploration. Triangulation is a research purpose that involves collecting data from multiple sources to increase the validity of findings. Explanation is also a research purpose that involves identifying causal relationships between variables. Description is a research purpose that involves providing detailed information about a phenomenon or population. Exploration is a research purpose that involves discovering new knowledge or understanding about a phenomenon or population. The option 'exploration' does not fit into any of the above categories, and therefore it is not a research purpose.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Triangulation is a research purpose that involves using multiple methods or data sources to enhance the validity and reliability of research findings. Explanation, description, and exploration are all important aspects of research, but they are not necessarily 'research purposes'. Therefore, the correct answer is D: exploration.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Totalitarian societies are characterized by a single party or government that exercises total control over all aspects of society, including the economy, education, and media. Therefore, freedom of movement for citizens is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies. Instead, citizens may be restricted in their movements and activities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. One-party rule in a totalitarian society ensures freedom of movement for citizens as there is no opposition or dissent to challenge the ruling party's policies or control over the population. Therefore, option B 'freedom of movement for citizens' is not a characteristic of totalitarian societies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about how national cultures can resist American cultural domination of the media. Sreberny-Mohammadi (1996) argues that one way to do this is by creating 'reverse flows' of their own programmes back to imperial societies. This means that instead of just passively receiving American cultural products, they are actively producing and disseminating their own cultural content.",C,"Let's reason step by step. National cultures can effectively resist American cultural dominance in the media by implementing strict control over the distribution of imported media products, such as banning satellite dishes that provide access to foreign channels. Additionally, national cultures can also create their own 'reverse flows' of programmes back to imperial societies, which would allow them to exert some degree of influence and control over the global flow of information.",D
D,Let's reason step by step. Mulholland (1998) argued that privatization changed the relationship between companies and managers in that it introduced a new form of ownership. This is option C: 'ownership was transferred from small shareholders to senior managers'.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Privatization led to a decrease in flexibility within companies as managers implemented detailed daily worksheets to closely monitor and control employee activities, leaving little room for individual autonomy or deviation from established procedures. This is the opposite of what Mulholland argued, which was that privatization increased flexibility.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. When Berger & Luckmann said that reality is socially constructed, they meant that social interactions and shared meanings shape our understanding of the world around us. This perspective emphasizes that there is no objective truth independent of human perception and interpretation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When Berger and Luckmann stated that reality is socially constructed, they meant that sociologists have the authority to determine what constitutes social reality and then proceed to measure and analyze only those aspects that align with their predetermined definitions. In other words, they are saying that sociologists create their own reality through their research methods and theoretical frameworks.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about someone who has gained a higher (or lower) social position than they were born into. This means that the person has experienced vertical mobility, which refers to changes in an individual's social status or position within society.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Someone who experiences a change in social position, whether higher or lower than their birth position, has experienced absolute poverty, as their economic circumstances have shifted significantly. Therefore, the correct answer is A: absolute poverty.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Freud's notion of the 'ego' refers to the conscious, rational part of the mind that regulates emotional drives on a practical level. This is in contrast to the unconscious, instinctive drives that may be repressed or hidden from conscious awareness.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ego, in Freudian terms, is closely linked to feelings of inadequacy and the desire for belonging, which can lead to neurotic tendencies. Therefore, option D: 'the neurotic part of the mind that longs for belonging and may suffer an inferiority complex'"" is not a correct answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of political culture refers to the way that a society's values, norms, and beliefs shape its political behavior and institutions. This includes the basic beliefs and orientation toward politics that are shared widely by the members of a culture. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Political culture is primarily shaped by the ideological slant of mass media, which influences public perception of political issues. Additionally, cultural products such as novels or paintings can also reflect the political ideologies of their creators. However, these factors are not directly related to the way that people in public offices hold political beliefs and attitudes. Therefore, option B is the most accurate definition of political culture.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy is characterized by several key features, including impersonal rules, hierarchy of officials, and extensive paperwork. Salaries are not explicitly mentioned as a feature of Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'Salaries'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Weber's ideal bureaucracy emphasizes a clear chain of command and hierarchical structure, which necessitates extensive paperwork and record-keeping. Impersonal rules are also an essential aspect of bureaucratic organization. Salaries are not explicitly mentioned in Weber's ideal type of bureaucracy. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'Salaries'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Leisure emerged as a concept in industrial capitalism because it was a result of technological advancements that increased productivity and efficiency. This led to a decrease in working hours, allowing people to have more free time. In this context, leisure meant distinct periods of non-work and relaxation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The emergence of leisure in industrial capitalism is closely tied to the development of public spaces for cultural engagement, such as museums, libraries, and art galleries. These institutions were established to promote civic culture, provide education and entertainment, and foster social cohesion. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'crisis of the 1970s' is a historical periodization that refers to a specific set of social, economic, and cultural changes that occurred during the 1970s. These changes included rising unemployment, declining profits, and a shift in societal values. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 'declining profits and rising unemployment'",A,"Let's reason step by step. The crisis of the 1970s was marked by a decline in traditional family values, leading to increased divorce rates and a shift away from the nuclear family model. This is reflected in option C: 'rising divorce rates and the decline of the traditional family'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Judith Butler's work challenges traditional notions of gender as a fixed biological characteristic. Instead, she argues that gender is performed through cultural norms, social expectations, and bodily gestures. This means that gender is not an essential or innate aspect of human identity, but rather it is constructed and negotiated through social interactions and cultural practices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Judith Butler's work aligns with the historical shift in the eighteenth century where the 'two-sex' model replaced the previously dominant 'one-sex' model of understanding gender. This shift marked a significant departure from the earlier views that emphasized the biological determinants of gender. Instead, the 'two-sex' model recognized that gender is performed through bodily gestures and styles to create 'sex'.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Global tourism can bring many benefits to developing countries, such as increased income, job creation, and cultural exchange. However, it also has its drawbacks, including the exploitation of cheap labor, environmental degradation, and the spread of diseases. Therefore, it is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of global tourism on developing countries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Global tourism provides significant economic advantages for developing countries, as it creates job opportunities and stimulates local economies. However, one potential consequence of global tourism is the exploitation of cheap, unregulated labor in poor countries. This is not a direct consequence of tourism itself, but rather an indirect result of the economic benefits that tourism brings to these countries.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socialization is the process of becoming part of a society by learning its norms and values. This includes learning language, customs, and social skills. It's not just about forming attachments or being part of a group, but rather it's about becoming a functioning member of society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socialization primarily involves the formation of a strong emotional bond between an infant and its primary caregiver, usually the mother. This attachment is crucial for the child's cognitive, social, and emotional development. As the child grows, this attachment gradually evolves into a more complex social relationship with others.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'health transition' refers to the shift from a high mortality rate due to infectious diseases to a high mortality rate due to chronic, degenerative diseases. In stage 3 of this transition, the main causes of illness and death are chronic, degenerative diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and strokes. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In stage 3 of the health transition, the primary causes of death and illness are acute infectious diseases such as typhus, measles, and cholera, which were prevalent in earlier stages. However, with advancements in medicine, sanitation, and public health infrastructure, these diseases have largely been controlled or eliminated in many parts of the world. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the main causes of illness and death in stage 3 are chronic degenerative diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and strokes.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow's theory of gender socialization suggests that children learn gender roles through interactions with caregivers. According to this theory, both boys and girls are initially closely attached to their mothers, but then they begin to differentiate themselves from one another. This differentiation is thought to be influenced by the different ways in which boys and girls are treated by their caregivers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Chodorow's theory emphasizes the process of girls developing their gender identity through a close attachment to their mothers, followed by a subsequent separation and individuation. This process is thought to be crucial for girls' development of a sense of self and their ability to form healthy relationships with others.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The functionalist theory of inequality suggests that high rewards and incentives ensure that the most skilled individuals will take the most important social positions. This means that individuals are rewarded based on their merit, skills, and abilities. In this sense, the functionalist theory of inequality suggests that inequality is a natural consequence of individual differences in skills, abilities, and achievements.",A,Let's reason step by step. Functionalist theory posits that inequality serves no purpose in society and should therefore be eradicated to create a more equitable social order. This perspective suggests that the current system of inequality is dysfunctional and needs to be replaced with a more just and equal system.,C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnographic research is a qualitative research method that involves studying the culture and behavior of a particular group or community. The data collected through ethnographic research is typically in the form of field notes, interviews, and observations. This type of data is not amenable to statistical analysis, but rather requires a more nuanced and interpretive approach. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethnographic research relies on qualitative data due to its comparative nature, drawing insights from analyzing data across various cases and contexts. This approach is inherently non-numerical, focusing on rich descriptions, narratives, and contextualized meanings rather than statistical analysis or quantifiable data.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that marriage appears to be in decline because of something. We need to identify what that something is. Option A talks about a decrease in people living alone, which doesn't seem relevant to the decline of marriage. Option B mentions cohabiting relationships, but it's not clear how this would lead to a decline in marriage. Option C talks about remarriages compensating for the drop in first marriages, which seems like a plausible explanation for the decline of marriage. Therefore, the correct answer is D: all of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Despite the decline in first marriages, the overall marriage rate remains relatively stable due to the increasing trend of remarriages among divorced individuals. This means that while there may be fewer people getting married for the first time, there are more people getting married for the second or third time. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the view of anti-psychiatrists like Scheff. According to Scheff, mental illness is not a medical condition, but rather a social construct that arises from the interactions and relationships within society. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 'a form of deviance, occurring when people challenged taken for granted expectations about interaction'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anti-psychiatrists like Scheff argued that mental illness is primarily shaped by the dynamics of interactions within families and communities, leading to the labeling and stigmatization of individuals. This perspective emphasizes the importance of social context in shaping our understanding of mental health.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario describes a major car accident, and people stopping to help others. This phenomenon can be explained by the Contagion theory. According to this theory, when one person exhibits a certain behavior, it triggers a similar response in others. In this case, the initial helper's actions triggered a chain reaction of helping behaviors among others.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The scenario is best explained by convergence theory, as it suggests that individuals with similar characteristics and tendencies are more likely to converge in the same situation and act similarly. In this case, the man who stopped his car and started helping others was likely influenced by a desire to help others, which is a common human tendency. As he saw others stopping and helping, he was likely motivated to do the same, as it is often easier to conform to social norms than to stand out from the crowd.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about consistency with current research in the area of gender roles and the workplace. The correct answer is D, which states that most men married to working women do not share housework and childcare obligations equally with their working wives. This statement aligns with current research on gender roles and the workplace, which suggests that despite progress towards greater equality, many men still do not share household responsibilities equally with their female partners.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Research suggests that most men still hold traditional views on gender roles, believing that women should prioritize homemaking while men focus on their careers due to their higher earning potential. However, this view is not supported by current research in the area of gender roles and the workplace. In fact, many studies have shown that there are no significant differences between men's and women's abilities or performance in most jobs, including those traditionally considered 'male' or 'female'. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the statement 'Most men believe that women should be homemakers because men earn more money.' is not consistent with current research conducted in the area of gender roles and the workplace.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A survey should aim to gather accurate and reliable information from respondents. Asking leading questions can influence the responses of participants, which may not accurately reflect their opinions or behaviors. Therefore, a survey should avoid asking leading questions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure open-ended responses and gather more nuanced data, surveys should avoid using fixed-choice questions that limit participants' options. Instead, the survey should use open-ended or scaled questions to allow respondents to provide more detailed and thoughtful answers.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Herberg's study, published in 1955, aimed to understand the role of religion in American society. The study found that ethnic minorities practised religion to achieve social acceptance in the culture. This suggests that religion played a significant role in helping minority groups integrate into mainstream American society.",A,Let's reason step by step. Herberg's study indicated that ethnic minorities in America primarily practice religion as a means to assimilate into the dominant culture and gain social acceptance. This suggests that option A is the most accurate answer.,A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'Great Migration' of 1916-1919 was a significant event in American history, during which millions of African Americans left their rural homes in the South to seek better economic opportunities and social justice in urban centers like Chicago. This mass migration had a profound impact on the demographics, economy, and culture of cities like Chicago, leading to increased diversity, cultural exchange, and social change.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'Great Migration' led to the assimilation of diverse ethnic groups in Chicago, creating an 'ethnic melting pot' where racial boundaries dissolved and a unified cultural identity emerged. This process was facilitated by the social and economic mobility offered by urban life, which allowed individuals from different backgrounds to interact and integrate with one another.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The market model of state welfare is based on the principle that individuals should buy welfare privately, with some means-tested benefits. This approach assumes that individuals are responsible for their own well-being and that the state should only provide a safety net to those who cannot afford it. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The market model of state welfare is based on the principle of providing benefits primarily to men as the traditional earners of the 'family wage', ensuring family stability and economic support. This approach emphasizes the importance of male breadwinners in society, which was a dominant social norm during the early 20th century.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. White-collar crime is often referred to as 'low-visibility crime' because it typically involves non-violent crimes that are committed for financial gain or personal advantage. The fact that these crimes are not violent does not mean they are any less serious or harmful. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: the police turn a blind eye to corporate crime.",C,"Let's reason step by step. White-collar crimes, like petty theft or small-scale fraud, typically involve small amounts of money, making them less noticeable compared to large-scale financial crimes. Therefore, the correct answer is A: it involves only small amounts of money.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sociologists study the structure of layers in society and people's movement between them to understand social stratification, which refers to the way societies rank their members based on factors such as wealth, income, education, occupation, race, ethnicity, gender, age, and religion.",A,Let's reason step by step. Studying the structure of layers in society and people's movement between them is about understanding how different social groups work together and contribute to overall social solidarity. This concept is known as social stratification.,A
B,Let's reason step by step. The Macpherson Report highlighted the increasing problem of hate crimes: violence against ethnic minorities simply because of their race. This is a serious issue that requires immediate attention and action.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The Macpherson Report primarily focused on the rising issue of hate crimes, where individuals from ethnic minorities are targeted due to their race or ethnicity. This report highlighted the need for urgent action to address this growing problem.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socialization is the process of learning social skills and norms through interactions with others. In early childhood, the most important agent of socialization is the family. The family provides a child's first and most significant social environment, where they learn essential social skills such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the family is the most important agent of socialization in early childhood.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In early childhood, children are heavily exposed to mass media like television and the internet, which play a crucial role in shaping their values, beliefs, and behaviors. However, research suggests that the most important agent of socialization in early childhood is actually the family. The family provides a child with a sense of belonging, identity, and security, which are essential for healthy development. Therefore, it can be concluded that the family is the most important agent of socialization in early childhood.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In the 19th century, homosexuality was viewed as a taboo and a threat to societal norms. It was seen as an unnatural behavior that went against the traditional gender roles of men and women. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the nineteenth century, homosexuality was considered a strict taboo, resulting in the complete isolation of homosexual individuals from mainstream society due to societal disapproval and fear. This understanding is reflected in option B: 'an absolute taboo, which meant that all homosexuals were isolated'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'absolute' poverty line refers to a specific level of income or resources that is considered necessary for basic human needs, such as food, shelter, and clothing. This concept is often used in international development and humanitarian contexts to identify the most vulnerable populations and target interventions accordingly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute poverty line is used to identify households that are considered poor in relation to the prevailing cultural norms and values of their society. This means that it's not just about the level of income, but also about how that income compares to what others in the same community have. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'the estimated minimum level of income needed for subsistence'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about a theory of development that suggests societies move from traditional to modern, industrial forms of organization. This type of development is often referred to as modernization. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Modernization theory.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The theory suggesting that societies progress from traditional to modern, industrial forms is known as Westernization theory, emphasizing the influence of Western culture on development. However, this theory has been criticized for its Eurocentric perspective and neglect of non-Western experiences. Therefore, a more comprehensive theory that acknowledges the diversity of human experience is needed.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Scott (1990), a document is 'authentic' if it meets certain criteria. The correct answer is C: 'has both a literal and an interpretable meaning'. This definition of authenticity emphasizes the importance of understanding the document's meaning, not just its physical existence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Scott (1990), an authentic document possesses both a clear literal meaning and a deeper, interpretable meaning that requires analysis and understanding. This definition suggests that authenticity is not solely dependent on the physical characteristics of the document or its authorship, but rather on the depth and richness of its meaning.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The managerial revolution refers to a shift in the way businesses are run, from owner-managed enterprises to professionally managed organizations. John Scott argues that during this period, ownership and management became increasingly separate functions. This means that owners no longer directly controlled the day-to-day operations of their businesses, but instead relied on professional managers to do so.",B,"Let's reason step by step. John Scott (1997) argued that the 'managerial revolution' led to a clear separation between ownership and management, with managers becoming the dominant force in controlling businesses. This is evident from option B:  'ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions'.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The study by Brown & Harris (1978) focused on the relationship between social support and women's susceptibility to stress. They found that women with low levels of social support were more likely to experience depression. This suggests that social support plays a crucial role in protecting against depression, particularly for women.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Brown & Harris (1978) found that men and women exhibit relatively similar levels of diagnosed depression, indicating that gender does not play a significant role in depression rates. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: men and women have fairly similar levels of diagnosed depression.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Economic aid has largely failed to promote modernization in developing countries because it often comes with conditions that hinder economic growth and development. For instance, debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received, which can lead to a vicious cycle of debt. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Economic aid has failed to effectively promote modernization in developing countries because the United Nations has not actively urged rich countries to provide financial assistance. Additionally, debt repayments with interest can be greater than the amount of money received, making it difficult for developing countries to make progress towards modernization.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Role-learning theory suggests that we internalise and take on social roles from a pre-existing framework. This means that our understanding of ourselves and others is shaped by the social roles we adopt. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Role-learning theory suggests that we actively construct and negotiate our social roles through interactions with others, rather than simply internalizing pre-existing roles. This means that social roles are not fixed or stable but fluid and pluralistic.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'world system' refers to a global network of interconnected societies, economies, and cultures. This concept was first introduced by Immanuel Wallerstein in his book 'The Modern World-System'. According to Wallerstein, the world system is characterized by a division of labor that extends across different regions and societies. This division of labor creates economic and social inequalities between different groups within the world system.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wallerstein's term 'world system' refers to an empire that lacks a central political center but maintains a bureaucratic administration to manage its vast territory and diverse population. This is evident in the description provided, which highlights the division of labor across ethnic and cultural groups.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'feminist standpoint' suggests a perspective that is grounded in feminist theory and praxis. This perspective recognizes the ways in which women's experiences, voices, and knowledges have been marginalized, silenced, or erased throughout history. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: studying society from the perspective of women.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'feminist standpoint' emphasizes the importance of recognizing the differences and diversity in women's lives, acknowledging that women's experiences are not monolithic. This perspective encourages us to consider how gender shapes our understanding of the world and ourselves.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Social institutions are the building blocks of society, and they play a crucial role in shaping our social reality. In contemporary societies, social institutions are highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices that serve specific functions and purposes. For example, education is an institution that provides knowledge, skills, and values to individuals, while healthcare is an institution that provides medical care, treatment, and prevention services to individuals and communities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In contemporary societies, social institutions have evolved into virtual communities within cyberspace, where individuals interact and form social connections online. This has led to the development of highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices that are unique to these virtual communities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 'highly specialized, interrelated sets of social practices'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'feminization of poverty' refers to the phenomenon where women are disproportionately represented among those living in poverty. This is often due to factors such as gender-based discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited social support networks. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'women's increased chances of being in poverty, due to low pay and greater welfare dependency'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'feminization of poverty' refers to the disproportionate number of female sociologists who dedicate their research to studying and understanding poverty. This phenomenon is often attributed to the fact that women are more likely to be affected by poverty due to systemic gender-based discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and other social and economic factors.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about one of the difficulties in 'operationalizing' concepts like social class. This means that we need to define and measure social class in a way that is reliable, valid, and applicable to real-world situations. However, this can be challenging because social class is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be difficult to define and measure accurately. Additionally, different researchers and theorists may have different definitions and conceptualizations of social class, which can make it even more challenging to operationalize the concept.",B,Let's reason step by step. One of the challenges in 'operationalizing' concepts like social class is the absence of reliable indicators to measure and quantify such abstract ideas. This makes it difficult to compare and contrast different groups or populations based on their social class.,B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The new highway extends from a major city through an area used for farmland. This suggests that the highway is intended to improve connectivity between the city and the surrounding areas, including the farmland region. As a result, it is most likely that people from the countryside will move to the city, depopulating the farmland region.",D,"Let's reason step by step. With a new highway connecting the city to farmland, people from the countryside are likely to migrate to the city for better opportunities, leading to a decline in the rural population and farmland abandonment. This is a classic example of suburbanization.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of post-industrial society was first introduced by Daniel Bell in his book 'The Coming of Post-Industrial Society' published in 1973. According to Bell, a post-industrial society is characterized by the shift from an industrial economy based on manufacturing and production to a service-based economy focused on knowledge, information, and services. In this context, option C: 'a shift towards a service economy, based on knowledge and information' is the most accurate description of the post-industrial society identified by Bell.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 'post-industrial society' described by Bell (1973) is marked by the increasing power of trade unions in mediating and resolving industrial disputes between workers and employers. This shift away from industrial production and manufacturing towards a service economy, based on knowledge and information, is also characteristic of this post-industrial society.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The ecological approach to urban sociology is concerned with understanding how human societies interact with their natural environments in urban settings. In this context, studying 'how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources' would be a relevant aspect of this approach.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The ecological approach to urban sociology involves studying how people organize and participate in collective protests and movements to address environmental issues within the city. This approach recognizes that cities are complex systems where social, economic, and environmental factors interact and influence one another.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 'decentralized city' refers to a city where employment, services and population are distributed across multiple centres in smaller towns and rural areas, rather than being concentrated in one central location. This can be identified by the shift of employment and services away from the inner city towards these multiple centres.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Decentralization implies a move away from centralized structures, including those that might reinforce gender inequalities in public spaces. The shift towards multiple centers in smaller towns and rural areas is more likely to promote decentralization than the other options. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Berger's metaphor for social reality is a way to describe how society functions and how individuals interact with each other within that system. The metaphor suggests that people are like puppets on strings, controlled by external forces such as societal norms, expectations, and institutions. This metaphor highlights the idea that our choices and actions are influenced by factors beyond our control, and that we may not always be aware of these influences.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Social reality is often unpredictable and full of unexpected turns, much like a fairground ride with its various twists and turns. This metaphor highlights the dynamic and ever-changing nature of social reality.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the type of family unit that Robert, Tanya, and their three children form. Since they are a married couple with their biological children, this falls under the category of a nuclear family.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A communal family typically involves multiple individuals or families living together and sharing resources, which aligns with the description of Robert, Tanya, and their children. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a communal family.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Over-urbanization refers to a situation where the rapid growth of cities leads to a range of social, economic and environmental problems. This can include issues such as poverty, unemployment, inadequate housing, poor sanitation, lack of access to healthcare, education and other basic services. In this context, over-urbanization means that the rapid growth of cities is leading to these kinds of problems.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'over-urbanization' suggests an excessive focus on urban development, potentially overshadowing other crucial aspects of development in poorer countries. This implies that resources are being drained from rural areas to support the rapid growth of cities, leading to a range of negative consequences for local communities and the environment.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Differential association theory proposes that people learn criminal behavior through interactions with others who engage in similar behavior. The theory suggests that an individual's likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior is influenced by the number and frequency of interactions they have with others who engage in criminal behavior. In this context, statement A 'If all of your friends jumped off a bridge, I suppose you would too' can be seen as an example of differential association theory. The statement suggests that if one's friends engage in a particular behavior (in this case, jumping off a bridge), then the individual is more likely to engage in that behavior as well.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Differential association theory emphasizes learning behaviors from those around us, which can involve exploring different options and approaches, just like trying the window if the door is closed. This theory suggests that our behavior is shaped by the people we associate with, rather than being solely determined by internal factors.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Parker's extension pattern refers to a phenomenon where people extend their leisure time into work hours, or vice versa. This can be seen in various professions, such as professionals and skilled workers who see their work interests spilling over into leisure time. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: characteristic of professionals and skilled workers, whose work interests spilled over into leisure time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'extension pattern' suggests a balanced approach to work and leisure, where individuals maintain a clear separation between the two without letting one dominate the other. This is evident in semi-skilled manual and clerical workers who have a neutral balance between work and leisure as neither connected nor oppositional.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks how the capitalist class of the mid-twentieth century joined the upper class. The correct answer is C: 'owned companies and financial assets that generated wealth through corporations'. This is because the capitalist class of the mid-twentieth century were primarily defined by their ownership and control of large corporations, which generated wealth through profits.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Joining the upper class often involves participating in exclusive social events and activities, which allows individuals to network and establish connections with other members of the elite. This is what option A suggests, as it mentions 'participated in the same leisure pursuits and events of the 'social calendar''.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Scott (1991) introduced the term 'power elite' to describe a group of individuals who hold significant social, economic, and political power. The correct answer is D: a state elite whose members are drawn overwhelmingly from a power bloc. This definition aligns with Scott's concept of the power elite.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'power elite' refers to a small group of individuals who hold significant economic and political power, similar to the ruling class or bourgeoisie in Marxist theory. In this context, Scott's concept of the 'power elite' suggests that these individuals are not just wealthy or influential, but also have a shared interest in maintaining their power and privilege.",D
