D,"Let's reason step by step. The wound is described as a 7-cm, pink, soft, granular, edematous wound. This suggests that the wound is in an early stage of healing, characterized by inflammation and tissue repair. Increased activity of glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) would be consistent with this scenario.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The wound is described as pink, soft, granular, and edematous, which are all typical characteristics of acute inflammation. We know that P-selectin plays a key role in acute inflammation by mediating the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. Therefore, it is most likely that P-selectin is involved in the formation of this tissue.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). These symptoms are likely related to an imbalance in neurotransmitters. Given the patient's symptoms, it is most likely that pharmacotherapy should be targeted towards serotonin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is associated with dysfunction of the glutamate system. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter involved in various cognitive functions, including memory and attention, and its dysregulation can lead to obsessive-compulsive behaviors. Therefore, pharmacotherapy should be targeted to glutamate.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in the pulmonary arteries. This blockage can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this case, the most specific indicator of pulmonary arterial hypertension would be the presence of an S3 gallop rhythm on physical examination.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's peripheral edema is most likely due to the pulmonary embolism, which can cause increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation and lead to fluid retention. This fluid retention can manifest as peripheral edema. Therefore, the presence of peripheral edema does not specifically indicate pulmonary arterial hypertension.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation with an increased MSAFP concentration (3 multiples of the median). This suggests that there may be a risk of open neural tube defects or other chromosomal abnormalities. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform amniocentesis for measurement of \u03b1-fetoprotein concentration and to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid for further testing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The triple screening is used to assess the risk of fetal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, trisomy 18, and neural tube defects. Since the MSAFP is elevated, the next step is to perform the triple screening to further evaluate the risk of these abnormalities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Triple screening for MSAFP, serum \u03b2-hCG, and serum estriol concentrations.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of smoking and heavy lifting, which are risk factors for developing lumbar disc herniation. The patient's symptoms, including low back pain that radiates down his right leg, are consistent with a lumbar disc herniation. The straight-leg raise test was positive on the right, indicating nerve root compression in the lower lumbar spine. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is displacement of the nucleus pulposus.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a herniated disc, which can cause pain that radiates down the leg. Hypertrophy of the facet joints is a common cause of low back pain, but it does not usually cause pain that radiates down the leg. Osteophyte formation and spondylolisthesis are less likely causes of this patient' s symptoms.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 32-year-old woman who has been admitted to the hospital in active labor. She has a history of mild asthma treated with inhaled bronchodilators. During the second stage of labor, she develops a prolonged deceleration on the fetal heart rate monitor, followed by acute onset of shortness of breath, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness. This is a classic presentation of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, causing a systemic inflammatory response. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness, are consistent with a myocardial infarction. The rapid onset of these symptoms suggests a sudden and severe cardiac event. Additionally, the presence of bleeding from the nose, mouth, and intravenous sites is also consistent with a severe cardiovascular event.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing numbness in his hands and feet, weakness in his legs when he stands, and areflexia. These symptoms suggest a peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by various factors such as chemotherapy, vitamin deficiencies, or autoimmune disorders. Given that the patient has received three courses of chemotherapy, it is likely that the chemotherapy is causing the peripheral neuropathy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug that can cause various side effects, including neuropathy. The patient's symptoms of numbness and weakness are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by methotrexate. Therefore, the most likely cause of these adverse effects is methotrexate.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of severe allergic reactions to bee stings, with each reaction becoming more severe over time. Given this history, it is likely that the patient will experience another severe allergic reaction if they are stung again. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition is to carry self-injectable epinephrine.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help alleviate allergy symptoms such as hives and itching. While it may be helpful in reducing the severity of future reactions, it is not sufficient to prevent anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, carrying self-injectable epinephrine is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a perforated appendix, which is a surgical emergency. In this case, the most likely organism to be present in the peritoneal fluid is Escherichia coli (E. coli), as it is a common cause of appendicitis and peritonitis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Candida albicans is a common cause of infections in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever are consistent with a bacterial infection, such as appendicitis, which is more likely to be caused by Escherichia coli. Therefore, the most likely organism that will be found in the peritoneal fluid is E. coli.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing dizziness, which could be related to her hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, it would be reasonable to adjust her medication regimen to better manage her blood pressure and glucose levels. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate next step in management.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cardiac stress scintigraphy is a test used to evaluate heart function and identify potential causes of dizziness. However, in this case, the patient's dizziness is more likely due to orthostatic hypotension, which is a drop in blood pressure when standing up. Therefore, adjusting her medication regimen or considering warfarin therapy are not the most appropriate next steps. Transesophageal echocardiography may be useful in evaluating cardiac structure and function, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Based on these symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that the patient has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, cysts on the ovaries, and insulin resistance. The ovarian mass detected by ultrasonography is consistent with the presence of multiple cysts on the ovaries, which is a common feature of PCOS. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ovarian carcinoid is a rare type of tumor that can produce hormones, including testosterone, leading to virilization. The patient's symptoms of increased facial hair growth, temporal balding, and clitoral enlargement are consistent with virilization, which can be caused by an ovarian tumor. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an ovarian carcinoid.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is refusing insulin injections, which will lead to further complications and potentially even death. However, the patient has expressed a clear desire to refuse treatment and accept the consequences of her decision. In this case, it would be appropriate to respect the patient's autonomy and allow her to make an informed decision about her own care.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's refusal of treatment could be interpreted as a sign of depression or other mental health issues. However, there is no evidence of depression or other mental health problems in this case. The patient's decision appears to be based on her understanding of her medical condition and her personal values. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to offer insulin but allow the patient to refuse it.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 34-year-old white woman who presents with a persistent dull headache, stiff neck, and difficulty sleeping for the past 3 days. She also reports electric shock sensations when her neck is flexed forward. These symptoms are consistent with meningitis or encephalitis, which require immediate further evaluation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's abdominal striae could be a sign of Cushing's syndrome, which can cause similar symptoms like headache and hypertension. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are more likely due to a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. The most indicative physical finding for this condition would be neck stiffness with painful flexion.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is awake but not completely alert, which suggests that she may be experiencing some level of sedation or altered mental status. Given her history of substance use disorder and her current use of morphine, it's possible that she may be at risk for developing an opioid use disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action by the physician is to reassess the patient's pain management plan and consider alternative analgesic options that may have a lower potential for abuse or addiction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse the effects of opioids. While it may be helpful in preventing overdose, it is not a suitable treatment for preventing addiction. In this case, the patient's risk of addiction is low, and reassurance from the physician is the most appropriate initial action. Additionally, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of addiction or other complications.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's behavior is characterized by berating the nurses and other staff, while being polite to the physician. This suggests that the patient may be using a defense mechanism to cope with his feelings of anger or frustration towards others. Furthermore, the patient's statement about his missing child being worthless suggests that he may have unresolved issues related to his family dynamics. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior is projective identification.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Projective identification is a defense mechanism in which a person projects their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings onto another person. In this case, the patient is projecting his negative feelings onto his missing child, who he sees as worthless. However, the patient's behavior is more likely due to splitting, a defense mechanism in which a person sees others in extreme, all-or-nothing terms. The patient is splitting himself into two groups: those who are worthy (his wife and two adult children) and those who are worthless (his missing child).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath, which are symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Given the patient's history of cocaine use, it is likely that his symptoms are related to a cocaine-induced cardiac event. In this case, the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time would be...",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce blood pressure and heart rate. However, in this case, the patient's chest pain and shortness of breath are most likely due to cocaine-induced myocardial ischemia, which is not effectively treated with beta-blockers. Phentolamine is a vasodilator that can help reduce blood pressure and improve blood flow to the heart, making it the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that may exacerbate the patient' s symptoms.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 52-year-old female who presents with greenish discharge from her left nipple. There is no history of trauma or fever, and the patient is not currently using oral contraceptives nor is she on hormone replacement therapy. Her last pregnancy was approximately 20 years ago. Given these facts, it is most likely that the patient has mammary duct ectasia, which is a benign condition characterized by dilation and ectasia of the milk ducts. This condition can cause nipple discharge, which in this case is greenish in color.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Breast cancer can sometimes cause nipple discharge, but it is more likely to be a bloody or clear discharge. The patient's greenish discharge is more consistent with mammary duct ectasia, a condition where the milk ducts become dilated and inflamed. This condition is often associated with nipple discharge, which may be yellowish or greenish in color.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient received radiation therapy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, but the tumor progressively increased in size and eventually led to the patient's death. This suggests that the radiation therapy was not effective in controlling the growth of the tumor. Furthermore, the presence of a point mutation in the p53 gene (TP53) suggests that there may be a defect in cell cycle arrest. Given these findings, it is most likely that the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy is related to a defect in cell cycle arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. P53 is a checkpoint protein that ensures the cell is ready to divide. It plays a key role in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, where it checks for DNA damage and halts the cell cycle if necessary. However, p53 is also involved in the G1 phase, where it controls the entry of cells into the cell cycle. In this case, the progressive tumor growth despite irradiation therapy suggests that the tumor cells have developed a mechanism to bypass or evade the normal mechanisms of cell cycle regulation, including the function of p53. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: M.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has frostbite of both feet, which is a serious condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's symptoms include blackening of all the toes on the right foot, febrile illness, and progressive confusion. Given these symptoms, it is likely that the patient has developed gangrene, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate surgical intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient would be amputation of the affected limb to prevent further spread of the infection and to improve the patient's chances of survival.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Topical collagenase is used to treat certain types of wounds, but it is not appropriate for treating frostbite. In this case, amputation is the most appropriate treatment to prevent further complications. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes may be necessary before amputation, but hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not indicated in this case.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is an 8-year-old boy who has just returned from a summer camp where he was exposed to other campers and volunteers who are experiencing similar symptoms. This suggests that the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an infectious agent, such as a virus or bacteria, that was transmitted through close contact with others at the summer camp.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epstein-Barr virus can cause similar symptoms to those experienced by the patient, including fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with adenovirus, which is a common cause of viral infections in children. The fact that there is an outbreak among other campers and volunteers also supports this diagnosis.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 3-week-old male infant who has been breast-feeding well and is urinating and having bowel movements normally. He appears adequately hydrated, and his vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that do not come off when gently scraped with a tongue blade. This suggests an oral candidiasis infection, which is typically caused by Candida albicans. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be nystatin, which is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat oral candidiasis infections.",C,"Let's reason step by step. This patient presents with white patches in the mouth, which is a typical symptom of herpes simplex virus infection. Acyclovir is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition. It is an antiviral medication that can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The physician has a duty to act in the best interest of the patient. In this case, the patient has already made an informed decision not to pursue further treatment. The family is now trying to persuade the patient to reconsider their decision. As the physician, it is important to respect the patient' s autonomy and decision-making capacity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'protect the patient' s autonomy'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The physician must prioritize the patient's autonomy, even if it means disregarding the family's wishes. The patient has the right to make her own decisions about her treatment, even if those decisions are not in her best interest. Therefore, the correct answer is D: protect the patient'’s autonomy.",D
D,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The patient has a gunshot wound to the abdomen, which is a life-threatening injury. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a pulse of 120/minute and blood pressure of 70/40 mm Hg. The patient also has decreased breath sounds on the left side, indicating possible lung damage.",-,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the chest is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help to identify the extent of the injury and any associated complications, such as a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Additionally, a CT scan can also help to guide further treatment decisions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's brother and maternal uncle had Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and died at the ages of 28 and 17 years, respectively. This suggests that the patient may be a carrier of the disease. Additionally, the patient's mother has a serum muscle creatine kinase concentration of 300 U/L, which is higher than normal. This further supports the possibility that the patient is a carrier of DMD. Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease is that she is a carrier of DMD.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a carrier of the disease based on her family history of DMD. Since the DMD gene is located on the X chromosome, she has a 50% risk of having a child with DMD. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate assessment of this patient's carrier status for this disease.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma, which is extremely tender to palpation. This suggests that there may be an inflammatory response occurring in this area. Edema is a common manifestation of inflammation, and it can occur due to increased permeability of blood vessels or increased hydrostatic pressure. In this case, the most likely primary mechanism of edema development is disruption of vascular basement membranes, which leads to increased permeability of blood vessels.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The release of thromboxane is the most likely mechanism of edema because it is a potent vasoconstrictor and can cause inflammation. This leads to increased vascular permeability and fluid leakage into the tissues. Therefore, the primary mechanism of edema in this patient is the release of thromboxane.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The hypothesis states that the stress of studying for examinations adversely affects the immune system, making the students more susceptible to infection. To support this hypothesis, we would expect to see some laboratory findings that indicate an impaired immune response. In this case, option B 'Decreased macrophage activity' is most likely to support this hypothesis. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Decreased macrophage activity could indicate an impaired ability of the immune system to respond effectively to infection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Increased basophil count would support the hypothesis that stress adversely affects the immune system because basophils are involved in allergic reactions, which can be exacerbated by stress. Therefore, an increased basophil count during examination week is most likely to support this hypothesis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in a poor condition, with decerebrate posturing and hemodynamic instability. Given his poor prognosis, it would be reasonable to consider organ donation as an option. However, the family needs to be informed and consented before proceeding with organ donation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to arrange for the regional organ procurement organization to address the issue with the patient'\'s family.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician should delay further consideration of the issue until the family seems ready because they are grieving and may not be able to make rational decisions about organ donation. Additionally, delaying further consideration allows the family time to process their emotions and potentially come to a decision that is in line with the patient's wishes.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 5-year-old boy who has been eating dirt for years. His mother says she doesn't know where he gets this habit from, but it's been going on since age 3. The patient's physical examination and laboratory studies are normal. Given the history of eating dirt, I would suspect that the patient may have a pica disorder, which is characterized by eating non-food substances like dirt, chalk, or paper. In this case, the most appropriate next step in management would be to refer the patient to a child psychiatrist for further evaluation and treatment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient should be referred to a child psychiatrist because he has a history of eating dirt and may have a psychological disorder, such as pica. A child psychiatrist can assess the patient's behavior and provide appropriate treatment.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a painless swelling in the left testicle that has varied in size over several months. There is no history of trauma, and the lesion transilluminates well. No inguinal nodes are palpable, and findings from a testicular scan are normal. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has a hydrocele, which is a type of fluid-filled sac that can develop in the scrotum. The most appropriate management for this condition would be to inject a sclerosing agent into the hydrocele to cause it to shrink and eventually disappear.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Needle aspiration is the most appropriate management because it is a less invasive procedure than surgical repair and can be used to diagnose and treat the condition. Additionally, needle biopsy is not necessary in this case as the testicular scan has already ruled out any abnormalities.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient underwent a radical thyroidectomy, which means that the surgeon removed most or all of the thyroid gland. This procedure is typically performed to treat thyroid cancer. After the surgery, the patient developed hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone levels). These findings suggest that there was damage to one or more of the parathyroid glands during the surgery. The most likely explanation is that the surgeon damaged the parathyroid gland(s) on the left side of the neck, which would have caused the hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Damage to a branch of the costocervical trunk caused the findings in this patient because this vessel supplies blood to the parathyroid glands. This can lead to hypocalcemia, which is characterized by low serum calcium levels and high parathyroid hormone levels. In this case, the patient's serum calcium level was 7.5 mg/dL, which is below the normal range of 8.5-10.5 mg/dL.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of head trauma, which is consistent with the basal skull fracture. The patient's symptoms, including polyuria and polydipsia, are consistent with diabetes insipidus. The administration of desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue, increases urine osmolality, indicating that the patient has a deficiency in vasopressin production or action. Therefore, the beneficial effect of desmopressin is most likely due to activation of adenylyl cyclase.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The beneficial effect of desmopressin is most likely due to activation of serine kinase because it is involved in the regulation of water reabsorption in the kidneys. Additionally, the increased serum osmolality and decreased urine osmolality observed in this patient are consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, which is often caused by damage to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary gland.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 19-year-old college student who has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. She has had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin two weeks ago. Given this history, it's likely that the patient has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The symptoms of vaginal irritation and pain with urination are consistent with STIs such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. However, given the patient's recent treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis, it's also possible that the patient has developed a secondary bacterial vaginosis (BV) infection. The symptoms of vaginal irritation and pain with urination are consistent with BV. Furthermore, the pH of the discharge is 4, which is consistent with BV. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of these findings is bacterial vaginosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bacterial vaginosis is the most likely cause of these findings because it is a common cause of vaginal discharge and can cause vaginal irritation and pain with urination. The patient's history of streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin does not suggest an increased risk of bacterial vaginosis, as this infection is typically caused by Gardnerella vaginalis or other anaerobic bacteria. Candidiasis is less likely because the patient's discharge has a pH of 4, which is more acidic than the typical pH range for candidal infections.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient had a total thyroidectomy and excision of enlarged left jugular lymph nodes for follicular carcinoma. This suggests that the patient has undergone surgery to remove cancerous tissue from their neck. Given this information, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are related to the surgical procedure rather than any underlying medical condition. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option D: A drooping left shoulder.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Babinski sign present bilaterally is the most likely finding because it is a sign of upper motor neuron damage, which can be caused by hypocalcemia. Chvostek sign is also possible but less likely because it is more specific for hypocalcemia. Deviation of the tongue to the left side and drooping left shoulder are not related to hypocalcemia.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a low leukocyte count, which is a common side effect of chemotherapy. Filgrastim is a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor that stimulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. It is commonly used to treat neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or other medications. Therefore, filgrastim would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dexamethasone is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to increase this patient's leukocyte count because it is a corticosteroid that can suppress the immune system and allow the bone marrow to recover. This would lead to an increase in the production of white blood cells, including neutrophils and lymphocytes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 12-year-old girl with a 2-month history of intermittent yellowing of the eyes and skin, which is indicative of jaundice. Her serum total bilirubin concentration is 3 mg/dL, with a direct component of 1 mg/dL. This suggests that there may be some degree of liver dysfunction or damage. However, her haptoglobin concentration, AST, and ALT activities are all within the reference ranges, which suggests that there is no evidence of significant liver injury or disease. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be decreased activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Gallstones are the most likely additional finding in this patient because they can cause jaundice. This is because gallstones can block the bile duct, which can lead to a buildup of bilirubin in the blood. This can cause jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, and its increased concentration would directly inhibit this process. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: Fatty acid synthesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The increased malonyl-CoA concentration most likely directly inhibits glycogenolysis because it is a key regulatory enzyme in the breakdown of glycogen. This inhibition would lead to an accumulation of glucose in the blood, which is consistent with the hyperglycemia observed in these subjects.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, swelling in both ankles, and a history of awakening from sleep due to shortness of breath. These symptoms are consistent with heart failure. The presence of jugular venous distension, crackles at the lung bases, and pedal edema further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is an echocardiography.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An ECG is most likely to confirm the diagnosis because it can show evidence of heart damage, such as ST-segment elevation or T-wave inversion. Additionally, an ECG can also help identify any arrhythmias that may be present.",B

Given these findings, the most important next step in management would be to provide education for well-baby care.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The most important next step in management is to begin oral methyldopa because it is an antihypertensive medication that can help to lower her blood pressure. Additionally, it is also important to provide education for well-baby care as the mother is still recovering from childbirth and needs guidance on how to care for her newborn.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 47-year-old man who presents with sudden onset of shortness of breath, severe chest pain, and sweating. He has no history of similar symptoms. His ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which suggests that the patient may have hypertension or cardiac disease. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mitral valve prolapse is the most likely diagnosis because it can cause a systolic murmur and chest pain. The patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG also support this diagnosis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing colicky right flank pain that radiates to the groin and hematuria, which suggests a urinary tract obstruction or inflammation. The ultrasound examination shows right- sided hydronephrosis and a dilated ureter, which further supports the diagnosis of a urinary tract obstruction. Given these findings, it is most likely that uric acid crystals will be found on urinalysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an arthrocentesis to aspirate fluid from the affected joint and send it for culture and Gram stain. This will help determine if there is a bacterial infection present and guide further treatment.",D,Let's reason step by step. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a nuclear scan of the right knee to evaluate for a possible fracture and to assess the extent of the injury. This would be followed by further evaluation with MRI or arthrocentesis if necessary.,A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 100 individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer, and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. This means that the number of deaths from this type of cancer in individuals who took Drug X is equal to the number of deaths from this type of cancer in individuals who did not take the drug. Therefore, we can conclude that the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take the drug is 1.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk is the ratio of the probability of death from cancer in individuals who take Drug X to the probability of death from cancer in individuals who do not take Drug X. So, the relative risk is 100/200 divided by 100/400, which is 2. Therefore, individuals who take Drug X have twice the risk of dying from this type of cancer as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing severe jaw pain despite taking codeine as prescribed. Codeine is a weak opioid that works by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. If the patient has deficiency of μ receptors, it would not be able to bind to these receptors, resulting in therapeutic failure. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure is a deficiency of μ receptors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the patient is taking codeine, which is a prodrug that needs to be metabolized to morphine to exert its effects, decreased absorption of the medication can be a possible explanation for the therapeutic failure. However, since other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine, it's unlikely that this is the sole reason for the therapeutic failure. Therefore, we need to consider other possibilities.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is requesting an MRI of her back, citing a history of breast cancer in her family and concerns about potential neurologic abnormalities. However, the patient's examination findings are normal, and there is no evidence to support the need for an MRI at this time. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action would be to explain to the patient that she does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It is important to protect the patient's privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, it is not appropriate to inform the insurance company without the patient's consent. Additionally, ordering an MRI solely based on the patient's request may not be medically necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate initial action would be to explain to the patient that she does not need the MRI and that it is not appropriate to misrepresent her examination findings.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a significant weight loss. These symptoms are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Additionally, the patient has had a neck mass for more than 10 years, which is consistent with multinodular goiter. Finally, the 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake, which is consistent with multinodular goiter. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is multinodular goiter.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and weight loss are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The neck mass and the findings on 131I scan suggest a thyroid nodule. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Graves' disease.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with symptoms of depression, fatigue, and memory lapses. She also has suicidal ideation without a plan. Given the severity of her symptoms, it's clear that she needs immediate attention and treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment would be to initiate antidepressant therapy, specifically paroxetine therapy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's low hemoglobin concentration and elevated serum ferritin concentration suggest iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to start ferrous sulfate therapy. This will help replenish the body's iron stores and alleviate symptoms of anemia.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 6-year-old boy who has a history of frequent injuries, including fractures and concussions. He also has a history of behavioral problems, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Given these findings, the most likely explanation for his current behavior is ADHD.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of running wildly, talking excessively, and getting out of his seat are consistent with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Additionally, the patient's history of frequent reprimands from teachers for these behaviors further supports the diagnosis of ADHD. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 15-year-old girl who has been experiencing abdominal pain and constipation for several weeks. She is otherwise healthy, with no significant medical history. Given her age and the nature of her symptoms, it would be reasonable to ask about her diet and bowel habits. Specifically, we should ask about the frequency, consistency, and color of her stools, as well as any changes she has noticed in her bowel movements over time.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation could be related to a sexually transmitted disease, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. Therefore, it is important to obtain additional history regarding her sexual activity and potential exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. This would help to determine the most appropriate course of action for this patient.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 40-year-old female with a 2-month history of fatigue, generalized aching and weakness of the proximal muscles of all four extremities. She also has difficulty combing her hair. These symptoms are consistent with polymyositis, which is an inflammatory myopathy that can cause muscle weakness and wasting. The patient's laboratory results support this diagnosis, as she has elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is polymyositis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, proximal muscle weakness, and joint pain are consistent with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, it is important to rule out this diagnosis with further testing. However, the presence of elevated creatine kinase levels and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggests that there may be an underlying inflammatory or degenerative process affecting the muscles. This could be due to polymyositis, fibromyalgia, or other conditions. Therefore, it is important to consider these possibilities in addition to myasthenia gravis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is at high risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) due to his recent surgery, immobility, and underlying medical conditions such as coronary artery disease. Therefore, prophylaxis against DVT is necessary. Among the options provided, oral warfarin (option C) is a commonly used anticoagulant for prophylaxis of DVT in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. It has a long half-life, which allows for once-daily dosing. However, it requires regular monitoring of international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure that the patient is within the therapeutic range.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and his current medical condition make him a high-risk patient for DVT. Therefore, the most appropriate prophylaxis for DVT is oral warfarin, which is a highly effective anticoagulant. Additionally, oral warfarin has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in patients with coronary artery disease.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with pain in his right shoulder, tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus, and painful abduction of the right upper extremity. These symptoms suggest that there is a problem with the rotator cuff muscles or their attachments to the humerus. Given the location of the tenderness and the nature of the pain, it is most likely that the cause of this patient' s condition is a somatic dysfunction of the supraspinatus muscle.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The supraspinatus muscle is located in the shoulder and is responsible for abduction of the arm. Therefore, a somatic dysfunction of this muscle can cause pain and tenderness in the shoulder. Additionally, painful abduction of the right upper extremity is also consistent with a supraspinatus muscle dysfunction.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with right-sided rib pain when running long distances, which suggests that the dysfunction is related to the thoracic spine and ribs. The exhalation dysfunction at ribs 4-5 on the right also supports this conclusion. Therefore, the most useful muscle or muscle group in correcting this dysfunction using a direct method would be the anterior scalene muscles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The anterior scalene muscle is located in the neck and is involved in respiration. Therefore, a dysfunction in this muscle can affect the mechanics of breathing and cause pain in the rib cage. Given that the patient presents with right-sided rib pain when running long distances, it is likely that the dysfunction is related to the mechanics of breathing during exercise. In this case, the most useful muscle or muscle group for correcting this dysfunction using a direct method would be the anterior scalene muscle.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a gravida 3 para 2 female at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which suggests that she may be experiencing some degree of analgesia or anesthesia. Given this information, it would not be appropriate to administer an epidural anesthetic, as this could potentially exacerbate her current level of analgesia or anesthesia. Instead, the most appropriate management would be to continue monitoring her labor and fetal well-being, while also considering other options for pain relief, such as oxytocin augmentation or a change in position.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tocolytic therapy is used to stop labor contractions and delay delivery. However, in this case, the patient is already 7 cm dilated and the fetus is engaged, so it is not appropriate to use tocolytic therapy. Additionally, cervical topical corticosteroids are not typically used for cervical ripening during active labor. Therefore, the most appropriate management would be to",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sensitivity of a diagnostic test is defined as the proportion of true positives among all individuals who have the disease (true positives + false negatives). In this case, we are trying to calculate the sensitivity of a blood test for prostate cancer. To do this, we need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who had a positive test result (true positives) and the total number of men with prostate cancer (true positives + false negatives). This information is not provided in the question, so it is not possible to calculate the sensitivity of the blood test.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sensitivity of a test is the proportion of individuals with the disease who have a positive test result. Therefore, we need to know the number of men with prostate cancer who have a serum prostate-specific antigen concentration greater than 5 ng/mL. This information can be obtained from the number of men with prostate cancer who undergo biopsy procedures and are found to have a serum prostate-specific antigen concentration greater than 5 ng/μL.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old man with type 1 diabetes mellitus who has been noncompliant with his diabetic regimen, including missing insulin doses and not following a healthy diet. He has also been experiencing symptoms of depression, including fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness. Given these circumstances, the most appropriate next step in management would be to schedule neuropsychological testing (Option C). This is because the patient's symptoms are consistent with depression, which may be contributing to his noncompliance with his diabetic regimen.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, irritability, and feelings of hopelessness suggest depression. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient's mental health and consider a referral for a psychiatric evaluation. In this case, option C: Schedule neuropsychological testing is the most appropriate next step in management.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is stuporous, which suggests that the substance taken has caused a significant impairment of consciousness. The pinpoint pupils and sluggish reaction to light suggest that the substance taken is an opioid. Given these symptoms, it is most likely that the patient took heroin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of stupor, pinpoint pupils, and cool, damp skin are consistent with opioid overdose. Therefore, it is important to administer naloxone, which is an opioid antagonist, to reverse the effects of the overdose. This medication can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously.",D
D,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 31-year-old woman who is at 32 weeks' gestation, which means she is in the third trimester of her pregnancy. She has been experiencing progressive dyspnea and wheezing over the past week, which suggests that there may be some kind of respiratory problem. Additionally, she is coughing up bloodstreaked sputum, which indicates that there may be a bleeding disorder or a lung disease. Furthermore, her medical history reveals that she has hypothyroidism, for which she takes levothyroxine. Auscultation of the lungs discloses decreased breath sounds at the bases with expiratory crackles bilaterally. Cardiac examination reveals an irregularly irregular heart rhythm.",-,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing, and a murmur are consistent with mitral stenosis complicated by atrial fibrillation. Therefore, it is important to rule out this diagnosis with further testing. In addition, the patient's history of hypothyroidism may be relevant in evaluating her cardiac condition.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a compression fracture of L1-2 and decreased bone mineral density. This suggests that the patient may have osteoporosis or osteopenia. Bisphosphonate drugs are commonly used to treat these conditions. They work by inhibiting osteoclast activity, which helps to reduce bone resorption and increase bone density. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of this drug is most likely due to its ability to inhibit osteoclast activity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bisphosphonate drugs are a class of medications that inhibit osteoclast activity, which is the process of bone resorption. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of these drugs is due to a decrease in bone resorption and an increase in bone density. This is supported by the fact that bisphosphonates have been shown to be effective in treating conditions such as osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and hypercalcemia.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing nonradiating low back pain, which is a common symptom of musculoskeletal disorders. The patient has had similar episodes in the past that resolved spontaneously. Given these facts, it's likely that this episode is also related to a musculoskeletal disorder rather than a more serious condition such as a spinal fracture or infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to recommend regular activity and analgesia as needed, while monitoring for any signs of worsening symptoms or complications.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bed rest can be helpful in reducing inflammation and pain. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with acute low back pain, which is often caused by muscle strain or ligament sprain. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to encourage regular activity, which can help to strengthen the muscles and improve flexibility. This approach has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of acute low back pain.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis, which is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. The patient has suddenly lost vision in her right eye, which suggests that there may be demyelination occurring in the optic nerve or surrounding structures. Given this information, it is most likely that the condition is a result of demyelination of the optic nerve.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The medial longitudinal fasciculus is a pathway that connects the brainstem to the oculomotor nuclei, which are responsible for the movement of the eyes. The optic nerve is responsible for carrying visual information from the retina to the brain. The oculomotor nerve is responsible for controlling the movement of the eyeball and eyelid. Finally, the trigeminal nerve is responsible for transmitting sensory information from the face to the brain. Given that this patient has a history of multiple sclerosis, it is most likely that demyelination occurred in the optic nerve, leading to vision loss.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The stillborn has an absence of a urethral opening, which is a characteristic feature of cloacal dysgenesis. This condition is often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as genitourinary tract abnormalities and skeletal defects. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this stillborn is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Oligohydramnios is a condition in which there is too little amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. This can lead to problems with the development of the lungs and other organs. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a condition in which there is a hole in the diaphragm, which can allow the contents of the abdomen to move into the chest and compress the lungs. Given that the stillborn has oligohydramnios and no urethral opening, it is most likely that the fetus had congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young woman with a history of inconsistent condom use, which increases her risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The patient presents with a tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus, compromising the introital opening. This suggests that the mass may be an abscess or a Bartholin's cyst. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer intravenous metronidazole, which is effective against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis, which are commonly associated with pelvic infections.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to diagnose and treat a Bartholin's gland abscess. It involves inserting a needle into the abscess and aspirating the fluid, which can then be cultured to identify the cause of the infection. This approach is more likely to provide an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment compared to other options.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The child is a healthy 2-year-old girl, and the physical examination reveals mild bowlegs (10-degree genu varum). This is a normal variant of gait in young children, especially during the toddler years. Therefore, no treatment is needed at this time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency is a common cause of rickets, which can lead to bone deformities, including bowlegs. However, in this case, the child is otherwise healthy and has no other signs or symptoms of rickets. Therefore, it is more likely that the bowlegs are due to a normal developmental variant. In this case, no treatment is needed at this time.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 38-year-old man with Down syndrome and severe mental retardation who was brought to the emergency department because of increasing lethargy for several hours. He has no initial history or past medical history, and he refuses lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid. Toxicologic screening of his urine is negative. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient's condition is related to a central nervous system (CNS) infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a CT scan of the head to rule out any structural abnormalities in the brain and to help guide further management.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the head can help to identify any abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord that may be causing the patient's symptoms. However, in this case, the patient is refusing a lumbar puncture, which is the gold standard for diagnosing meningitis. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to order a CT scan of the head without first obtaining an informed consent from the patient and/or their guardian.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing episodes of severe anxiety, shortness of breath, palpitations, and numbness in her hands and feet. Given the symptoms, it's likely that the patient is experiencing a panic disorder or an anxiety disorder. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be an antidepressant medication such as paroxetine (SSRI). This class of medications has been shown to be effective in treating panic disorders and other anxiety disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lithium carbonate is a mood stabilizer that can be used to treat bipolar disorder. However, it is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication that can be used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that can be used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. It is not typically used to treat anxiety disorders. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant medication that can be used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is taking allopurinol and probenecid for gouty arthritis, which suggests that the patient has a history of uric acid-related problems. The symptoms described, including diffuse exfoliation of the skin with oozing of serous fluid, erythematous and exfoliated mucous membranes in the mouth, suggest a severe reaction to one or more medications. Given the patient's medical history and current symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by an allergic reaction to certain medications.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome is a bacterial infection that can cause blistering and exfoliation of the skin. However, it is typically seen in children and does not usually cause mucous membrane involvement. The patient's history of taking allopurinol and probenecid for gouty arthritis suggests that this may be related to an adverse reaction to one or both of these medications. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 2-week-old newborn who has turned blue on three occasions during feeding, and also sweats during feeding. This suggests that the patient may have a congenital heart defect. The x-ray of the chest shows a small boot-shaped heart and decreased pulmonary vascular markings, which further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Tetralogy of Fallot.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Atrial septal defect is a congenital heart defect that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. This can cause cyanosis and a heart murmur. However, it is not typically associated with sweating during feeding. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that includes four defects: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It can cause cyanosis, clubbing, and a heart murmur. However, it is not typically associated with sweating during feeding. Endocardial fibroelastosis is a rare congenital heart defect that causes the endocardium to become thickened and fibrotic. It can cause a heart murmur, but it is not typically associated with sweating during feeding. Anomalous coronary vessels are a type of congenital heart defect that occurs when the coronary arteries develop abnormally. This can cause symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. However, it is not typically associated with sweating during feeding.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of sickle cell trait and mild anemia, which suggests that there may be some underlying hematological issue. Additionally, the patient is experiencing pitting edema from the mid thigh to the ankles bilaterally, which could indicate cardiac or renal dysfunction. Given these symptoms, I would recommend ordering a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) test to evaluate for cardiac dysfunction and a urinalysis to assess for kidney function.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Toxicology screening of the urine can identify any illicit drug use that may be contributing to the patient's condition.

His symptoms began shortly after a camping trip, and he now is unable to climb stairs, walk long distances, comb his hair, or dress himself. The patient's mother says that she was careful to apply sunscreen on the trip and can recall no tick bites or exposure to poisonous plants. The patient has been taking a topical corticosteroid for dry, scaly patches of skin. He appears weak and lethargic. Given these symptoms, which is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eczema is a skin condition that can cause rashes and itching. However, it does not typically cause muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that causes muscle weakness and atrophy. It often presents with a characteristic rash on the face, neck, and extensor surfaces of joints. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and function. It typically begins in childhood or adolescence and progresses over time. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted through tick bites. It can cause fever, headache, fatigue, and joint pain. However, it does not typically cause skin rashes or muscle weakness. Therefore, based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis.",A

His vital signs are abnormal, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has heat stroke, a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate attention.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Immersing the patient in an ice water bath can help to lower the patient's body temperature quickly. However, it is not recommended for patients with heat stroke, as it can lead to complications such as shivering and vasoconstriction.

Cortical basal ganglionic degeneration is a rare condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline, but it usually presents with motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and dysarthria. Neurosyphilis is a chronic infection caused by the bacterium that causes syphilis. VD.",-
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is deaf and has been using sign language to communicate with her son. In order to ensure good communication during the appointment, it would be best to arrange for a certified interpreter who is familiar with American Sign Language (ASL). This way, the patient can effectively communicate with the healthcare provider.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Writing materials are the most appropriate way to communicate with a deaf patient since they can easily read and understand the information provided that way. The other options, such as having the patient bring her son to the appointment or arranging for a certified interpreter, may not be feasible or effective in this situation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of fever, headache, stiff neck, and vomiting since returning from summer camp 2 days ago. He also has had confusion and agitation for the past 2 hours. Given these symptoms, it is likely that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis caused by an infectious agent. The most likely portal of pathogen entry into this patient's central nervous system is through the olfactory nerve, which is responsible for transmitting odors from the nasal cavity to the brain. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Olfactory nerve.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The facial nerve is located near the nose and mouth, so it is the most likely entry point for the parasite given the symptoms of the patient. Additionally, the patient has a history of summer camp, which increases the likelihood of parasitic infection.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 45-year-old man with AIDS who has been experiencing symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, mild shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough for about a week. He also has a history of pneumonia that required hospitalization three years ago. Given his medical history and current symptoms, it is likely that the patient's condition is related to his AIDS diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to continue with obtaining a thorough history and examining this patient in order to determine the best course of treatment for him.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is homeless and unable to afford his medication, so the most appropriate next step is to arrange a direct admission to the hospital. This will ensure that the patient receives the medical attention he needs, including access to his medications.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 49-year-old man who has undergone left femoral-popliteal bypass grafting for claudication. He now presents with increasing pain in his left foot, which is concerning given the recent surgery. Given this clinical scenario, the most appropriate management would be to perform bedside compartment pressure measurements to assess for possible compartment syndrome.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Doppler ultrasonography of the left lower extremity can help to diagnose the presence of a blood clot, which is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) therapy may be necessary if a blood clot is found and it is causing significant symptoms.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The man consumed an 800-calorie meal and then slept through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. This suggests that the body is able to maintain its blood glucose levels despite not having eaten for several hours. One mechanism that could be responsible for this is continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone that is released from adipose tissues and that helps to regulate appetite and energy expenditure. So leptin release from adipose tissues is the most likely mechanism involved in maintaining the man's serum glucose concentration. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician is having difficulty with the patient because of the patient's behavior, which includes being truant from school and sneaking out of the house. This suggests that the patient may be acting out or expressing feelings of rebellion or frustration. The physician's reaction to the patient, which includes scolding and shaming the patient, suggests that the physician is experiencing countertransference. Countertransference refers to the unconscious feelings or emotions that a therapist or healthcare provider experiences towards their patients. In this case, the physician may be unconsciously reacting to the patient's behavior as if it were their own child's behavior, which could lead to feelings of frustration, anger and helplessness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's reaction to the patient is projection because she is projecting her own feelings of guilt and shame onto the patient. She is feeling guilty about her son's behavior and is projecting those feelings onto the patient. This is an example of a defense mechanism, which is a way that people cope with stress, anxiety, or other uncomfortable emotions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which means she will undergo surgery to remove her gallbladder. Given the patient's age and medical history, it is likely that she has a high risk of developing complications during or after surgery. Therefore, further evaluation is indicated to assess the patient's overall health status and identify any potential risks or complications associated with her upcoming surgery.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sarcopenia is a condition that is characterized by muscle loss and weakness. The patient is experiencing muscle loss and weakness, so sarcopenia is the most likely cause of her symptoms. Additionally, the patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis may also be relevant to this diagnosis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old girl with a migrating serpiginous pruritic perianal rash, nausea, intermittent diarrhea, and a 2.2-kg (5-lb) weight loss over the past 4 weeks. Her leukocyte count is 8000/mm3 with 20% eosinophils. Given these symptoms and laboratory results, it's likely that the patient has an intestinal parasitic infection, such as hookworm or roundworm. Therefore, the most appropriate test to yield an accurate diagnosis would be a microscopic examination of the stool (Option D).",D,"Let's reason step by step. A KOH preparation can be used to identify fungi, which are a common cause of perianal rash. So a KOH preparation is the most likely test to yield an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of weight loss, back pain, and leg swelling. He also has a CT scan showing a mass in the pancreas with liver metastases and encasement of the superior mesenteric artery. Given these findings, it is most likely that the patient's symptoms are caused by advanced pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver and compression of the superior mesenteric artery.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a condition that can cause pancreatic cancer and liver metastases. The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer and liver metastases, so multiple endocrine neoplasia is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Additionally, hypercoagulability from advanced malignancy is also possible, but less likely given the patient's medical history.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing intermittent shooting pain over her right cheek and jaw, which is often triggered by cold air, chewing, tactile stimulation, and brushing her teeth. This suggests that the pain may be related to a trigeminal neuralgia (TN) or possibly a temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). Given this information, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time would be carbamazepine, which is commonly used to treat TN.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Levetiracetam is a anti-convulsant medication, which is used to treat seizures. The patient is experiencing trigeminal neuralgia, which is a type of seizure, so levetiracetam is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Additionally, levetiracetam has been shown to be effective in treating trigeminal neuralgia.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 19-year-old woman who comes to the emergency department because she says she's 'burning up.' Medical history is significant for intravenous drug use, which could lead to endocarditis or other cardiac complications. Physical examination discloses a systolic heart murmur over the precordium, which suggests that there may be some degree of valvular insufficiency or stenosis. Given these findings, an expected physical finding will be increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration) is a sign of right-sided heart failure. The patient has a systolic heart murmur, which is a sign of left-sided heart failure, so a positive Kussmaul sign is an expected physical finding. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Positive Kussmaul sign  (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has developed breasts during the past year. This is an unusual presentation, and it suggests that there may be an underlying hormonal imbalance or other medical condition that needs to be evaluated and treated. In this case, the most likely cause of the patient's breast enlargement is Klinefelter syndrome, which is a genetic disorder characterized by an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY). This condition can cause a range of physical and developmental abnormalities, including breast development in boys.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) is a condition that can cause gynecomastia. The patient has breast enlargement, so seminiferous tubule dysgenesis (Klinefelter syndrome) is the most likely cause of his breast enlargement. Additionally, the patient's height and weight are at the 50th percentile for both, which is consistent with Klinefelter syndrome.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of diarrhea after completing his third course of antibiotics for mastoiditis. This suggests that the patient may have developed antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with AAD, which is often caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Therefore, the most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea is C. diff.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Clostridium difficile is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The patient has been taking antibiotics, so Clostridium difficile is the most likely etiologic agent causing the diarrhea. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with C. difficile infection, including diarrhea and abdominal pain.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 3-year-old white girl who has been living in a homeless shelter with her parents. She was brought to the office for a follow-up visit after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test showed 10 mm of induration at the puncture site, which indicates a positive reaction. Given this information, it is likely that the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) and may be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, the most appropriate step at this time would be to order a test for HIV antibody.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A repeat PPD skin test is the most appropriate step at this time because it is possible that the initial test was not accurate. If the test is positive again, then further evaluation is warranted. On the other hand, if the test is negative, then it is likely that the initial test result was a false positive.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness, which is a common symptom of sleep disorders. Additionally, he has a history of falling asleep on the sofa early in the evening and once fell asleep while driving at night. These symptoms suggest that the patient may be suffering from a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy or sleep apnea. Therefore, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis is a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A multiple sleep latency test is a test that measures how quickly a person falls asleep. The patient has excessive daytime sleepiness, so a multiple sleep latency test is most likely to confirm the diagnosis. This test would help determine whether the patient's excessive daytime sleepiness is due to a sleep disorder or another medical condition.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 19-year-old college student who presents with headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. She has a history of chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her physical examination shows diffuse petechiae, Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The CSF analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Based on these findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is ceftriaxone.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative cocci. The patient has gram-negative cocci in her cerebrospinal fluid, so metronidazole is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Additionally, ceftriaxone is also a good option as it is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that covers gram-negative bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. However, clindamycin and erythromycin are not effective against gram-negative bacteria.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The study is trying to assess the relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma in shipyard workers. To do this, they need a comparison group that has similar characteristics as the exposed group, except for the exposure itself. Since all subjects in the study have chest x-rays, it makes sense to select a comparison group that also has chest x-rays. This way, any differences observed between the exposed and non-exposed groups can be attributed to the asbestos exposure itself, rather than other factors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Addressing confounding is the best rationale for selecting a comparison group that had chest x-rays because it can help to control for other factors that may be associated with mesothelioma. For example, asbestos exposure may be more common among shipyard workers who have had chest x-rays. By controlling for these potential confounders, we can increase the validity of our study findings.",A

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The patient has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus for the past 6 years and has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His daily glucose control is not optimal, as his home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations have ranged from 140-200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. This suggests that his daily glucose control is not optimal. However, his hemoglobin A1c level of 5.4% is relatively low and does not suggest poor glycemic control. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c level is that his glucometer is reading falsely high and should be replaced."",",-,Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c is too large to be explained by other factors. So his hemoglobin A1c is likely a result of laboratory error and should be repeated. This is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy.,C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a 3-week history of fever and warm, red lumps under both arms. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows enlarged, 3-cm, erythematous axillary lymph nodes bilaterally. On palpation, the nodes are tender, fluctuant, and movable. Examination of a fine-needle aspirate from one of the nodes shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cultures of the aspirate grow yellow, beta-hemolytic colonies that are catalase and coagulase positive. A polymerase chain reaction test shows mecA-positive organisms. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be vancomycin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that is effective against Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has Staphylococcus aureus, so ciprofloxacin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Penicillin G and vancomycin are not effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is indicated by the presence of mecA-encoding gene. Rifampin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including MRSA, but it is not the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient because ciprofloxacin has been shown to be more effective than rifampin in treating MRSA infections.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of rheumatic fever as a child, which is a common cause of mitral valve disease. The patient also has a cardiac murmur since early adulthood, which suggests that the mitral valve disease has progressed over time. The chest x-ray shows left atrial enlargement, pulmonary venous engorgement, and a straight left cardiac border, all of which are consistent with mitral stenosis. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is mitral valve stenosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of rheumatic fever and a cardiac murmur, so aortic valve stenosis is the most likely explanation for these findings. The x-ray shows left atrial enlargement, which is consistent with mitral valve disease. However, the presence of pulmonary venous engorgement suggests that the mitral valve disease is secondary to the left-sided heart failure caused by the aortic valve stenosis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate, which is not responding to metoprolol. In this situation, the most appropriate choice would be digoxin, an antiarrhythmic medication that can help convert atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In this case, the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate. Enalapril is a medication that can be used to treat hypertension, which is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation. However, enalapril would not be an appropriate choice in this situation because it does not address the underlying arrhythmia. Instead, metoprolol, which is a beta blocker that can help slow down the heart rate and restore a normal sinus rhythm, would be a more appropriate choice.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing recurrent low back pain, which is not related to any specific activity or trauma. The patient's medical history is remarkable for gestational diabetes mellitus during her pregnancies. Given the patient's BMI of 37 kg/m2 and her history of gestational diabetes, it is likely that she has insulin resistance. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to order an MRI of the lumbosacral spine to rule out any underlying spinal pathology that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's back pain is likely due to a herniated disc, as it is recurrent and located in the lower back. An epidural injection of methylprednisolone can help reduce inflammation and pain associated with a herniated disc. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to administer an epidural injection of methylprednisolone.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 19-year-old woman who noticed a mass in her left breast during monthly breast self-examination. Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer at the age of 40 years, which suggests that there may be a family history of breast cancer. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 2-cm, firm, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple, and there is no palpable axillary adenopathy. Given this information, the most likely diagnosis is infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), which is the most common type of breast cancer. IDC typically presents as a lump in the breast, and it can be diagnosed with imaging tests such as mammography and ultrasound.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age and family history, along with the presence of a firm, mobile mass, suggest a more serious condition like intraductal papilloma, which is a benign tumor of the breast. However, given the patient's young age and family history, it is also possible that this could be an early stage of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, which would require further evaluation and treatment.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is HIV-positive, which means she has a viral load that can potentially transmit to her infant during pregnancy or childbirth. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: Amniocentesis is recommended to rule out congenital HIV infection.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Amniocentesis is a common test for detecting chromosomal abnormalities, but it can also be used to rule out congenital HIV infection. This is because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Therefore, amniocentesis should be recommended to rule out congenital HIV infection.",A

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, aborta 1, at 28 weeks' gestation. She has had one previous pregnancy resulting in a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks' gestation. Today, her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 28-week gestation. Fetal ultrasonography shows a male fetus with no abnormalities. Her blood group is O, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. The physician recommends administration of Rho immune globulin to the patient. This treatment is most likely to prevent which of the following in this mother?"",",-,"Let's reason step by step. Rho(D) immune globulin is given to Rh-negative mothers to prevent the development of natural killer cells, which are a type of white blood cell that can attack foreign cells. The administration of Rho(D) immune globulin prevents the formation of antibodies to RhD in the mother's bloodstream, thereby preventing the potential for hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 72-year-old woman who has been experiencing symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and cough for the past three days. She is also frail. Physical examination shows tachypnea and equal pulses bilaterally. Percussion of the chest shows dullness over the right lower lung field. Laboratory studies show arterial hypoxemia and decreased PCO2. A chest x-ay shows an area of opacification in the lower region of the right lung. Given these symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging study results, it is most likely that this patient has a pulmonary embolism (PE).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with emphysema, a chronic lung disease that causes shortness of breath and chest pain. Emphysema is characterized by the destruction of alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs. This destruction leads to a decrease in lung function, making it difficult for the patient to breathe. The patient' s chest x-ray shows an area of opacification in the lower region of the right lung, which is consistent with emphysema. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient' s condition is emphysema.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The neonate is born at 36 weeks' gestation and has a birth weight of 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz). The infant's vital signs are temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Meconium aspiration syndrome can cause respiratory distress in newborns, and the patient's history of meconium-stained amniotic fluid suggests this diagnosis. Meconium aspiration syndrome is a condition that occurs when a baby breathes in meconium, which is a thick, tarry substance that is present in the amniotic fluid. This can cause respiratory distress in newborns and may require treatment with oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, or surfactant therapy.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of anaphylactic response to penicillin, which means she is allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cephalexin. Therefore, we cannot use any beta-lactam antibiotic for this patient. Instead, we need to choose an antibiotic that does not belong to the beta-lactam class. Based on the patient's history of developing a rash after taking erythromycin, which is a macrolide antibiotic, it seems unlikely that she would be allergic to clindamycin, which is another macrolide antibiotic. Therefore, we can consider using clindamycin as an alternative antibiotic for this patient. However, before making any final decision, we should also consider the patient's medical history and current health status, as well as the severity of her symptoms and the potential risks and benefits of each antibiotic option.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Clarithromycin is in the same class of antibiotics as erythromycin, so it is possible that the patient could have a similar reaction to clarithromycin. However, clindamycin is a different class of antibiotic and is not known to cross-react with erythromycin. Therefore, clindamycin would be a safer choice for this patient.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not had a menstrual period for 6 months. She appears emaciated, which suggests that she may have an eating disorder or malnutrition. Her low body mass index (BMI) of 15 kg/m2 also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, her pulse and blood pressure are within normal limits, which suggests that her heart rate and blood pressure are not significantly affected by her malnutrition. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's amenorrhea is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to malnutrition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with hypothyroidism, a condition that can cause irregular periods. Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone, which is essential for many bodily functions, including menstruation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 72-year-old woman with advanced ovarian cancer metastatic to the liver, hypertension, and major depressive disorder. She has received chemotherapy for 2 years and is currently taking oxycodone (10 mg twice daily), hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d), and fluoxetine (20 mg/d). The patient's current medications are causing her to experience pain, which she rates as a 1-2 on a scale of 0-10. Given this information, the most appropriate next step in management would be to assess for suicidal ideation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Oxycodone is a strong opioid pain reliever, and increasing the dosage may help to manage the patient's pain. However, it is important to consider the patient's other medical conditions, such as hypertension and major depressive disorder, before increasing the dosage. Additionally, the patient has been taking oxycodone for 2 years, which suggests that she may have developed tolerance to the medication. Therefore, increasing the dosage may not be the most appropriate next step in management.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 35-year-old man who has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. He now complains of pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. Given this information, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are related to avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which is a known complication of long-term glucocorticoid use.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Osteoporosis is a common condition in older adults that can cause bone pain and fractures. However, the patient's age and symptoms suggest a more specific diagnosis, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This condition typically affects younger adults and causes hip pain, stiffness, and limited mobility.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is seeking a legal document signed, which suggests that he may be experiencing some level of distress or anxiety related to this situation. Therefore, the most appropriate approach would be to use a more structured and controlled method of assessment, such as administering amobarbital and then interviewing the patient.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Amobarbital is a barbiturate that can be used to reduce anxiety and improve recall, but it is not the best way to confirm the diagnosis of PTSD. The best way to confirm the diagnosis is to interview the patient and obtain a detailed history of the traumatic event and the patient's symptoms. This approach allows for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a necrotizing wound with purplish black discoloration, crepitant bullae and profuse serous drainage. This is consistent with a severe soft tissue infection. The Gram stain of the tissue biopsy specimen shows gram-positive rods, which suggests that the causative organism is likely to be Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Both of these organisms are known to produce virulence factors such as fimbriae, pneumolysin and polysaccharide capsule. However, the most relevant virulence factor in this case would be the production of alpha-toxin by S. aureus. Alpha-toxin is a potent exotoxin that can cause necrosis and tissue destruction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with gas gangrene, which is caused by Clostridium perfringens. Clostridium perfringens produces a toxin called alpha-toxin, which is responsible for the tissue damage seen in gas gangrene.

The patient's physical examination reveals severe lower quadrant tenderness bilaterally, purulent cervical discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, but the urine pregnancy test is negative. Based on these findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be",D,"Let's reason step by step. Oral azithromycin is a common antibiotic used for treating sexually transmitted infections, but it is not the best option for treating pelvic inflammatory disease. The best option for treating pelvic inflammatory disease is intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. This combination provides broad-spectrum coverage against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as anaerobic bacteria.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a deep sacral sulcus on the left, a posterior inferior lateral angle on the right, and a lumbosacral junction that springs freely on compression. These findings suggest that there is a torsion or twisting of the sacrum, which is causing the symptoms. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a sacral torsion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a left-on-left sacral torsion, which is a common type of sacral torsion. Sacral torsion is a condition in which the sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine, is rotated out of alignment. This can cause pain and stiffness in the lower back and pelvis. In this case, the patient' s symptoms are consistent with a left-on-left sacral torsion.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing urticaria, which is a type of skin reaction characterized by itchy, red, and swollen hives. Given that this is the patient's first episode of urticaria and it has occurred several times in the past week, it is likely that this is an acute allergic reaction rather than a chronic condition. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be to determine the serum IgE concentration.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Urticaria can be caused by allergies, so referring the patient to an allergist may be a good idea. However, there are many other possible causes of urticaria, so it is important to rule out other causes before referring the patient to an allergist. In this case, the most appropriate course of action would be to determine the total eosinophil count and then refer the patient to an allergist if necessary.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of untreated hypertension, which is a risk factor for anaphylaxis. After receiving the influenza vaccine, she developed shortness of breath, hives, and angioedema, which are all symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Therefore, it is most likely that an inquiry about an egg allergy would have prevented this reaction.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A heterophile agglutination test is a test for infectious mononucleosis, but it is not the best way to prevent this reaction. The best way to prevent this reaction is to inquire about an egg allergy, as the influenza virus vaccine is made with eggs. If the patient has an egg allergy, they should receive an egg-free vaccine or alternative treatment.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has swallowed a nail, which is a foreign body that can cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of HIV infection and is currently being treated with antiretroviral therapy. He also has a history of syphilis, genital herpes, and anal- receptive intercourse. Given these risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is anorectal gonorrhea or chlamydia. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time would be metronidazole.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, but it is not the best option for treating this patient's symptoms. The best option for treating this patient's symptoms is imiquimod, which is a topical medication that is used to treat anal warts. Imiquimod works by stimulating the immune system to fight off the virus that causes genital warts.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 2-year-old boy who presents with respiratory distress, inspiratory stridor, and tachypnea. These symptoms are consistent with an acute asthma attack or bronchospasm. Given the patient's age and symptoms, racemic epinephrine administration via nebulizer is the most appropriate next step in management.",C,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Intravenous aminophylline therapy is a medication that can be used to relax the airways, but it is not the best way to treat this patient's symptoms. The best way to treat this patient's symptoms is oral dexamethasone therapy, which is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation in the airways.",-
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has active ankylosing spondylitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. Despite treatment with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sulfasalazine, the patient's symptoms have not improved. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's condition has progressed to a point where more aggressive treatment is necessary. In this case, the most appropriate next step in treatment would be administration of a drug that inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1). This type of medication is known as an anti-TNF agent.",D,"Let's reason step by step. IL-1 is a key inflammatory mediator that plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis, so it is a logical choice. Additionally, sulfasalazine and conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not been effective, suggesting that a different approach may be needed.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks, which is not accompanied by fever or weight loss. Given that the patient does not have any history of lung disease and does not smoke, it is unlikely that the cough is caused by a respiratory infection. Furthermore, given that the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with enalapril, it is unlikely that the cough is caused by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this patient'’s cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. ACE inhibitors decrease plasma renin activity and therefore decrease the formation of angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. This decrease in blood pressure could explain the cough. However, this mechanism does not directly relate to the patient's hypertension or the medication she is taking.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a previously healthy 24-year-old woman who has been experiencing a low-grade fever and a nonproductive cough for 7 days. She has been able to continue her daily activities, which suggests that the illness is not severe. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs, which is consistent with pneumonia. Given these findings, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy would be an antibiotic that covers a wide range of bacterial pathogens, such as ciprofloxacin.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Amoxicillin is a first-line antibiotic for community-acquired pneumonia, which is a likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings. Cefaclor is not typically used to treat pneumonia, and ciprofloxacin is generally reserved for more severe or complicated cases of pneumonia. Erythromycin may be effective against some types of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is not as commonly used as amoxicillin.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is taking pharmacotherapy. Four weeks later, her hepatic glucose output is decreased, and target tissue glucose uptake and utilization are increased. This suggests that the medication is working effectively to lower blood sugar levels. Given this information, it is most likely that the patient was prescribed metformin.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glyburide is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin release from the pancreas and therefore increases the uptake and utilization of glucose in target tissues. Metformin, on the other hand, is a biguanide that primarily works by reducing hepatic glucose output and increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Given the patient's diagnosis with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the medication's mechanism of action, it is most likely that metformin was prescribed for this patient.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The single nucleotide change found in the patient and her mother is not a disease-causing mutation, as it does not change the amino acid at that locus. Furthermore, the presence of this single nucleotide change in 15 out of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome suggests that it is a polymorphism. Therefore, the best description for the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother is a polymorphism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mother's genetic makeup shows the same single nucleotide change as the patient, but she does not show any clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome. This suggests that the change is not a disease-causing mutation, but rather a polymorphism or a sequence variant of unknown significance. Therefore, option B 'It is a polymorphism' best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing a specific pattern of urinary symptoms, which are triggered by air travel and cease when she arrives at her destination. This suggests that the symptoms may be related to anxiety or stress caused by flying. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to recommend behavioral therapy to help the patient manage her anxiety and reduce the frequency and severity of her symptoms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms seem to be related to stress, as they begin a few days before she is going to fly and stop after she arrives at her destination. Therefore, avoiding any stressful activities that cause the problem might be a good solution. Additionally, recommending behavioral therapy could also be helpful in managing the patient's anxiety.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a non-smoker, non-drinker, and does not take any medications. She has regular menstrual cycles with normal bleeding patterns. Her diet consists of no meat, fish, or dairy products. Given these factors, the most likely factor that would decrease the risk of fetal anomalies in this patient is folic acid supplementation prior to conception. Folic acid is a crucial nutrient for preventing neural tube defects and other congenital anomalies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium supplementation is important for bone health and is often recommended during pregnancy. Therefore, it would be a logical choice to recommend calcium supplementation to decrease the risks of fetal anomalies. However, upon closer examination, we can see that option B, beginning folic acid supplementation prior to conception, is actually more strongly supported by evidence. Folic acid supplementation has been consistently shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects and other birth defects. Therefore, it would be a more effective choice to recommend folic acid supplementation to decrease the risks of fetal anomalies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's blood pressure is already elevated at 165/95 mm Hg, which suggests that there may be an underlying mechanism contributing to this elevation. Given the absence of any other abnormalities on physical examination and the fact that the patient is not taking any medications, it is likely that the underlying mechanism contributing to the patient's elevated blood pressure is related to increased peripheral vascular resistance. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: Increased peripheral vascular resistance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Decreased stroke volume leads to decreased cardiac output, which in turn leads to decreased blood pressure. Therefore, it is not a logical choice to select this option. On the other hand, increased peripheral vascular resistance can lead to increased blood pressure. This makes sense because increased resistance means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the vessels, leading to increased blood pressure. Therefore, the most likely mechanism to increase blood pressure further in this patient is increased peripheral vascular resistance.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a 3-day history of increasing pain, tenderness, and swelling near the fingernail of his right index finger. He rates the pain as an 8 on a 10-point scale. Given these symptoms, it is likely that the patient has a bacterial infection, possibly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start oral cefazolin therapy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Paronychia is a bacterial infection, and cefazolin is an antibiotic that is effective against many common bacteria that cause paronychia. Therefore, oral cefazolin therapy would be the most appropriate next step in management.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 75-year-old woman who presents with band-like, burning pain in her right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. Physical examination discloses no abdominal tenderness to palpation. Findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder are normal. Serum amylase concentration is within the reference range. Given these findings, it is unlikely that the patient has a pancreatitis or cholecystitis. The most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster, which can cause referred pain in the upper abdomen and back.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including band-like, burning pain in the right upper abdomen extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back, are consistent with diverticulitis of the cecum. Additionally, the fact that there is no abdominal tenderness to palpation and normal ultrasonography findings suggest that this diagnosis is more likely than other possibilities such as pancreatitis or cholecystitis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy to quit smoking. Bupropion, also known as Zyban, is an antidepressant medication that has been approved for use in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help people quit smoking. However, when used in combination with NRT, bupropion can increase the risk of certain side effects, including seizures, especially in patients who have a history of seizure disorders or who are taking other medications that may lower the seizure threshold. Therefore, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both nicotine patches and bupropion therapy can have side effects, including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. These side effects can lead to dehydration, which can potentially lead to renal insufficiency. Additionally, the combination of these two therapies may increase the risk of adverse effects. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for renal insufficiency.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a long history of varying physical symptoms, but despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations, definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found. This suggests that the patient may be experiencing somatic symptom disorder or conversion disorder. Additionally, the patient's dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, as well as her conflicting statements about her history, are also consistent with histrionic personality disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is somatic symptom disorder or conversion disorder, possibly complicated by histrionic personality disorder.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are consistent with conversion disorder, as she has a history of varying physical symptoms without any definitive causes. She also gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms. This is consistent with the criteria for conversion disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is conversion disorder.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, which is a relatively short period of time to experience an adverse effect from the medication. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a typical antidepressant side effect. Therefore, it is unlikely that the worsening tremor is due to an adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy. The patient's bereavement reaction and early Parkinson disease can be ruled out based on the patient's medical history and physical examination findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's worsening tremor is an increase in alcohol consumption.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's worsening tremor may be due to bereavement reaction, as she is grieving the death of her husband. Bereavement can cause a variety of physical and emotional symptoms, including tremors. However, the patient has been taking fluoxetine for the past 3 weeks, which makes it less likely that the worsening tremor is related to bereavement reaction. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient' s worsening tremor is an adverse effect of fluoxetine therapy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of lung cancer treated with radiation therapy, which could be causing the easy bruising. However, the patient's platelet count is low, which suggests that there may be an underlying bone marrow disorder. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a bone marrow aspiration.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the abdomen can identify any potential causes of easy bruising, such as internal bleeding or organ damage. Therefore, it is a logical choice to order this test. However, it is not the most specific or sensitive test for diagnosing the underlying cause of easy bruising in this patient.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a bloody nose that has been dripping out his nares for the past 2 hours. He denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose. Past medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Examination of the nasal passages reveals that the site of the bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. Given these findings, the most likely site of origin of this patient's epistaxis is the Kiesselbach plexus.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The anterior turbinate is located in the nasal cavity and is a common site of epistaxis. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may also contribute to the development of epistaxis.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, which is consistent with a thrill. A thrill is typically caused by an abnormal communication between two blood vessels, such as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). AVFs are often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as a thrill or bruit. In this case, the patient has dilated varicose veins with incompetent valves in the lower leg, which is consistent with chronic venous insufficiency. However, the presence of an AVF would be more likely to cause symptoms such as a thrill or bruit, rather than just chronic venous insufficiency. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is an arteriovenous fistula (AVF).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including a buzzing sensation adjacent to the scar, a loud murmur, and dilated varicose veins, are consistent with an occlusion of the superficial femoral artery. This is because the superficial femoral artery is responsible for supplying blood to the lower extremities, including the thigh and leg. An occlusion of this artery would result in decreased blood flow to these areas, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, and tingling.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 72-year-old woman who has smoked 20 cigarettes daily for the past 38 years. She begins using eyedrops for glaucoma and three days later, she experiences marked shortness of breath while walking up a flight of stairs. This sudden onset of symptoms suggests that the eyedrop may be causing an allergic reaction or an adverse effect on the patient's respiratory system. Among the options provided, Timolol is the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Epinephrine is a beta-agonist that can cause bronchodilation, which can lead to shortness of breath. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and glaucoma treatment with eyedrops also support the selection of epinephrine as the most likely cause of the development of shortness of breath in this patient.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young man with three flesh-colored lesions on the shaft of his penis that are 10 mm in diameter. On application of a dilute solution of acetic acid, the lesions turn white. This suggests that the lesions may be condylomata acuminata (genital warts). Given this information, the most appropriate next step in management would be to start treatment with an antiviral medication such as imiquimod or podofilox.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including three nontender lesions on his penis, are consistent with genital herpes. Oral acyclovir therapy is the standard treatment for genital herpes. Therefore, oral acyclovir therapy is the most appropriate next step in management.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk ratio (RRR) is 1.2, which means that the risk of hip fracture among those who exercise regularly is 20% higher than among those who do not exercise regularly. However, since the confidence interval (CI) is wide and includes 1, we cannot conclude that there is a statistically significant increase in risk. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is that there is no statistically significant overall decrease or increase in risk.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The relative risk ratio of 1.2 indicates that the risk for hip fracture is 1.2 times higher in those who exercise regularly compared to those who do not. However, the 95% confidence interval of 1.1 to 1.8 suggests that the true effect size is likely between 1.1 and 1.8, which means that the risk for hip fracture is still increased in those who exercise regularly. Therefore, the most appropriate conclusion is that there is a statistically significant overall increase in risk for hip fractures among those who exercise regularly.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 6-day-old breast-fed boy who has been experiencing poor weight gain, irritability, and vomiting since delivery. His physical examination shows jaundice and hepatomegaly. A reducing substance test result of the urine is positive, and a glucose oxidase test result is negative. These findings suggest that the patient may have a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). CDGs are a group of inherited disorders caused by defects in the synthesis or processing of glycans. The most common type of CDG is CDG-Ia, which is caused by mutations in the ALG6 gene. This gene encodes an enzyme called dolichol-phosphate-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of glycoproteins. In this patient, a reducing substance test result of the urine is positive, and a glucose oxidase test result is negative. These findings suggest that the patient may have an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of glycans. The most likely diagnosis is CDG-Ia caused by mutations in the ALG6 gene.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is a key intermediate in glycolysis, and its concentration is increased in conditions that increase glycolysis, such as exercise or hypoxia. Therefore, it is a logical choice to select this option. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with galactosemia, which is a genetic disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize galactose due to a deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Therefore, it is also possible that the patient has galactosemia. However, without further information or testing, it is difficult to determine which option is most likely correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 1-year-old male who has suffered burns in a stocking and glove distribution, which suggests that he was burned while his hands and feet were submerged in hot water. This is consistent with the mother's report that the child turned on the hot water in the bathtub while she was answering the telephone in the bedroom. Given this information, it is likely that the burn injuries are a result of neglect or abuse, rather than an accident. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to contact child protective services.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The child's symptoms seem to indicate a severe allergic reaction, possibly due to a food allergy or insect bite. Intravenous steroids are often used to treat such reactions. Additionally, the child should be monitored closely for any signs of respiratory distress or other complications.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a visible anal mass, which is most likely to be a rectal cancer. If the biopsy confirms that the mass is malignant, it is most appropriate to evaluate the lymph nodes in the pelvis and abdomen for possible metastasis. Specifically, we should evaluate the internal iliac, obturator, sacral, and presacral lymph nodes, as well as the lymph nodes along the common iliac vessels and the aortic bifurcation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sacral lymph nodes are located near the anal mass, so they would be the first to receive any cancer cells that spread from the tumor. Therefore, it is most appropriate to evaluate the sacral lymph nodes for possible metastasis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 67-year-old woman who has been experiencing fatigue, dry skin, brittle hair, swelling of the ankles, and cold intolerance for 1 year. She has also gained 9 kg (20 lb) during this period. Her pulse is 55/minute, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. She appears lethargic. Examination shows dry skin and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. There is mild edema of the ankles bilaterally. The relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex is greatly prolonged. Based on these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and an enlarged thyroid gland, are suggestive of a multinodular goiter, which is a common condition in older women. Additionally, the prolonged relaxation phase of the Achilles reflex suggests hypothyroidism, which is consistent with the diagnosis of multinodular goiter.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 64-year-old female who presents with difficulty swallowing saliva, slurred speech, wasting and fasciculation of the tongue, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and fasciculation in the left lower extremity. The deep tendon reflexes of the left upper extremity are hyperactive. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, are consistent with Friedreich ataxia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. Additionally, the patient's decreased deep tendon reflexes and fasciculation in the left lower extremity support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Friedreich ataxia.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a 2-month history of diffuse weakness and tingling of her arms and legs. Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities, exaggerated knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes, decreased sensation to vibration and position in all extremities, but more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamine deficiency can cause neurological problems, such as weakness and tingling in the extremities, which are similar to the patient's symptoms. Additionally, thiamine deficiency can also cause muscle wasting, which is not mentioned in the patient' s symptoms. Therefore, based on the patient' s symptoms, it is most likely that the patient has a deficiency of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine).",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is quadriplegic, which means he has no motor function in his arms and legs. He also has a skin lesion on the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Given these facts, it's clear that the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion would be to use wet-to-dry dressings. This type of dressing is designed to promote healing by keeping the wound moist and clean.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's skin lesion appears to be a pressure ulcer, which is a common complication in patients who are immobile. Whirlpool therapy is often used to treat pressure ulcers. It helps to reduce the pressure on the affected area and promotes healing. Therefore, whirlpool therapy would be the most effective intervention for this patient'’s skin lesion.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a history of hypertension, currently taking no medications. Her blood pressure has been increasing over the past year, and her current blood pressure reading is 150/90 mm Hg. Given this information, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate an exercise and weight reduction program.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's hypertension could be due to an underlying hormonal imbalance, such as Cushing's syndrome, which would require testing for urine corticosteroid concentrations. Alternatively, the patient may have a pheochromocytoma, which would require testing for urine catecholamine concentrations.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 7-year-old male who is experiencing school problems, including inattentiveness and difficulty following sequential instructions. Additionally, the patient has been observed to drift off to sleep during class. A polysomnogram reveals obstructive sleep apnea. Given these findings, the most appropriate management would be to address the underlying sleep disorder through elevation of the head of the bed, heart rate and apnea monitoring, or surgical evaluation if necessary.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Elevating the head of the bed would help to reduce airway obstruction and improve the patient's sleep apnea. Heart rate and apnea monitoring are important for monitoring the patient' s condition, but they do not directly address the underlying cause of the sleep apnea. Imipramine is a medication that can be used to treat obstructive sleep apnea, but it is not the most appropriate treatment in this case. Surgical evaluation is necessary to determine if surgical intervention is necessary to correct any anatomical abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient' s sleep apnea.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 3-year-old girl who has been treated with amoxicillin for the past 5 days for left otitis media. She now presents with fever and left ear pain, which suggests that her condition may not be improving or may even have worsened. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms are consistent with mastoiditis, which is an infection of the mastoid air cells behind the tympanic membrane. The patient's examination findings, including the displaced forward and laterally position of the left ear, edema and tenderness behind the left ear, and a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move, are also consistent with mastoiditis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is mastoiditis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including ear pain, fever, and dizziness, are consistent with labyrinthitis, which is a common cause of ear infections. Additionally, the patient's otoscopic examination shows a red, dull tympanic membrane that does not move, which is also consistent with labyrinthitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is labyrinthitis.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 40-year-old man who comes to the office for a preemployment physical examination. He has no significant medical history and takes no routine medications. Vital signs are normal, and physical examination shows a palpable nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration is within the reference range. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland confirms a solid, 1-cm nodule. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in evaluation would be to perform fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule. FNA is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide valuable information about the nature and behavior of the nodule.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A CT scan of the neck would provide more detailed images of the thyroid nodule and surrounding tissues, which could help to determine the nature of the nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a fine needle into the nodule to collect cells for cytological examination. This can help to diagnose whether the nodule is benign or malignant. A radionuclide thyroid scan uses small amounts of radioactive material to visualize the thyroid gland and its function. This can help to determine if the nodule is functioning properly or not. Thyroidectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing part or all of the thyroid gland. This is typically done in cases where the nodule is malignant or causing significant symptoms.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with a severe case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which is caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. This bacterium infects the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and causes inflammation and damage to these cells. The most effective antibiotic for this disorder will interfere with which of the following cellular processes or enzymes? In this case, the correct answer is C: Proteasomal degradation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a bacterial infection, and the antibiotic would likely interfere with bacterial protein synthesis. This process involves multiple enzymes, including ribosomes, which assemble amino acids into proteins. Therefore, the most effective antibiotic for this patient's disorder will interfere with ribosomal assembly.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a gravida 3 para 2 female at 39 weeks' gestation in active labor. She had been having regular contractions every 4 minutes, but is now having only a few intermittent, weak contractions. She has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours. Examination shows no reason for obstructed labor. The fetal head is engaged, the membranes are intact, the fetal heart tones are normal, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 7 cm dilated. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypotonic uterine dysfunction.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including irregular and weak contractions, are consistent with Braxton Hicks contractions, which are a normal part of pregnancy. However, the patient has received medication for pain twice in the past 6 hours, which suggests that her contractions may be more intense than typical Braxton Hicks contractions. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary dysfunctional labor.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a 2-month history of heat intolerance, weight loss, tachycardia, and diffuse goiter. This suggests that the patient has hyperthyroidism. The examination reveals exophthalmos, inflammation of the periorbital tissue and conjunctivae, a heart rate of 140/min, and warm, velvety skin. These findings are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the MRI will most likely reveal diffuse enlargement of the rectus muscles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including exophthalmos and goiter, could be due to lymphoma, which can affect the thyroid gland and surrounding tissues. Additionally, the patient's warm, velvety skin and tachycardia are also consistent with lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: lymphoma.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a minor, and as such, she requires the consent of a parent or legal guardian before undergoing any medical treatment. In this case, the patient has not provided written consent from at least one of her parents. Therefore, the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem would be to obtain written consent from at least one of her parents.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A court order is necessary to evaluate a minor if the minor does not consent to treatment, but in this case, the minor has consented to evaluation. Therefore, obtaining written consent from at least one of her parents is the most appropriate step prior to evaluating this patient's rectal problem.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young female with a history of nausea and vomiting, which could be related to various conditions such as gastroenteritis, food poisoning, or even a more serious condition like appendicitis. Given the patient's age and the presence of blood in her vomit, it would be reasonable to suspect that she may have a gastrointestinal tract injury or bleeding. Therefore, the most appropriate initial test to order would be an abdominal flat plate radiography (AXR) to evaluate for any signs of bowel obstruction, free air under the diaphragm, or other abnormalities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A complete blood count would provide information about the patient's overall health, including her red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and platelet count. However, this test is not directly related to the patient' s symptoms of nausea and vomiting with blood in her vomit. Therefore, a more targeted test such as an abdominal flat plate radiography or an amylase level would be more appropriate.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 6-month-old male Hispanic infant who has been experiencing intermittent swelling of his right scrotum that is more pronounced when he cries. The swelling has never been red or 'stuck.' Vital signs are normal. A right inguinal hernia is confirmed on physical examination. Given the age and nature of the condition, it would be most appropriate to inform the parents that herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A hernia is a serious condition that can lead to complications, such as bowel obstruction or strangulation, so it is important to schedule herniorrhaphy as soon as possible. Additionally, delaying the surgery may increase the risk of complications and worsen the patient's overall health.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 26-year-old male police officer who has had cold- and exercise-induced asthma for the past 14 years. He takes no other medications except for his albuterol inhaler, which he uses one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness. Given this information, it seems that the patient's symptoms are well-controlled with his current treatment regimen. Therefore, there is no need to initiate a daily corticosteroid inhaler or increase the use of the albuterol inhaler. Instead, the most appropriate management would be to continue monitoring the patient's symptoms and adjust his treatment plan as needed.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the use of the albuterol inhaler would provide quick relief of the patient's symptoms, but it is not a long-term solution for managing asthma. Fexofenadine therapy is used to treat allergic rhinitis and urticaria, which are not related to this patient's condition. Chest x-ray is not necessary in this case as there is no indication of pneumonia or other thoracic pathology. Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler would be an appropriate management option for this patient, as it can help to reduce inflammation and improve lung function.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing episodes of dizziness, rotatory vertigo, and imbalance. She also reports decreased hearing, tinnitus, a sense of fullness in the right ear, and vomiting. These symptoms are consistent with benign positional vertigo (BPV). BPV is a common condition that affects the inner ear and causes brief episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. The patient's mild hearing loss in the right ear may also be related to BPV. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is benign positional vertigo.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss, are consistent with benign positional vertigo, which is a common cause of dizziness. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not typical of other conditions such as acoustic neuroma, brain stem transient ischemic attacks, or Meniere's disease.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of self-mutilation and has intentionally burned his thigh with a cigarette lighter. He also reports soaking his thigh in hot water and massaging it, which led to the drainage of greenish fluid from the wound sites. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has developed an infection, possibly due to the introduction of bacteria into the wound site through the self-mutilation or the soaking of the wound in hot water. The most appropriate next step would be to begin antibiotic therapy and transfer the patient to a burn center for further management.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's injuries are severe and require specialized care, so he should be transferred to a burn center. Additionally, the patient has a history of self-mutilation and may have underlying psychological issues that need to be addressed.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing chest pain radiating to his jaw, which is a classic symptom of angina pectoris or acute coronary syndrome. The fact that the patient's pulse is 80/minute and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg suggests that the patient may be experiencing an acute coronary event. Given this information, the most appropriate immediate treatment would be to administer a drug with which of the following mechanisms of action? The correct answer is B: Increases nitric oxide concentration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a heart attack, and epinephrine is a drug that increases cAMP concentration and can help to improve heart function. Therefore, the most appropriate immediate treatment is epinephrine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old boy who has been experiencing symptoms of fever, sore throat, and fatigue for the past 2 days. He also has a history of unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner. Given these symptoms and risk factors, it's likely that the patient has contracted an STI, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate suggests that the infection is caused by a viral agent, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes infectious mononucleosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The main symptom in this case is the high fever. He likely acquired the disease from his partner, which suggests that it is infectious. He is likely infected by a virus causing high fever. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus and typically presents with fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. Given these symptoms, IM is the most likely diagnosis.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing severe dyspnea, unable to complete a sentence, with an oxygen saturation of 84% on 4 L of oxygen. Given her previous experience with intubation and sepsis during her hospital stay, it's reasonable to assume that the patient has significant respiratory distress and may require immediate medical attention. In this scenario, the most appropriate step would be to admit the patient to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's worsening shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation indicate a need for increased respiratory support. A home continuous positive airway pressure machine could provide the necessary assistance and improve her oxygen levels, allowing her to remain comfortable at home. However, this option is not suitable as it may not be able to provide adequate support for the patient' s condition. Therefore, the most appropriate step would be to arrange for consultation with a home hospice team.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing moderately severe headaches that are present when he awakens in the morning and are relieved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has no prior history of headaches. Given these symptoms, it's likely that the headaches are related to his recent promotion and relocation. In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to order a CT scan of the head to rule out any structural abnormalities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally is a sign of papilledema, which can be caused by increased intracranial pressure. Increased intracranial pressure can be caused by a brain tumor, which can cause seizures. Thus, an EEG is needed to assess for the presence of seizures. Additionally, a CT scan of the head may also be necessary to rule out other causes of papilledema such as a subdural hematoma or a cerebral edema.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampulla, which is a part of the fallopian tube. Given that the rupture has occurred into the surrounding tissue, it's likely that the fluid from this rupture will be found in the lesser peritoneal cavity or the pouch of Douglas, both of which are locations where fluid can accumulate after an ectopic pregnancy rupture.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ectopic pregnancy is located in the ampulla, which is a part of the fallopian tube. Since the ampulla is directly connected to the uterine cavity, the fluid from the rupture will most likely flow directly into the uterine cavity due to the anatomical proximity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Uterine cavity.",D

Similarly, they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. This means that they want to detect a true difference between the two treatments with at most 90% chance of Type II error.",-,"Let's reason step by step. The statistical power refers to the probability of finding a significant difference between the two drugs when there is a real difference. Since the probability of wrongly finding no difference is 10%, the power of the study must be 100% - 10% = 90%.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with a 12-hour history of word-finding difficulty and weakness and sensory loss of the right arm and leg. He has no history of similar symptoms. Given his age, medical history, and current symptoms, it's likely that he has suffered an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a CT scan of the head without contrast.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a neurological problem, such as a seizure. Therefore, an EEG would be the most appropriate next step to diagnose the cause of the seizure. An EEG can help identify abnormal electrical activity in the brain that may be causing the seizure.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that the technician wants to determine whether CMV DNA is present in the patient's blood. This suggests that the technique used is a molecular biology method, specifically designed for detecting specific sequences of DNA. Given these clues, it is most likely that the technician used Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on this patient's blood.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Reverse transcription is a necessary step to convert RNA into cDNA before amplification. Then, PCR can be used to amplify the cDNA and detect the presence of CMV DNA. Therefore, the most likely laboratory procedure used on this patient's blood is reverse transcription followed by PCR.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 24-year-old man who was involved in a motor vehicle collision and was the unrestrained driver. He has numerous lacerations and ecchymoses over his face, which suggests that he may have suffered significant facial trauma. Furthermore, sensation to pinprick is absent over the right side of the face anterior to the right ear, extending down along the full extent of the mandible to the chin. This suggests that there may be a fracture affecting the mandible or surrounding structures. The most likely cause of these findings is a fracture affecting the mandible.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The foramen spinosum is responsible for innervating the face and tongue, so a fracture affecting this location would likely cause the observed sensory loss. Additionally, the presence of fractures in the orbit, zygomatic arch, and infratemporal fossa suggests that the fracture may have occurred as a result of blunt force trauma to the head, which could also explain the observed sensory loss.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who was stung by a bee 15 minutes prior to presenting at the emergency department. She has mild lightheadedness but no difficulty swallowing, and her vital signs are within normal limits. Given these symptoms and the fact that she was stung by a bee, it is likely that she is experiencing an allergic reaction to the bee venom. In this case, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be an epinephrine injection using an EpiPen or similar device, followed by administration of antihistamines and corticosteroids as needed.",D,"Let's reason step by step. α1-adrenergic antagonists are used to treat allergic reactions because they block the effects of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Since the patient is experiencing symptoms of an allergic reaction, α1-adrenergic antagonists would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A killed vaccine is a type of vaccine that contains inactivated or attenuated pathogens, which are unable to cause disease. The main advantage of a killed vaccine over a live vaccine is that it avoids the concern for reversion to virulence. This means that even if the vaccine is not effective in preventing infection, it will not cause the disease itself. Therefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is to avoid the concern for reversion to virulence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Killed vaccines are less likely to cause side effects than live vaccines. They are also more likely to generate mucosal immunity, which is important for protecting against respiratory infections. Therefore, the most appropriate rationale for developing a killed vaccine for this illness is that it will be less likely to cause side effects and will provide mucosal immunity.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a restrained passenger in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which suggests that the injury may be related to the deceleration forces involved in the crash. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and abdominal pain are consistent with injuries to the chest and abdomen. The decreased breath sounds on the left side and opacification of the left lower lung field on the chest x-ray suggest a possible pneumothorax or hemothorax on the left side. The greenish fluid aspirated from the chest tube is consistent with blood or bile. In light of these findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a thoracoscopy to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the patient's symptoms and the findings on the chest X-ray, it is important to assess the extent of the lung injury and the potential for a pneumothorax.

The man has a two-gene deletion, which is recessive. Therefore, all offspring will inherit at least one of the two genes with the deletion from their father. This means that 75% of the offspring will have a two-gene deletion. The remaining 25% will be carriers of the recessive allele.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old girl who was exposed to meningococcal disease through her soccer teammate, who was hospitalized with the disease. Although the patient feels well and has no symptoms of meningitis, she may still be at risk of developing the disease. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time would be to administer the meningococcal vaccine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is at risk of contracting meningitis from her teammate. Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of meningitis, so it should be prescribed to the patient immediately. Rifampin is not indicated in this case, as it is typically used to treat tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. Doxycycline is also not indicated in this case, as it is typically used to treat bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and others. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time would be to prescribe penicillin.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old boy who was found with a blank stare and flat facial expression at a party. He became hostile during the examination, which suggests that he may have ingested a drug that caused this reaction. Given his age and behavior, it's likely that he ingested a drug that is commonly used by teenagers, such as PCP (phencyclidine).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of catatonia and hostility are consistent with opioid intoxication. Oxycodone is a commonly abused opioid, so it is the most likely drug that the patient ingested. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine, which is not typically associated with catatonic symptoms. Methamphetamine is a stimulant, which would be expected to produce agitation and hyperactivity rather than catatonia. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic, which can produce a range of effects including hallucinations, delusions, and altered perception. However, it is not typically associated with catatonic symptoms.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who has been admitted to the nursing facility for 3 months. She was previously treated for congestive heart failure and is currently taking furosemide and digoxin. Her physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. The patient's symptoms are consistent with malnutrition, which is common in elderly patients, especially those with chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. Therefore, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study would be to determine the serum albumin concentration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's poor appetite and weight loss could be due to underlying lung conditions, such as pneumonia or congestive heart failure.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 47-year-old man who presents with a severe occipital headache and stiff neck, which are the primary symptoms of meningitis. However, the patient's normal temperature, pulse, and blood pressure suggest that this may not be the case. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease suggests that his headache may be related to one of these conditions rather than meningitis. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is a migraine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of severe occipital headache and stiff neck are highly suggestive of meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms such as fever, confusion, or altered mental status, which would be expected in patients with meningitis. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, but this could be related to hypertension rather than meningitis.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient was hit from behind below the right knee while playing football, which suggests that there may be an injury to the lower extremities. The gait analysis reveals a lack of fluid motion, which is consistent with an injury to the lower extremities. The standing flexion test results are negative, which suggests that there may not be any significant damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The collateral knee ligaments appear intact, and foot drop on the right is noted. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a posteriorly deviated fibular head.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The anteriorly deviated distal femur would likely result in difficulty with ankle dorsiflexion, which is necessary for normal gait. However, the patient's foot drop on the right suggests that there may be a problem with the peroneal nerve or the tibial nerve, rather than the femoral nerve. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is posteriorly deviated fibular head.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing substernal chest pain, which is exacerbated by coughing and inspiration. This suggests that the pain may be related to inflammation or irritation in the thoracic cavity. The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation in all leads, which is consistent with pericarditis. Therefore, the most likely cause of his condition is injury to the pericardium.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The location of the pain, along with the patient's history of chest pain and the ECG findings, suggests a possible aortic dissection. An aortic dissection is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, which can lead to bleeding into the surrounding tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.

D,"Let's reason step by step. During the last minute of exercise, various measurements are taken. Compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased? The answer lies in the fact that during exercise, blood vessels dilate and cardiac output increases. This means that stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped per beat) and cardiac output increase. As a result, pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures) tends to increase. Therefore, compared with the measurement before the session, which of the following is most likely to be decreased? The answer is B: Stroke volume.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With an increased heart rate, the time for ventricular filling is reduced, leading to a decrease in stroke volume. This reduction in stroke volume will lead to a decrease in pulse pressure, which is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with symptoms of odynophagia and gastroesophageal reflux, which are common symptoms of GERD. Additionally, the patient has a history of AIDS, which increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections, including oral thrush.

Given these findings, it is most likely that the patient's S3 gallop is due to impaired contractility of the left ventricle rather than mitral valve prolapse.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The post hoc analysis disclosed a small but statistically significant vaccine protection among African American subjects. This finding is based on an exploratory analysis, which may be prone to false positives due to multiple testing. Therefore, the most accurate rationale for questioning the validity of efficacy analysis of the HIV vaccine among the African American study subjects is that the finding may be a Type I error due to multiple testing.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since HIV infection is more prevalent among African American populations, it is likely that the vaccine would have a greater impact on this group, leading to a statistically significant protection among African American subjects.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 14-year-old girl who has been engaging in sexual intercourse with various partners for the past month without using condoms or other contraception. She also smokes cigarettes, disobeys her curfew, and is truant from school. This behavior suggests that she may be acting out due to underlying emotional distress. The most likely defense mechanism being used by this patient is acting out.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient uses other behaviors to displace her attention from her negative feelings about her parents' separation. She is acting out, which is a defense mechanism that involves expressing unacceptable impulses or desires in a socially acceptable way.

Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Given this information, we can conclude that the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a Trinucleotide repeat expansion.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Frameshift mutations are a type of genetic mutation that can cause developmental delays and other problems. These mutations result in the insertion or deletion of nucleotides in the DNA sequence, altering the reading frame of the gene and leading to a non-functional protein. In this case, the patient's symptoms, including developmental delay, irritability, and hand flapping, are consistent with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given the patient's family history of learning difficulties and cognitive disabilities, it is also possible that the patient may have an underlying genetic condition that contributes to his development delays. Therefore, further evaluation and testing would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of smoking and has been diagnosed with a large right lower lobe mass on CT scan. Given the location and size of the mass, it is likely to be a primary lung cancer rather than a metastatic tumor from another site.

The x-ray shows an air-fluid level in the left side of the chest, partial collapse of the left lung, and elevation of the stomach bubble. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hemopneumothorax, not under tension. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is option A: Hemopneumothorax, not under tension.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of air in the chest suggests a pneumothorax. The patient also has blood in the chest cavity, which means it is a hemopneumothorax. However, the mediastinum is in the midline, which means there is no tension.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 16-month-old girl who was brought to the emergency department because of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that began 25 minutes ago and has continued despite administration of 0.5 mg/kg rectal diazepam 10 minutes ago. The patient's oxygen saturation drops to 75% within 2 minutes after intubation, which suggests that there may be an underlying respiratory problem. Given the patient's age, medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no medications, it is unlikely that encephalitis or meningitis are the underlying causes of her respiratory insufficiency. Medication-induced suppression of central respiratory drive is also unlikely given the short duration of the seizure and the fact that diazepam was administered 10 minutes prior to intubation. Therefore, airway occlusion is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a fever and experienced a seizure, which suggests an infection. The oxygen saturation is low and the patient appears cyanotic, which are common symptoms of encephalitis. Additionally, the patient's respiratory rate is shallow and rapid, which is consistent with respiratory failure due to encephalitis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's respiratory insufficiency is encephalitis.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of systemic sclerosis, which is an autoimmune disease that can cause fibrosis and inflammation in various organs, including the lungs. The patient's symptoms, such as progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, are consistent with lung involvement in systemic sclerosis. The patient's pulmonary function tests show reduced total lung capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, which is consistent with interstitial lung disease. Therefore, the most likely finding on histologic examination of a lung biopsy specimen would be diffuse interstitial fibrosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has scleroderma, which increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension and thromboembolism. She also has shortness of breath and a cough, which are symptoms of a pulmonary embolism.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with severe neck pain, rated as a 7 out of 10. He denies any trauma but reports that he had been doing a lot of painting over the past week. This suggests that the patient may have developed strain or inflammation in his neck muscles due to repetitive motion. The physician's treatment plan, which included articulatory springing technique, may have exacerbated this condition, leading to further pain and discomfort. Therefore, the physician may be found liable if the patient suffered any permanent damage as a result of their treatment.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient had neck pain and was treated with articulatory springing technique. The fact that the patient had osteoarthritis of the cervical spine indicates that the treatment caused the complications, as it could have exacerbated the underlying condition.

However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a typical adenoviral infection. Therefore, it is more likely that the infectious agent has a double-stranded nucleic acid genome, which is characteristic of RNA viruses such as coronaviruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of recurrent infections, including osteomyelitis and pneumonia. He also has an abnormality in his neutrophils, specifically failure of the neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus. This suggests that the patient's neutrophils are unable to effectively kill intracellular microorganisms such as S. aureus. Therefore, the most likely answer is D: Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a problem with the movement of leukocytes. We know that the movement of leukocytes occurs via a process called rolling, which involves the interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells. The patient's failure to undergo an oxidative burst when exposed to S. aureus suggests that there is a problem with the function of neutrophils. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's increased susceptibility to infection is option D: Inability of leukocytes to kill intracellular microorganisms.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a sore throat, fever, and white exudate on the right tonsil. These symptoms are consistent with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat. Given the severity of the symptoms and the presence of an exudate, incision and drainage is not sufficient to treat this condition. Therefore, the most appropriate management would be antibiotic therapy, which would help to eliminate the bacterial infection.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has a peritonsillar abscess, which means that the treatment should be similar to the treatment of retropharyngeal abscess. Therefore, we should use intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. This will help to reduce the swelling and inflammation in the affected area.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with symptoms of pheochromocytoma, which is a rare tumor that arises from the adrenal medulla. The tumor produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, sweating, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. Given these symptoms, it is likely that the patient has a pheochromocytoma. To confirm this diagnosis, we would need to perform additional tests, such as a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines or an MRI scan of the adrenal glands. However, based on the symptoms presented, it is likely that the patient has a pheochromocytoma.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that a left adrenal mass could be a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor that secretes norepinephrine and epinephrine. This means that there will be an increase in sodium levels in the urine. Therefore, measuring vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in the urine would not be helpful in establishing this patient's diagnosis. On the other hand, measuring cortisol levels in the urine would not be specific enough to confirm the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Therefore, the most helpful urinary assay in establishing this patient's diagnosis would be measuring sodium levels in the urine.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling in the right knee, without any history of injury. The examination reveals warmth, erythema, and effusion in the affected joint, along with exquisite tenderness on minimal range-of-motion testing. The synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Based on these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in the affected joint.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has a history of osteoarthritis. Ammonium urate crystals are often associated with gout, which can cause pain and swelling in the joints. Therefore, it is likely that the crystals found in the synovial fluid are ammonium urate. The other options do not match the symptoms described.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old man who has been drinking eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily, which is likely exacerbating his underlying cirrhosis and ascites. He presents with nausea, light-headedness, and vomiting of bright red blood, which suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Given the severity of his symptoms and the risk of further bleeding, the most appropriate immediate management would be endotracheal intubation to secure his airway and prevent aspiration of blood or other debris.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the patient has esophageal varices and is bleeding. The most appropriate immediate management for this patient is transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting, which will reduce the pressure in the portal vein and stop the bleeding. This procedure should be performed as soon as possible to minimize further bleeding and potential complications.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding for the past year. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her physical examination shows normal vital signs, and her pelvic examination reveals a normal-sized uterus and ovaries that cannot be palpated. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform an endometrial biopsy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age and history of abnormal bleeding suggest the possibility of cervical cancer. Therefore, the next step should be a colposcopy to examine the cervix for any abnormalities. This is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine is a medication that can affect various pharmacokinetic processes, including absorption, distribution, excretion, and metabolism. Given the patient's family history of osteoporosis, it is likely that the physician is concerned about the potential impact of carbamazepine on vitamin D levels or bone health. Therefore, the most likely reason for this recommendation is that carbamazepine may affect vitamin D metabolism, which could potentially lead to decreased vitamin D levels and increased risk of osteoporosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbamazepine is known to cause osteoporosis, which can be worsened by low Vitamin D levels. Therefore, it is likely that the physician is recommending Vitamin D to counter the negative effects of carbamazepine on absorption. The most likely pharmacokinetic process affected by carbamazepine is therefore absorption.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young female with a history of unprotected sexual intercourse, which puts her at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The patient's symptoms include lower abdominal pain and fever, which are consistent with STI symptoms. Given the patient's risk factors and symptoms, it is likely that she has an STI. The most common STIs in young women are Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Treponema pallidum. Therefore, the patient should be treated with antimicrobial chemotherapy to provide treatment for these potential infections.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and cervical mucus, are consistent with syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. Therefore, antimicrobial chemotherapy should target this specific bacterium. The most appropriate answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is asking to disclose his diagnosis only to certain individuals, and not to others. This raises concerns about confidentiality and the potential consequences of disclosure. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: His probation officer. As a condition of his probation, the patient has an obligation to report any changes in his medical status to his probation officer. Therefore, it would be reasonable for the patient's diagnosis to be disclosed to his probation officer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's wife is the one covering the insurance and is therefore entitled to know the diagnosis and treatment plan since she is responsible for the payment. On the other hand, the patient does not want his diagnosis disclosed to anyone else, including his probation officer, Cocaine Anonymous sponsor, or even the insurance company. Therefore, the only person who should be informed of the patient'’s diagnosis is his wife.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The child is experiencing an allergic reaction after consuming an egg, which suggests that the child has an allergy to eggs. Given this information, it's likely that the child will have a hypersensitivity reaction to any vaccine that contains egg proteins as a stabilizer or adjuvant. Therefore, the potential risk for hypersensitivity reaction posed by vaccination against Pertussis is high.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hypersensitivity reactions are related to the liver and can be caused by vaccines that contain antigens from the liver, like the hepatitis vaccine. The symptoms described in the question, such as urticaria, swelling of the lips, and difficulty breathing, are consistent with a severe allergic reaction. Therefore, it is likely that the child had an adverse reaction to the hepatitis vaccine.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 5-year-old girl who has been experiencing recurrent injuries, particularly in her joints. She also has a family history of joint hypermobility and other musculoskeletal disorders. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), which is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissue. The patient's symptoms are consistent with EDS, particularly her joint hypermobility, recurrent injuries, and family history of similar conditions. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform a skeletal survey to assess for any other signs of EDS or other musculoskeletal disorders.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of recurrent injuries, joint hypermobility, and family history of connective tissue disorders is suggestive of a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In this case, a bone scan would be the most appropriate next step to assess for any underlying bone abnormalities. Additionally, an echocardiography may also be considered to evaluate for any cardiac involvement.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of chronic recurrent otitis media, which is an infection of the middle ear. He recently completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for this condition. The examination shows clear ear canals and intact tympanic membranes, but a brown, irregular mass is visualized behind the tympanic membrane. This suggests that there may be a foreign body or a tumor in the middle ear. Given the patient's history of chronic recurrent otitis media and the presence of a mass in the middle ear, the most likely explanation for these findings is that the mass is a cholesteatoma, which is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the middle ear as a complication of chronic otitis media.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Midface hypoplasia is a condition that affects the development of the facial bones, which can cause a number of problems including difficulty breathing and eating. The findings in this case are consistent with midface hypoplasia, as the mass behind the tympanic membrane is likely a result of the underdeveloped facial bones. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is midface hypoplasia.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 7-month-old infant who was recently discharged from the hospital following an episode of enteritis and dehydration. He has persistent watery diarrhea, which suggests that his gut is still recovering from the previous infection. Given this information, it's likely that the problem is related to the patient's gut health rather than any other underlying condition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fructose intolerance is a condition where the body cannot properly digest fructose, which can lead to watery diarrhea. The patient's symptoms are consistent with fructose intolerance, as he is experiencing watery diarrhea and has been consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables. Therefore, the most likely answer is A: Fructose intolerance.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is scheduled for adrenalectomy, which suggests that the patient has a condition related to the adrenal glands. Given the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of an incidental left adrenal mass on CT scan, it is likely that the patient has primary aldosteronism (Conn' syndrome). In this case, treatment with spironolactone or eplerenone would be appropriate. However, since the patient is scheduled for adrenalectomy, it is more likely that the patient has a non-functioning adrenal mass, such as an adenoma or a carcinoma. In this case, treatment with phenoxybenzamine would be appropriate to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crisis during surgery.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's elevated blood pressure and history of a right flank mass suggest that he may have a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that can cause hypertension. In this case, a loading dose of potassium chloride would be indicated to help prevent hypokalemia, which can be a complication of pheochromocytoma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: A loading dose of potassium chloride.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of acupuncture in children with chronic headaches. This suggests that the study is an intervention trial, where a treatment (acupuncture) is being tested on a group of participants (children with chronic headaches). Therefore, the best answer is B: Case series.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A case-control study is a type of observational study that compares a group of patients with a particular condition (cases) to a group of patients without the condition (controls). This design is appropriate for investigating the risk factors for a disease. The study described in the question is a case-control study, as it compares a group of children with chronic headaches to a control group of children without chronic headaches. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Case-control.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 78-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. She has undergone several surgeries in the past, including a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Given her history of multiple surgeries and her current condition, it is essential to consider her suitability for home dialysis. This option would allow her to receive treatment in the comfort of her own home, which could be beneficial given her advanced age and medical conditions. Therefore, considering long-term treatment options for this patient, the most appropriate factor to consider is her suitability for home dialysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of an abdominal operation, specifically a cholecystectomy, is likely the most relevant factor to consider in long-term treatment options as it may indicate potential complications or limitations related to the surgery. Additionally, considering her suitability for home dialysis would also be important, but this is not directly related to the patient'’s history of an abdominal operation.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, which is associated with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with hypocalcemia, which is often seen in patients with malabsorption syndromes. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is vitamin D deficiency.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cramping, numbness, and tingling are consistent with hypomagnesemia, a condition characterized by low magnesium levels in the blood. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic alcoholism, which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients including magnesium, further supports this diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's laboratory results showing a serum calcium concentration of 6.5 mg/dL, which is within the normal range, also does not support hypoparathyroidism or osteomalacia as possible diagnoses. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is hypomagnesemia.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, which suggests that he may have underlying coronary artery disease. Additionally, the patient is a heavy smoker, which further increases his risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Given these factors, it is likely that the patient's symptoms are related to his underlying coronary artery disease. Therefore, treatment with a \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agent would be most likely to improve his symptoms by reducing the workload on his heart and decreasing his blood pressure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. β-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol, are known to cause peripheral vasodilation, which can reduce afterload and improve symptoms of angina. Additionally, these medications can also decrease heart rate and blood pressure, which can further contribute to improved symptoms. Therefore, the most likely mechanism by which a β- adrenergic blocking agent would improve this patient's symptoms is through peripheral vasodilation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of constipation, which could be related to her current symptoms. However, she also has abdominal tenderness and guarding in the left lower quadrant, which suggests that there may be an inflammatory process or abscess in this area. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a test for Clostridium difficile toxin, as this is a common cause of colitis and diarrhea.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of antibiotic use and symptoms of abdominal cramps and fever suggest a potential Clostridium difficile infection, which is commonly associated with antibiotic use. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to test the stool for Clostridium difficile toxin.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of smoking and emphysema, which suggests that he may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, the patient's symptoms, such as dry eyes and mouth, are consistent with COPD. Furthermore, the patient's x-ray shows hyperinflation of the chest and a mass in the right hilum, which is also consistent with COPD. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient has COPD, which is causing his neurologic findings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of leg weakness and difficulty rising from a chair are consistent with a muscle membrane disorder, such as myopathy, which can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and emphysema may also contribute to his respiratory problems. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a muscle membrane disorder, specifically myopathy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is HIV positive and has not disclosed this information to his wife. The physician is recommending that the patient inform his wife of his condition because her right to know is paramount. This is an example of beneficence, where the physician is prioritizing the well-being and autonomy of the patient's wife over the patient's desire for secrecy. Therefore, option C: 'beneficence overrides autonomy' best describes the rationale for the physician's recommendation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's recommendation is based on beneficence, which means that the patient should disclose his HIV status to his wife because it would benefit her by allowing her to take necessary precautions. This decision prioritizes the well-being and safety of the wife over the patient's autonomy to keep his condition private.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 4-year-old boy who was found unconscious in his yard after playing outside all afternoon. He had been feeling well lately with no recent acute exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. On arrival, he responds to pain but speech is incoherent. His temperature is 41.2°C (106.2°F), pulse is 148/minute, respirations are 36/minute and shallow, and blood pressure is 88/46 mm Hg. His skin is hot and dry. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Muscle tone is poor; deep tendon reflexes are diminished throughout. Neurologic examination shows no focal abnormalities. Given these findings, the most likely underlying mechanism for these findings is...",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, suggesting there is no active infection. Given his history of cystic fibrosis, the most likely cause for his current condition is related to the underlying disease and its impact on his body's ability to regulate temperature. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism for these findings is impaired sweat gland function with reduced ability to regulate heat loss.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. When the efferent arteriole is constricted with a vascular clamp, it increases the resistance to blood flow in the glomerulus. This increased resistance causes the glomerular capillary pressure (Pc) to increase. As a result, the Starling forces that drive filtration in the glomerulus are altered. Specifically, the increased Pc and decreased oncotic pressure (πo) due to constriction of the efferent arteriole would lead to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary wall. This increased pressure gradient would result in a decrease in the filtration coefficient (Kf). Therefore, the correct answer is A: Decreased filtration coefficient (Kf).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the efferent arteriole is constricted, there will be less blood flow out of the glomerulus, which means there will be less protein leaving the glomerulus. This will cause a decrease in oncotic pressure. As a result, Starling forces will shift towards increased filtration coefficient (Kf) to compensate for the decreased oncotic pressure.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of intermittent nausea and abdominal pain that occurs 20 to 30 minutes after eating. The pain extends from the epigastrium to the right upper quadrant and is sometimes felt in the right scapula; it lasts about 30 minutes and is not relieved by antacids. The patient has no vomiting, and she is currently asymptomatic. Given this information, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an abdominal ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (A). This test can help identify any gallstones or other abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including nausea, abdominal pain, and right upper quadrant involvement, suggest a potential issue with the gallbladder. A CT scan would be the most appropriate next step to visualize the gallbladder and identify any possible gallstones. This would help guide further management decisions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of breast cancer that has recurred twice in the past 5 years. She has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy for metastatic carcinoma to the bone. Given this complex medical history, it is likely that the patient's back pain is related to her underlying condition rather than a primary musculoskeletal issue. Therefore, the most appropriate osteopathic manipulative technique to treat this patient'\'s spine would be indirect myofascial release (Option B). This technique is gentle and non-invasive, making it suitable for patients with complex medical histories like this patient.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of cancer and has undergone both radiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, we would need to use a technique that is gentle and does not cause any further damage to the tissues. High velocity, low amplitude techniques are typically used for patients with acute injuries, so it's the most appropriate choice. In this case, the most appropriate answer is high velocity, low amplitude.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 32-year-old man who works as a jackhammer operator, which suggests that his symptoms are related to his occupation. The symptoms of pain and swelling in the right arm for 3 days suggest that there may be an injury or inflammation in the affected area. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein (Option C).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and erythema are consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis, which is a common condition affecting superficial veins. The fact that the symptoms are exacerbated by exertion also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C: Superficial thrombophlebitis of the basilic vein.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of osteoporosis and taking alendronate and calcium supplementation. She has been experiencing fatigue, diffuse muscle aches, and generalized pain for the past year. Given her age, medical history, and symptoms, it's likely that she has a musculoskeletal disorder or a degenerative joint disease. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in evaluation would be to order an MRI of the cervical spine to rule out any spinal cord compression or other structural abnormalities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, muscle aches, and generalized pain could be attributed to cervical spine issues, such as cervical spondylosis, which can cause similar symptoms. Additionally, the patient's history of osteoporosis and use of alendronate may also contribute to these symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in evaluation would be to order an MRI of the cervical spine to further assess for any structural abnormalities that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue, which are common symptoms of fibromyalgia. Additionally, the physical examination reveals multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups, which is a characteristic feature of fibromyalgia. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is fibromyalgia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of chronic achiness, stiffness, and fatigue, along with the normal radiograph findings, suggest osteoarthritis, a condition characterized by joint degeneration. However, the presence of multiple bilateral tender points in the trapezius, gluteal, and suboccipital muscle groups suggests fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain. Therefore, considering both conditions, the most likely diagnosis is fibromyalgia.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young woman with a history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. She has no other medical conditions or symptoms that would suggest an underlying organic cause for her symptoms. Given the chronic nature of her symptoms and the lack of any other obvious causes, it is likely that her symptoms are related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements. The diagnosis of IBS is based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings. There is no laboratory test or imaging study that can definitively diagnose IBS. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a medication that targets the symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis, which can be treated with mesalamine. However, the patient does not have a history of diarrhea or rectal bleeding, which would suggest a more severe form of inflammatory bowel disease that may require more aggressive treatment with infliximab or azathioprine. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is mesalamine.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing symptoms of depression, including fatigue, loss of interest in usual activities, and insomnia. He also reports hearing voices at night telling him he has sinned. Given the severity of his depressive symptoms and the presence of psychotic features, a combination treatment approach with an antidepressant and an antipsychotic medication would be most appropriate. In this case, the best treatment option would be to add fluoxetine (Prozac) to the patient's current regimen of olanzapine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, loss of interest, weight loss, and insomnia are consistent with bipolar disorder, which can be effectively treated with divalproex.

Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient would be divalproex.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with a 4-day history of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are all symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) upset. Additionally, the patient has been confused and agitated during this period, which could be related to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances caused by the GI upset. Furthermore, the patient's temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are all within normal limits, which suggests that the patient is not in a state of severe shock. Therefore, based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is distributive shock, which is characterized by decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, and hypotension, along with the low oxygen saturation, are consistent with cardiogenic shock, which is caused by a failure of the heart to pump effectively.

There is clear fluid behind the left tympanic membrane, enlarged tonsils bilaterally, and pain with tapping of the left upper incisors. Left frontal sinus does not transilluminate. Cardiopulmonary examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's sinusitis?",-,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of nasal stuffiness, clear rhinorrhea, and ear fullness are consistent with Eustachian tube dysfunction, which can be caused by inflammation or blockage of the Eustachian tube. Additionally, the patient's use of oral contraceptives may also contribute to her sinusitis. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient'’s sinusitis is Eustachian tube dysfunction.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She also has thick nasal secretions, salty sweat that crystallizes on her skin, and epigastric tenderness. These symptoms are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. This is a known mutation associated with CF. Therefore, it is likely that this patient has cystic fibrosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of thick nasal secretions, salty sweat, and pancreatic insufficiency are consistent with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. The patient has a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene, which is associated with mild to moderate disease. Therefore, the best explanation for this patient' s clinical phenotype is that she has cystic fibrosis due to her G551D mutation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is in shock, with a pulse of 130/minute and blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg. He has jugular venous distention, which suggests that there is increased central venous pressure. Given the severity of his condition, it would be reasonable to prioritize further evaluation and management over chest x-ray at this point.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased blood pressure are consistent with a bronchial injury, which can cause similar symptoms and require bronchoscopy for evaluation. However, the patient also has jugular venous distension, which suggests cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform pericardiocentesis to drain the pericardial fluid and relieve the cardiac tamponade.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is suing for malpractice, alleging that the sponge was left in her pelvis due to negligence. The concept invoked here is res ipsa loquitur, which means 'the thing speaks for itself.' This doctrine holds that if a patient suffers an injury during medical treatment and it is not the result of any voluntary act or omission on the part of the patient, then the doctor is presumed to have been negligent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's case involves proximate cause, which refers to the direct and immediate cause of the injury, in this case, the surgical sponge left in her pelvis. This concept is often used in medical malpractice cases to establish liability.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a red, itchy rash on his buttocks and legs, which is consistent with an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. Given the patient's recent cruise to the Caribbean, where he swam in the ship's pool and used the hot tub, it is likely that the infectious agent causing this rash began to proliferate in the warm water of the pool or hot tub.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of a red, itchy rash are consistent with eccrine gland involvement, as eccrine glands are the most common type of sweat gland and are responsible for sweating. Additionally, the fact that the patient swam in the ship's pool and used the hot tub suggests that the infectious agent may have been introduced through contaminated water or equipment. Therefore, it is likely that the infectious agent began to proliferate in the eccrine glands.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. She has a normal Pap smear 3 months ago and saw her ophthalmologist 6 months ago. Her grandmother has breast cancer, which increases the risk of breast cancer in this patient. Therefore, it is recommended that she undergo mammography every year starting at age 25 to detect any potential breast cancer early.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's family history of breast cancer suggests a possible increased risk of breast cancer, and human papillomavirus testing is recommended for women with a family history of cervical cancer, as HPV is associated with cervical cancer. However, the patient has already had a normal Pap smear 3 months ago, so it's not necessary to repeat the test at this time. Mammography is also recommended for women with a family history of breast cancer, but since the patient' s grandmother has breast cancer, mammography would be a good recommendation at this time.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a sexually active young woman who has had fever, chills, malaise, and pain of the vulva for 2 days. Examination shows a vulvar pustule that has ulcerated and formed multiple satellite lesions. Nodes are palpated in the inguinal and femoral areas. A smear of fluid from the lesions establishes the diagnosis. Given these symptoms and physical examination findings, it is likely that the patient has chancroid, which is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. This bacterium is typically spread through sexual contact.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of vulvar lesions, inguinal lymphadenitis, and fever are consistent with gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Additionally, the presence of multiple satellite lesions around the primary lesion is also consistent with gonorrhea. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Neisseria gonorrhoeae.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old woman with AIDS, who has been receiving triple antiretroviral therapy. She has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 400/ mm3, which is within the normal range. Given her symptoms and medical history, it is likely that she has an opportunistic infection caused by one of the organisms listed in the options. The most likely causal organism based on the patient's symptoms and medical history is Cryptosporidium parvum.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, weight loss, and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count are consistent with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Additionally, the patient's travel history to Asia may have increased her risk of exposure to this pathogen.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patients are migrant workers, and the outbreak is characterized by fever, chills, tachypnea, sore throat, swollen glands, and severe malaise. One patient dies from respiratory complications, and another dies from myocardial involvement. A gram-positive rod is isolated from the respiratory tracts of 7 of the patients. Given these symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that the outbreak is caused by a bacterial infection rather than a viral or fungal infection. The most likely cause of the outbreak is",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, and swollen glands, which are all consistent with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. Additionally, the fact that one patient died from respiratory complications and another died from myocardial involvement suggests that this outbreak is likely caused by a viral infection, such as Epstein-Barr virus.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a 3-day history of worsening fever and headache, which is concerning for meningitis. The lumbar puncture reveals a protein level of 89 mg/dL (reference range: 15-45 mg/dL) with pleocytosis, which further supports the diagnosis of meningitis. Given these findings, the most likely etiologic organism is",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms and elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid suggest a bacterial meningitis, and Haemophilus influenzae is a common cause of this condition. Therefore, the most likely etiologic organism is Haemophilus influenzae.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 25-year-old man with Down syndrome and mild mental retardation. He has a systolic murmur and also underwent surgical repair of an atrial septal defect at 1 year of age. He smokes one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years, which significantly increases his risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. The patient is currently living in a group home and working part-time in a fast-food restaurant. He has a few friends and is romantically involved with a woman from his church group. Given these circumstances, the most appropriate initial recommendation would be to advise the parents not to influence their son's decision in this matter.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's Down syndrome and mild mental retardation raise concerns about his competency to make decisions regarding his health and lifestyle. Additionally, his smoking habit and lack of exercise increase his risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. Given these factors, it is reasonable to recommend that the parents be granted legal guardianship over their son.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a prepubescent girl with Turner syndrome, which is a chromosomal disorder that affects the development of female reproductive organs. Given her condition, it's unlikely she will be able to carry a pregnancy to term. Therefore, if she wishes to have a family, she will need to consider alternative options such as adoption or using assisted reproductive technology (ART) with an egg donor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's Turner syndrome raises concerns about her ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy, so genetic counseling is the most appropriate next step. This will help the patient understand her reproductive options and make informed decisions about her future.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is an 87-year-old woman with progressive memory loss over the past 2 years. She has a history of vulvar cancer treated with wide excision 10 years ago. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and her laboratory studies are all within normal limits. Given this information, it seems that the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a cholinesterase inhibitor, such as donepezil.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of memory loss and tremors suggest a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease, and dopamine agonists are commonly used to treat this condition. However, the patient also has mild systolic hypertension, which may require treatment with a beta-adrenergic agonist or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a dopamine agonist, such as ropinirole or pramipexole, to treat their Parkinson's disease symptoms, and a beta-adrenergic agonist, such as albuterol, to help manage their mild systolic hypertension.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 9-year-old boy who has recently immigrated to the United States with his family. He has not been evaluated by a physician in 4 years, which suggests that he may have underlying medical conditions that need attention. His physical examination reveals mild cardiomegaly and left ventricular prominence on chest xray, as well as a grade 3/6 systolic murmur audible along the left sternal border at the third and fourth intercostal spaces. These findings suggest that this patient is at greatest risk for developing tricuspid valve regurgitation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's heart murmur and weak femoral pulses suggest a problem with the heart's electrical system, which could lead to atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the patient' s mild cardiomegaly and left ventricular prominence on chest xray suggest that the patient may be at risk for cor pulmonale or tricuspid valve regurgitation due to increased pressure in the right side of the heart. However, based on the information provided, the most likely complication is atrial fibrillation.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is pregnant and her father had classic hemophilia. This means that the patient's father was a carrier of the disease, which is an X-linked recessive disorder. Since the patient's father was a carrier, there is a chance that the patient herself is a carrier. However, since the patient is pregnant and has undergone amniocentesis, we have obtained a karyotype from the amniotic fluid sample. The karyotype shows that the fetus is XY, which means that the fetus does not have hemophilia. Therefore, the patient's infant will neither have hemophilia nor be a carrier of the disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hemophilia is a recessive X-linked trait, so the mother, who is a carrier, has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to her son, and the infant will not have hemophilia or be a carrier. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of increased anxiety, abdominal discomfort, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. She also reports being robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot 3 weeks ago. This suggests that she may be experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Additionally, her symptoms are not specific to any particular type of anxiety disorder, making PTSD the most likely diagnosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's anxiety, fear, and avoidance of certain situations suggest agoraphobia, a common anxiety disorder. Additionally, the patient's history of being robbed at knifepoint in a parking lot may have contributed to her development of agoraphobia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is agoraphobia.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about contraindications for DtaP immunization. The parents should be questioned regarding any allergy to eggs, as egg-based vaccines are used in the DtaP vaccine. Therefore, the correct answer is A: allergy to eggs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. DtaP immunization is a common vaccine that contains egg proteins, so it is important to ask about egg allergies before administering the vaccine. The other options are not relevant to this scenario.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The physician is reporting for a shift in the emergency department and appears tired and more disheveled than usual. There is an odor of alcohol on his breath, which suggests that he may be intoxicated. As a responsible healthcare provider, it is our duty to ensure that all medical professionals are fit for duty and able to provide safe and effective care to patients. In this case, the physician's behavior and appearance suggest that he may not be fit for duty, and therefore, it is necessary to take action to ensure patient safety.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The physician's fatigue and disheveled appearance could be due to a long shift or personal stress, and it is important to allow him to rest and recover. However, the faint odor of alcohol on his breath raises concerns about potential impairment. In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to explain to the physician that you suspect he may be impaired due to alcohol consumption and ask him to submit to a blood sample to check his blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This is because the physician' s judgment and decision-making abilities are critical in medical settings, and any impairment due to substance use could compromise patient safety.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of kidney transplantation and is currently taking cyclosporine and corticosteroids. He presents with malaise, muscle and joint pain, and temperatures to 38.4°C (101.1°F) for 3 days. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Given this information, it is likely that the patient has a viral infection, possibly caused by BK virus or JC virus. The most appropriate next step in management would be to begin antiviral therapy with ganciclovir.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's elevated creatinine level and intracellular inclusion bodies suggest kidney transplant rejection, and increasing the dosage of corticosteroids is a common treatment for this condition. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to increase the dosage of corticosteroids.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 24-year-old woman with several small, smooth, slightly irregular, mobile, mildly tender lymph nodes palpable in her left groin just below the inguinal ligament. Given the location and characteristics of these lymph nodes, it is most likely that they are reactive to an infection or inflammation in the lower abdomen or pelvis. Therefore, the most likely source of this lymphadenopathy will be found in the lower abdomen.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The lymph nodes in the groin are typically associated with bone marrow involvement, so this is the most likely source of the lymphadenopathy. Additionally, the patient's BMI is 28 kg/m2, which is classified as overweight, and may also be a contributing factor to the development of lymphadenopathy.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The medical student is attracted to the former patient and would like to date her. However, as a healthcare provider, he has a professional responsibility to maintain boundaries with patients. In this case, the patient was under his care during her hospitalization for major depressive disorder. Although she is no longer his patient, it's still important to consider the potential power imbalance in their relationship and the potential impact on his professional judgment and behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient' invitation would be to decline the invitation due to the potential conflict of interest and the importance of maintaining professional boundaries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ethical guidelines for physician-patient relationships state that physicians should avoid dating their former patients, even if a significant amount of time has passed since the patient-physician relationship ended. This is because the power imbalance between a physician and their patient can create an exploitative situation, even if the patient is no longer receiving medical care from the physician. Therefore, the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation would be to decline the invitation and maintain a professional distance from the patient.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a gravida 2, para 1 at 12 weeks' gestation. She has no symptoms and her temperature is normal. Her blood pressure is also normal. The urinalysis shows WBCs and rare gram-negative rods. This suggests that the patient may have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB). ASB is a common condition in pregnant women, especially during the second trimester. It is usually treated with antibiotics, but it does not necessarily require treatment if the patient remains asymptomatic. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to recommend oral metronidazole therapy for 7-10 days.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's urinary tract infection requires aggressive treatment with intravenous antibiotics to prevent complications. Oral amoxicillin or metronidazole may not be sufficient for this case, and oral cranberry juice is not a recommended treatment for UTIs. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to start intravenous cefazolin therapy.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a bloody nose that has been dripping out his nares for the past 2 hours. He denies any trauma, recent upper respiratory illness, or history of prior bloody nose. Past medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. Examination of the nasal passages reveals that the site of the bleeding is on the septal mucosa of the right naris. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management includes",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's nosebleed is a serious condition that requires immediate intervention, such as catheter balloon tamponade to stop the bleeding. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg suggests hypertension, which may be contributing to the nosebleed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management includes catheter balloon tamponade and further evaluation for hypertension.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has undergone a cholecystectomy and is unable to eat 6 days after surgery. This suggests that the patient may have developed complications related to the surgery, such as ileus or obstruction. In this case, the most appropriate form of nutritional support would be feeding through a nasogastric feeding tube (option B).",B,Let's reason step by step. The patient's inability to eat after surgery suggests a severe condition that requires central hyperalimentation to provide adequate nutrition. This is the most appropriate form of nutritional support for this patient.,A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a fracture of the superior pubic ramus, which is a significant injury that can cause bleeding and swelling in the pelvis. Given this injury, it's likely that there will be bleeding into the perineum, which is the area between the scrotum and anus. This bleeding would put pressure on the urethra, causing it to become compressed and potentially leading to a disruption of the urethral lining. Therefore, the portion of the urethra at greatest risk for injury in this patient is the membranous urethra.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The intramural (pre-prostatic) portion of the urethra is located within the prostate gland and is therefore at greatest risk for injury in this patient. This is because the patient has a fracture of the superior pubic ramus, which could cause the prostate gland to be displaced or compressed, potentially leading to damage to the intramural  (pre-prostatic) portion of the urethra.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections, daily purulent sputum, and decreased exercise tolerance. He also has scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1: FVC ratio. Given these symptoms and test results, it is likely that the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The most likely test to confirm this diagnosis would be a bronchodilator challenge test.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of frequent respiratory infections, decreased exercise tolerance, and wheezing suggest a respiratory condition that requires arterial blood gas analysis to assess oxygen levels. Additionally, the patient's low sperm count may be related to his respiratory condition, which would require further evaluation.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of smoking and type 2 diabetes, which are both risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient's symptoms, including deep burning pain in the ball of his right foot and big toe when the foot is raised above chest concentration, as well as cramping in his right calf when he walks more than 50 feet, are consistent with PAD. Additionally, the patient's absent pedal pulses suggest that there may be significant stenosis or occlusion of the arteries in the lower extremities. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is aortoiliac stenosis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of pain and cramping in the legs suggest vasculitis, a condition that affects the blood vessels and can cause inflammation and damage. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking for 30 years increases his risk of developing vasculitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is vasculitis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is presenting with widespread blister formation, which is most numerous in the flexural areas including the axillae and groin. This suggests that the blisters are likely to be caused by friction or pressure rather than an allergic reaction. Furthermore, the fact that the blisters do not break easily suggests that they may be caused by adhesion failure involving a layer of skin that is resistant to tearing. Based on these observations, it is most likely that the blisters are the result of adhesion failure involving the basement membrane.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The blisters are located in the flexural areas, which are areas where the skin is more prone to friction and shearing forces, suggesting a problem with the dermal papillae. Additionally, the fact that the blisters do not break easily suggests that there may be an issue with the basement membrane. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: Dermal papillae.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 36-year-old female advertising executive with a family history of early coronary artery disease (CAD). She has never had chest pain, but she smokes one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. This is a significant risk factor for CAD. Therefore, institution of a smoking cessation program is the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The high stress lifestyle, coupled with lack of physical activity and the consumption of fast food, leads to high cholesterol levels. Therefore, the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient would be to reduce stress levels by using a biofeedback-based stress reduction program. This will help to reduce cortisol levels, which are associated with increased blood pressure, heart rate, and triglyceride levels.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 27-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department because of increasing confusion for 10 hours. He is unable to answer questions and has psychomotor agitation alternating with lethargy. His leukocyte count is 15,600/ mm3 , and serum creatine kinase activity is 943 U/L. These symptoms are consistent with a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in patients who have been treated with antipsychotic medications. The patient's history of excessive drinking and illicit drug use may also contribute to his current condition. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient'’s symptoms is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Amphetamines are stimulants that can cause agitation, confusion, and other symptoms similar to those described in the case. Since the patient has a history of drug use, amphetamine intoxication is the most likely explanation for his symptoms. The other options do not fit with the patient's symptoms and medical history.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of Marfan syndrome, which is associated with a high risk of aortic dissection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are consistent with aortic dissection, including severe substernal chest pain and tearing in quality. Furthermore, the patient's recent episode of similar but less severe chest pain suggests that he may have had a previous episode of aortic dissection. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms is aortic dissection.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of Marfan syndrome and the presence of severe chest pain suggest acute bacterial endocarditis, which is a common complication of this syndrome. Additionally, the patient'’s description of tearing chest pain that radiates to the neck suggests an acute coronary syndrome, such as an acute myocardial infarction. However, given the patient's history of Marfan syndrome and the presence of severe chest pain, I believe the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms is acute bacterial endocarditis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with sudden-onset swelling of the right knee. He denies any trauma. Past medical history reveals easy bruising and bleeding from the gums over the past month. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has a bleeding disorder. Among the options provided, the most likely explanation for these findings is diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of easy bruising and bleeding from the gums suggest a problem with blood clotting, which could be due to diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection. This is supported by the presence of numerous bruises in various stages of resolution, which suggests that there has been ongoing bleeding over time. Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is diffuse intravascular coagulation secondary to infection.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 32-year-old man who has been experiencing difficulty focusing on tasks at work and at home for the past 2 months. He has had a lot of energy, but often gets distracted to the point that he does not complete assigned tasks. He also reports that he now needs only 4 hours of sleep nightly. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of alcohol and drug abuse, coupled with his current behavior at work, suggests a possible diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, which is characterized by a disregard for social norms and the rights of others. However, the patient's recent improvement in mood and energy levels, as well as his ability to focus and concentrate, suggest that this diagnosis may not be the only explanation for the patient's behavior.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has filed a malpractice suit against the physician, which suggests that the patient is unhappy with the care they received. Given this context, it's likely that the patient's decision to file a malpractice suit was influenced by their perception of the physician's competence and caring attitude. Therefore, the most likely precipitating factor in this patient's decision to file a malpractice suit is their perception that the physician is incompetent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's socioeconomic status can influence his perception of the physician's competence and care, leading to dissatisfaction and a potential lawsuit. However, this is not the most likely precipitating factor in this patient' s decision to file a malpractice suit.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 29-year-old male who has relocated to take a promotion and has found himself unable to concentrate on his new duties. He also reports feeling restless, having poor sleep, and experiencing a pounding heart. Given these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is an adjustment disorder with anxious mood.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of poor sleep, restlessness, and inability to concentrate are consistent with major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate. Additionally, the patient's history of calling in sick three days within the past two weeks suggests that he may be experiencing some level of impairment in his daily life. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is major depressive disorder, single episode, moderate.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has developed tachycardia, which is an indication of increased sympathetic tone. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is elevated at 130/80 mm Hg. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis. In this scenario, the most appropriate step would be to administer beta-blocking medications to help reduce the patient's heart rate and blood pressure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's restlessness and combative behavior are likely due to anxiety caused by the pneumothorax and the need for mechanical ventilation. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, can help reduce anxiety and improve the patient's comfort. Therefore, the most appropriate step is to administer alprazolam.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is experiencing episodes of fainting, which could be related to the cardiac condition. The ECG shows a P- wave rate of 90/minute, an R-wave rate of 40/minute, with no apparent relation between the two. This suggests that the arrhythmia may not be directly related to the atrioventricular block. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a second-degree atrioventricular block, type II.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ECG findings show a P-wave rate that is faster than the R-wave rate, which is characteristic of second-degree atrioventricular block, type I. This means that not all P waves are conducted to the ventricles. The patient's symptoms of fainting and fatigue also support this diagnosis.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of increased glandularity in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast, which was evaluated with mammography and ultrasonography 2 months ago. The studies showed likely benign findings with recommended follow-up in 6 months. However, the patient is now presenting with black discharge from her right nipple, which is concerning for a ductal abnormality. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to perform ductography.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of increased glandularity in the right breast and the black discharge from the nipple raise concerns about the possibility of cancer. Therefore, a repeat mammography is necessary to rule out any malignant changes. Additionally, a ductogram may also be considered as it can provide more detailed information about the ductal system.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing heavy menses and low back pain, which are symptoms of endometriosis. An endometrial biopsy specimen shows regular tubular endometrial glands with abundant mitotic figures in the endometrial glands and stroma. This suggests that the patient's menstrual cycle is progressing normally. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Cyclin-dependent kinases.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lipid kinases are involved in cell signaling and play a role in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, they are likely involved in the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle. The other options do not directly regulate the progression of cells into the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 33-year-old woman who has been experiencing symptoms such as mild nausea, increased urinary urgency and frequency, and constipation for the past 2 days. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the past 2 weeks and a 3-week history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination shows a nodular cervix with an irregular, friable posterior lip, and a rock-hard, irregular, immobile pelvic mass that extends across the pelvis. Examination of biopsy specimens from the cervix and anterior wall of the vagina show well-differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Based on these findings, it is likely that this patient's disease is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Therefore, the best answer is B: Insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Specialized transduction is a process by which genetic material is transferred from one organism to another. This process can lead to the development of cancer, so it is possible that this is the pathogenesis of this patient's disease. However, based on the information provided, it seems more likely that the pathogenesis of this patient's disease is related to the insertion of viral promotors adjacent to cellular growth factor genes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing numbness and tingling in her right hand, particularly in the ring and small fingers. This suggests that there may be compression or entrapment of a nerve in this region. The patient's history of playing softball as a pitcher for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago suggests that there may have been repetitive strain on the nerves in this region, leading to compression or entrapment. The patient's symptoms are consistent with compression or entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, which is a common site for nerve compression due to its proximity to the medial epicondyle and the olecranon process. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the ulnar nerve on the right.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling in the right hand are consistent with median nerve entrapment at the wrist, which is a common condition. The patient's history of playing softball as a pitcher for 5 years until she stopped 2 years ago suggests that repetitive strain or overuse may have contributed to the development of this condition. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl, which makes it less likely that she has a serious cardiac condition. The physical examination reveals a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the upper left sternal border, which suggests that there may be some obstruction to blood flow through the pulmonary valve. Additionally, the soft mid-diastolic murmur along the lower left sternal border suggests that there may also be some mitral regurgitation. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a combination of mild pulmonary stenosis and mitral regurgitation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The systolic ejection murmur heard along the upper left sternal border is characteristic of aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aortic valve. The soft mid-diastolic murmur heard along the lower left sternal border suggests that there may be some mitral regurgitation or mitral valve prolapse. However, given the presence of a systolic ejection murmur and a soft mid-diastolic murmur, the most likely diagnosis is aortic stenosis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, which may have contributed to the decline in blood pressure. Additionally, the patient has received 4 L of intravenous crystalloid in the recovery room, which may also have contributed to the decline in blood pressure. Furthermore, the patient's hematocrit is 30%, which is lower than their preoperative value of 41%. This suggests that the patient has lost a significant amount of blood during surgery, which would further contribute to the decline in blood pressure. Therefore, based on these findings, it is most likely that damage to the middle colic artery is responsible for these findings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle colic artery supplies blood to the colon, so damage to this artery could lead to bleeding and a drop in blood pressure. Therefore, the middle colic artery is the most likely structure to be damaged in this case. ",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy, which suggests an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. The bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis, which is consistent with osteomyelitis. The culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens, which is a common cause of osteomyelitis. Therefore, the most likely mechanism for these findings is impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dysmorphogenesis of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches can lead to immune system defects, such as a lack of T cells or B cells. This could explain the patient's recurrent infections. Additionally, impaired chemotaxis could also contribute to the patient's increased susceptibility to infection.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of passing a renal calculus, and the X-ray crystallographic analysis showed calcium as the primary cation. This suggests that the patient is experiencing hypercalciuria, which is an excessive excretion of calcium in the urine. To manage this condition, we need to reduce the amount of calcium in the urine. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition would be a diuretic that increases the excretion of calcium in the urine. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Osmotic diuretic.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Na+ –K + –2Cl− symport inhibitors, such as thiazides, can help to reduce calcium excretion by increasing the reabsorption of calcium in the distal convoluted tubule. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a thiazide diuretic.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a paraplegic with recurrent calcium oxalate kidney stones, and recent onset of incontinence secondary to detrusor and bladder neck dysfunction. Given his history of anaphylaxis secondary to latex allergy during a previous operation, it is crucial to consider the potential risks associated with the use of rubber urethral catheters. Therefore, the most important consideration in the care of this patient is the administration of injectable medications with disposable syringes and the avoidance of any medical equipment or supplies that may contain latex.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of latex allergy, so the use of rubber urethral catheters, which often contain latex, could trigger an allergic reaction. Therefore, it is most important to consider avoiding the use of rubber urethral catheters in this patient.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. When the sample size is reduced, the power of the study decreases. This means that there will be a higher chance of failing to detect a statistically significant difference between the new drug and standard treatment. Therefore, if this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?",B,"Let's reason step by step. A smaller sample size would increase the power of the study, since it would be easier to detect a significant difference between the two groups. However, this increased power comes at the cost of an increased chance of a type I error. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Power of the study.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has never had a menstrual period. She has normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia. However, she has no axillary or pubic hair. This suggests that the patient may have some type of hormonal disorder. Given the patient's age and physical examination findings, the most likely explanation for her clinical presentation is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's lack of menstruation and the absence of axillary or pubic hair suggest a possible hormonal imbalance or a developmental disorder. However, since she refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination, a psychiatric disorder, such as anorexia nervosa, could be the cause of her amenorrhea. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation is option D: A psychiatric disorder.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 75-year-old female who presents with fatigue, which is a common symptom of many diseases. However, the patient's laboratory studies reveal a leukocyte count of 25.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/μL, which is within the reference range for white blood cell count. Additionally, the peripheral blood smear shows 97% mature-appearing lymphocytes, which suggests that the patient's bone marrow is producing a normal number of white blood cells. Finally, immunohistochemical stains demonstrate that the lymphocytes are of B-cell origin. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a high leukocyte count and a high proportion of lymphocytes, which could be suggestive of acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, the patient's age and the mature-appearing lymphocytes suggest a chronic process. Furthermore, the immunohistochemical stains demonstrate B-cell origin, which is consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old woman at 34 weeks' gestation, who has had no prenatal care and has been experiencing vaginal bleeding for 2 hours. Her pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. Given these symptoms and signs, the most likely diagnosis is placenta previa.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of a previous cesarean section and current vaginal bleeding suggest abruptio placentae, a serious condition where the placenta prematurely detaches from the uterine wall. However, the lack of abdominal pain and the absence of contractions point towards another cause. Given the presence of blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of each thigh, as well as the transverse lie presentation of the fetus, the most likely diagnosis is placenta previa.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 30-year-old nulliparous female who presents with mood changes, specifically anxious, hyperactive, and unable to sleep for several days prior to the onset of menses. She also reports that on the day her menses begins she becomes acutely depressed, anorectic, irritable, and lethargic. Given this information, it is likely that the patient has a premenstrual disorder (PMD), specifically premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). PMDD is characterized by severe mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and depression, which occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, hyperactivity, and insomnia are common features of generalized anxiety disorder. However, the cyclical nature of her symptoms, with the onset of depression coinciding with her menstrual cycle, suggests a different diagnosis. This pattern is consistent with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which is characterized by severe mood disturbances that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a lump on her neck that she noted one week ago. She denies any tenderness, fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination reveals a freely movable mass in the lower left lobe of the thyroid gland. In this case, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is fine-needle aspiration (FNA) because it allows for rapid and minimally invasive evaluation of the lesion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. An iodine131 scan is a good method for evaluating thyroid function and nodules, but it is not the best initial method because it involves exposure to radiation. Therefore, a less invasive method such as ultrasonography should be used first. If the lesion appears suspicious or malignant on ultrasound, then fine-needle aspiration biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 37-year-old woman who was found unconscious on her apartment floor. She has a history of substance abuse, as evidenced by the positive urine toxicology screening for opiates and cocaine. Her physical examination shows erythema, warmth, and induration of the upper back, buttocks, and posterior thighs, which is consistent with a skin rash. Her laboratory results show an elevated serum creatine kinase activity, which suggests muscle damage. Given this information, the patient is at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) over the next 24 hours due to her history of substance abuse, muscle damage, and potential rhabdomyolysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of altered mental status and elevated creatine kinase levels are suggestive of cerebral edema, a potentially life-threatening condition. However, the presence of myoglobinuria suggests a different cause for the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's history of substance abuse and the presence of myoglobinuria, it is likely that the patient has suffered an acute rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) if left untreated.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, which are referred to as 'drop attacks.' These symptoms are not typical of anxiety or cardiac arrhythmia. Atlanto-axial instability could potentially cause weakness and numbness in the arms and legs, but it would not typically cause a sudden onset of weakness and loss of feeling in the legs. Adrenal insufficiency is a possibility, as it can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and changes in skin pigmentation. However, adrenal insufficiency typically presents with more gradual onset of symptoms over several days or weeks, rather than acute episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in the legs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's history of emotional distress and the occurrence of ""drop attacks"" during periods of high stress suggest that anxiety may be a contributing factor. However, the sudden onset and the presence of incontinence point towards a more neurological cause. Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, which can affect the nervous system, and the presence of other symptoms such as facial plethora and swollen joints, it is likely that the  ""drop attacks"" are related to an underlying neurological disorder rather than anxiety or cardiac arrhythmia.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a 3-day history of sore throat, nonproductive cough, runny nose, and frontal headache. He also mentions that the headache is worse in the morning and ibuprofen does provide some relief. Given these symptoms, it's likely that the patient has an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The most common causes of URTI are viral infections such as rhinovirus, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza viruses. Bacterial infections such as streptococcus pharyngitis can also cause URTI. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that he has not had shortness of breath, it is most likely that the patient has a viral URTI caused by one of the common viral pathogens mentioned above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cough, sore throat, and headache are common features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. However, the lack of shortness of breath and the presence of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia suggest a different diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis is unlikely given the absence of nasal congestion and discharge. Epstein-Barr virus is also unlikely given the absence of fever and the presence of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia suggests a viral infection, but not Epstein-Barr virus. Rhinovirus is also unlikely given the absence of nasal congestion and discharge. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient'’s symptoms is Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 15-year-old male who has been experiencing painful swelling over the sacral prominence for 2 days. He also has a low-grade fever. Examination reveals an erythematous, fluctuant, elevated mass with 3 midline pores. Rectal examination reveals no induration or pain. Given these symptoms and physical findings, the most likely diagnosis is hidradenitis suppurativa (Hidradenitis Suppurativa).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of a painful, fluctuant mass with multiple openings are suggestive of hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic inflammatory condition of the apocrine glands. However, the location of the mass and the lack of involvement of the rectum point towards a different diagnosis. Given the presence of midline pores and the absence of induration or pain on rectal examination, the most likely diagnosis is pilonidal abscess.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 32-year-old man with fair skin, little facial hair, mild gynecomastia, and small, firm testicles. His semen analysis shows no sperm. Given these findings, the most likely cause of this couple's infertility is a male factor, specifically azoospermia (the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Therefore, the next step would be to perform a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes to rule out any chromosomal abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's azoospermia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of gynecomastia and small testicles are suggestive of elevated prolactin levels. However, the absence of sperm on semen analysis suggests a different cause for the infertility. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), which is characterized by low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This condition can be caused by genetic mutations, hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, or environmental factors. Therefore, the most likely test to establish the underlying cause of this couple'’s infertility is a karyotype from peripheral leukocytes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a history of acne for 3 months. She has breast and pubic hair development, which suggests that she is in Tanner stage 5. Given the patient's age and physical examination findings, it is likely that her acne is related to hormonal changes associated with puberty. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient'\'s acne is increased estrogen stimulation of the sebaceous glands.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's acne is likely due to hormonal changes associated with puberty, which could involve increased responsiveness of the sebaceous glands to follicle-stimulating hormone. However, the presence of acne in conjunction with the development of secondary sexual characteristics suggests a different underlying cause. Given that the patient has Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, it is likely that the underlying cause of the patient' s acne is increased androgen stimulation of the sebaceous glands.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient presents with a 1-day history of throbbing facial pain, which is consistent with sinusitis. The patient also has nasal congestion, purulent nasal discharge, sore throat, and a nonproductive cough, which are all consistent with acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). Given the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely causal organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae, as it is the most common cause of ARS.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of sinusitis and facial pain are suggestive of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection, a common cause of bacterial sinusitis. However, the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms suggest a different diagnosis. Moraxella catarrhalis is another common cause of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in older adults. It is also known to cause otitis media and bronchitis. Given the patient's symptoms and age, Moraxella catarrhalis is the most likely causal organism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing early awakening at night, which is not related to depression or nightmares. Given the patient's history of physical activity and no history of depression, it is unlikely that sertraline would be an effective treatment for this patient's insomnia. Therefore, the most appropriate management of this patient's insomnia is to advise him to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Reading and snacking in bed can help promote relaxation and sleepiness. However, the patient's insomnia is likely due to a different cause, and these activities may not be effective in addressing the underlying issue. Therefore, option B is incorrect. The other options are also incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's insomnia.",A
A,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has been experiencing exercise-induced cough and nasal congestion for the past 2 months. She plays field hockey, which involves running up and down the field. This suggests that her symptoms are related to exercise. Additionally, she has no history of chest pain or palpitations, which makes it less likely that her symptoms are related to a cardiac condition.",-,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of cough and nasal congestion are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease, a common condition that can cause these symptoms. However, the exercise-induced nature of the symptoms and the absence of chest pain suggest a different diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's sister has asthma, which suggests that the patient may have an underlying airway hyperresponsiveness. Given this information, the most likely diagnosis is asthma.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. Specifically, the T7-L2 segments of the spinal cord are responsible for innervating the small intestine, which is the primary site of absorption of nutrients in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sympathetic nervous system plays a role in the regulation of the digestive system, and the C1-C2 spinal segments are involved in the autonomic nervous system. However, the specific innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from a different spinal level. According to the text, the patient has been constipated for the past 5 days, which suggests that the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in this patient's condition originates from T7-L2 spinal segments.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing a range of symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema on her hands and feet. These symptoms are consistent with an immune-mediated reaction. Given that the patient was treated with rabbit antithymocyte globulin, it is likely that the reaction is related to the administration of this medication. Therefore, the most likely cause of these symptoms is immune complex deposition in tissues.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Natural killer cells play a role in the immune response and can secrete cytokines that can cause symptoms such as fever and arthralgias. However, the patient's symptoms are more likely caused by a different mechanism. The patient has developed a severe reaction to the antithymocyte globulin, which is consistent with an immune complex-mediated reaction. Therefore, the most likely cause of these symptoms is immune complex deposition in tissues.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has had this mass since childhood, and it is painless. This suggests that the mass may be a congenital anomaly rather than an acquired condition. Furthermore, the fact that the mass transilluminates suggests that it may be a hydrocele or a hernia. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the mass is a persistence of a patent processus vaginalis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's scrotal mass is soft and nontender, which could be suggestive of accumulation of scrotal adipose tissue. However, the mass transilluminates, which is not a typical feature of adipose tissue. Additionally, there are no bowel sounds in the mass, which suggests that it may not be related to the digestive system. Therefore, based on these findings, the most likely cause of the mass is persistence of a patent processus vaginalis.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young adult who has had a headache, cough, and fever for 3 days. She was treated with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan. After the seizure, she was confused and had difficulty thinking of some words. Her neurologic examination shows diffuse hyperreflexia. On mental status examination, she is confused and has short-term memory deficits. She has difficulty naming objects and makes literal paraphasic errors. An MRI of the brain shows bitemporal hyperintensities. A lumbar puncture is done; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows an erythrocyte count of 340/ mm3, a leukocyte count of 121/mm3 (88% monocytes), and a protein concentration of 78 mg/dL. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is...",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and altered mental status are suggestive of bacterial meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges. However, the presence of bitemporal hyperintensities on MRI and the cerebrospinal fluid findings point towards a different diagnosis. The erythrocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid is elevated, which suggests bleeding within the central nervous system. Additionally, the leukocyte count is predominantly composed of monocytes, which is consistent with an inflammatory response. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a rare and serious infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a young woman who has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months, which suggests that she may have a hormonal disorder. She also reports irregular menses prior to complete cessation, and an increasing problem with acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). These symptoms are consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The patient's family history also supports this diagnosis, as one of her sisters had similar symptoms prior to getting married.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms of irregular menses, acne, and hirsutism are suggestive of an androgen-producing ovarian tumor, a rare condition that can cause these symptoms. However, the absence of other clinical features and the family history suggest a different diagnosis. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a common endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menses, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound examination. PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and endometrial cancer.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a history of abnormal Pap smear in her 20s, which was treated and had normal results for the past 12 years. She has been experiencing vaginal discharge and spotting for the past 6 months, which worsened to heavy bleeding over the past 3 weeks. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for blood pressure, which is slightly elevated. BMI is 32 kg/m2. Based on this information, the most critical factor in formulating a management plan for this patient is her cervical lesion, specifically the 1-cm exophytic mass lateral to the cervical os at the nine o'clock position. This finding suggests that the patient may have cervical cancer, which requires immediate attention and further evaluation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's age is a factor to consider in the management plan, but the stage of the disease is more critical in determining the appropriate course of action. The patient has a friable cervix with an exophytic mass, which suggests that the disease may be at an advanced stage. Therefore, the most critical factor in formulating a management plan for this patient is the stage of the disease.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with a syncopal event while walking. This suggests that the episode was likely caused by a cardiac arrhythmia or valvular abnormality. The presence of a grade 3/6 systolic murmur, heard best at the right upper sternal border and radiating into the neck, suggests that the most likely cause of this episode is mitral regurgitation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's syncopal event and the presence of a systolic murmur suggest aortic insufficiency, a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly. However, the location of the murmur and the radiation into the neck point towards a different diagnosis. Given that the murmur is heard best at the right upper sternal border and radiates into the neck, it is more likely that the patient has mitral regurgitation rather than aortic insufficiency.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage, which could have caused compression or damage to surrounding nerves and blood vessels. The patient also has a history of warfarin use, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications. Given these factors, it is most likely that the decreased sensation in the left thigh is due to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's recent history of cerebral infarction suggests a possible neurological complication, which could explain the tingling sensation. However, this is not the most likely cause of the decreased sensation in the left thigh. The patient had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and an IVC filter placement during her hospitalization, which increases the risk of nerve compression or damage. Therefore, the most likely cause of the decreased sensation in the left thigh is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a fever, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. These symptoms are consistent with Kawasaki disease, an acute febrile illness that primarily affects children under the age of 5. Kawasaki disease is characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, which can lead to coronary artery aneurysms if left untreated. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of this illness would be intravenous immune globulin.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a bacterial infection, and penicillin is the preferred antibiotic for such conditions. Therefore, intravenous penicillin would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of this illness.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is a 65-year-old female who has developed aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and urinary incontinence. There is no evidence of urinary tract infection or prior history of urinary pathology. Given these symptoms and the lack of other explanations, the most likely diagnosis is reflex neurogenic bladder (C).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's urinary incontinence is likely due to a reflex response to the neurological deficit, as the bladder is unable to contract appropriately. This suggests that the most likely diagnosis is reflex neurogenic bladder.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the absolute risk reduction for vomiting among patients in the azithromycin group is represented by a value. This value represents the difference between the proportion of patients who experience vomiting in the erythromycin group and the proportion of patients who experience vomiting in the azithromycin group. The correct answer is 0.33, which means that for every 100 patients treated with azithromycin, 33 fewer patients will experience vomiting compared to those treated with erythromycin.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute risk reduction is the difference between the two groups' rates, which in this case is 15% - 5% = 10%. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.1.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years, which suggests that he is at high risk for reinfection. Given this information, it is likely that the infecting organism is able to evade the host's immune system and cause reinfection. This could be due to antigenic variation, where the infecting organism undergoes genetic changes that allow it to evade recognition by the host's immune system.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The recurrent urethritis suggests an impaired immune response, possibly due to the inhibition of B-lymphocyte function, leading to a reduced antibody production. This would allow the infecting organism to evade the host's immune system and cause repeated infections.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is experiencing symptoms such as nervousness, dizziness, palpitations, and excess perspiration, which are consistent with hypoglycemia. The patient's serum glucose concentration is 30 mg/dL, which further supports the diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis would be to measure the patient's serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms, including nervousness, dizziness, and low blood sugar, suggest a possible cortisol deficiency, which can be further investigated by measuring serum cortisol and ACTH concentrations. Additionally, the patient'has been drinking two alcoholic beverages daily for the past month, which may also contribute to the development of hypoglycemia.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. However, the pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. This suggests that the pain is related to inflammation of a tendon in the rotator cuff. The most likely tendon to be inflamed is the supraspinatus tendon, which is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest an injury to the supraspinatus tendon, which is a common site for rotator cuff tears and can cause pain with external rotation. Additionally, the fact that the patient has no weakness suggests that the injury is likely acute rather than chronic.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a squamous cell carcinoma on the apex of his tongue, which is a high-risk area for metastasis. Given this information, it's most appropriate to evaluate the lymph nodes in the following order: first, the level IIA and IIB lymph nodes (i.e., the lateral neck lymph nodes), then the level III and IV lymph nodes (i.e., the medial neck lymph nodes). This is because the level IIA and IIB lymph nodes are the most likely to be involved with metastasis from a tongue cancer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes are located in the back of the throat and are likely the first to be affected by metastasis from tongue cancer due to their proximity. Inferior deep cervical lymph nodes are also a possibility, but they are slightly farther away from the primary tumor site. Therefore, it is most appropriate to evaluate the retropharyngeal lymph nodes first for evidence of metastasis in this patient.",C
