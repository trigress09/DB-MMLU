A,"Let's reason step by step. Codons are the fundamental units of genetic information, and they are composed of triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA. This means that each codon is a sequence of three nucleotides, such as adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that adenine and thymine bind with two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine and guanine bind with three. So it makes sense that codons are composed of quadruplet sequences of nucleotide bases. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is A: triplet sequences of nucleotide bases in mRNA or DNA.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is a complex phenomenon that involves various physiological and biochemical changes. One of the key factors implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue is an accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) within the muscles. This occurs as a result of the breakdown of ATP to ADP + Pi, which is a normal process during muscle contraction. However, during repeated sprint activities, this process can become impaired, leading to an accumulation of Pi and ultimately, peripheral muscle fatigue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A lack of potassium can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced during multiple sprint activities. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a lack of potassium may be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities.",D

When DNA polymerase creates the complimentary strand, it will add nucleotides in a way that maintains the base pairing rules (A-T and G-C). Therefore, the ratio of A:Ts in the newly synthesized complimentary strand is also 3:2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T, then the newly synthesized strand will also have a 3:2 ratio of A:T because they are complementary. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The person is suffering from severe dehydration and starvation, which would lead to a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of hormones that regulate glucose metabolism, such as insulin. On the other hand, hormones that regulate electrolyte balance, such as aldosterone, are more likely to be elevated in response to dehydration. Therefore, it is most unlikely that this person's plasma concentration of insulin would be elevated.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aldosterone helps the body retain sodium, which is important for maintaining blood volume and blood pressure. In a state of dehydration and starvation, the body would need to conserve fluids, so aldosterone levels would be elevated. The other options do not make sense in this context.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant is a type of lipoprotein that plays a crucial role in facilitating oxygen diffusion across alveolar membranes. It does this by reducing the surface tension of the fluid lining the alveoli, allowing for easier gas exchange between the airspaces and the bloodstream. In other words, surfactant helps to maintain the integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, enabling efficient gas exchange and facilitating oxygen diffusion across the alveolar membranes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant likely increases the permeability of the alveolar membrane, allowing for easier diffusion of oxygen into the bloodstream. This is crucial in premature infants who have underdeveloped lungs and are at risk of developing respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In sport, success is influenced by a combination of factors, including physical ability, mental toughness, tactics, and nutrition. However, one factor that does not directly influence success in sport is the ingestion of carnitine during exercise. Carnitine is an amino acid that plays a role in energy production within cells, but it is not a direct determinant of athletic performance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Tactics are not as important as physical training, mental preparation, and a healthy diet for achieving success in sport. Ingestion of carnitine during exercise is also not a crucial factor for success in sport. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Ingestion of carnitine during exercise.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is a process that involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, with the release of energy in the form of ATP. According to the equation, one molecule of glucose yields two molecules of pyruvate and two molecules of ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 2 molecules of ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvate, and water molecules are produced as a byproduct. So, the net formation would be six molecules of water. This is because two molecules of water were formed during glycolysis, but one molecule was used to form ATP.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The starting velocity of water from a fire hydrant is given as 2 m/s. The pressure is kept constant, which means the energy of the water remains the same. The area of the nozzle at the end is 1/3 the area of the start of the hose. This means that the velocity of the water increases as it passes through the nozzle. To find the final velocity of the water, we can use the equation v2 = v1^2 * (A1/A2), where v1 and v2 are the initial and final velocities respectively, A1 and A2 are the areas at the beginning and end of the nozzle respectively. Substituting the given values, we get v2 = 2 m/s * (1/3)^0.5 = 4 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pressure of the water is kept constant, the velocity of the water should also remain constant as it exits the nozzle. However, since the area of the nozzle is reduced to 1/3 of its original size, the velocity of the water exiting the nozzle will increase due to conservation of mass and momentum. Therefore, we can conclude that the final velocity of the water as it exits the nozzle is greater than the initial velocity of 2 m/s.",B

The question asks how many electrons have a quantum number l = 2. In the electron configuration, we can see that the subshells with l = 2 are the d-subshell (n = 3, l = 2) and the f-subshell (n = 4, l = 2). The d-subshell has 5 electrons, and the f-subshell is empty. Therefore, the total number of electrons with a quantum number l = 2 is 5.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gold is in the d-block of the periodic table and has one electron in its outermost s orbital and ten electrons in its d orbitals, so it should have 1 + 10 = 11 electrons with l = 2. However, since we are asked to find the number of electrons that have a quantum number l  = 2, which is equivalent to finding the number of electrons in the d orbitals, we can conclude that the correct answer is 10.",D

Strong acids are typically characterized by their ability to completely dissociate into ions in aqueous solution, resulting in a high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). This is reflected in statement C: 'They have stable conjugate bases'. In other words, strong acids have conjugate bases that are stable and do not readily react with water. This allows the acid to remain fully dissociated in aqueous solution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Strong acids are those that do not fully dissociate in water, meaning their Ka value is less than 1. This means that strong acids have a very low tendency to form conjugate bases. Therefore, the statement that corresponds most accurately with strong acids is 'Ka is less than 1'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about what is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of cells because they generate most of the energy that the cell needs to function. The electron transport chain, which is responsible for generating most of the ATP that the cell produces, is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the components of the electron transport chain are embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mitochondria are responsible for energy production, and glycogen is a stored form of glucose, so it makes sense that glycogen molecules would be embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. An action potential arriving at the motor endplate causes release of a neurotransmitter, which then binds to receptors on the muscle membrane. The correct answer is A: acetylcholine which traverses the neuromuscular junction.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

This is a key characteristic of passive transport, as it relies solely on the concentration gradient to drive the movement of molecules across the cell membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Passive Transport.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Endocytosis involves the movement of materials into the cell through the formation of vesicles, which is driven by the concentration gradient of the material outside the cell. Osmosis, on the other hand, is a type of passive transport that allows water molecules to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration across a selectively permeable membrane. Passive Transport does not specify the direction of movement, whereas Active Transport requires energy to move materials against their concentration gradient. Therefore, Osmosis is the correct answer.",A

This means it helps to break down and solubilize proteins, allowing them to be separated based on their size and charge. In this case, the SDS is not used to denature or break apart the protein molecules, but rather to help solubilize and separate them based on their size and charge.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The SDS detergent helps to prevent the protein from denaturing during electrophoresis, ensuring that the separation is based on the protein's true tertiary structure. This is particularly important because proteins can have multiple conformations and it's essential to preserve their native structure during analysis.",C

This behavior is due to the difference in surface tension between the two liquids. Mercury has a higher surface tension than water, which causes it to form a convex meniscus. On the other hand, water has a lower surface tension than mercury, which causes it to form a concave meniscus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The shape of the meniscus depends on the interaction between the liquid and the material of the graduated cylinder. Since water forms a concave meniscus, it must have a stronger attraction to the cylinder walls than mercury does. This is because the adhesive forces between water and the cylinder walls are greater than the adhesive forces between mercury and the cylinder walls.",B

The process of glucose uptake into muscle cells involves several steps, including binding to specific receptors on the surface of the muscle cell, followed by internalization and degradation of the receptor-bound glucose. In this context, option A is the most accurate answer, as it correctly describes the mechanism of glucose transport into muscle cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose enters the muscle cell and is immediately acted upon by the enzyme hexokinase, which facilitates its transport across the cell membrane.

Based on this definition, we can identify which option is NOT an aspect of the McDonaldization of Society. Option D, 'An intense effort on achieving sameness across diverse markets', does not fit with the concept of McDonaldization, as it emphasizes uniqueness and diversity rather than standardization and homogenization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. McDonaldization is all about creating efficient systems with clear divisions of labor and established protocols. This aligns perfectly with the characteristics of a bureaucratic organization. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training is a type of exercise that focuses on increasing the body's ability to sustain prolonged physical activity. This type of training increases the muscle's capacity to generate energy aerobically, which means through the process of cellular respiration. Therefore, endurance training increases the muscle's capacity to generate energy aerobically.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training focuses on improving the muscle's ability to sustain activity over long periods. This involves enhancing the breakdown of phosphocreatine, which is a key energy source for short bursts of power. Additionally, endurance training also increases the muscle's capacity to burn fat and carbohydrate as fuel sources. Therefore, the correct answer is B: break down phosphocreatine.",B

This means that the anaerobic contribution to energy production progressively increases as the intensity and duration of the sprints increase.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increases, the body's glucose stores become depleted, leading to a significant drop in blood glucose concentration below the critical level of 3 mmol/L. This is because during intense exercise like sprinting, the muscles rely heavily on anaerobic metabolism for energy production, which depletes muscle glycogen and leads to a rapid decrease in blood glucose levels.",C

This approach shows a willingness to learn from mistakes and improve one's performance.",D,"Let's reason step by step. By expressing concern about the teacher's grading and potential bias, Tyler demonstrates a willingness to seek external feedback and identify areas for improvement. This approach is more likely to lead to growth and development compared to simply blaming circumstances or others.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Protein modification after translation can occur through various mechanisms, including lipidation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. However, the process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred is attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. This is because peptide bond formation occurs during protein synthesis, whereas the other processes listed occur post-translationally.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that involves changing the protein's structure by adding sugar molecules, which can affect its folding and function. Lipidation, attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, phosphorylation are all other types of post-translational modifications that can occur after translation has occurred. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The tricarboxylic acid cycle (Krebs' cycle) is a series of chemical reactions that occur within the mitochondria of cells. During one complete turn of the Krebs' cycle, three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2 are produced. These energy-rich molecules then pass their electrons to the electron transport chain, generating ATP. Therefore, during one complete turn of the Krebs' cycle, 2CO2 and 12ATP are formed.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Krebs cycle generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and also produces NADH and FADH2, which contribute to ATP production in the electron transport chain. Considering all ATP generated, one complete cycle should yield around 16 ATP molecules. However, this number is not directly related to CO2 produced during the cycle. Therefore, we can conclude that option B is incorrect.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Metabolism is the process by which cells convert nutrients into energy and other essential compounds. The key to understanding metabolism is that it is determined by the proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material. These proteins play a crucial role in regulating metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and many others. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Proteins formed as dictated by the genetic material.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Metabolism encompasses all the chemical reactions within a cell. Since proteins are the main catalysts for these reactions, the size of the proteins present would directly influence the overall metabolic rate. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactate and hydrogen ions are waste products that accumulate in the muscle tissue during intense exercise. To remove these waste products, the muscle cells use a mechanism called cotransport. This mechanism allows lactate and hydrogen ions to be transported out of the muscle cell together with another molecule called carnosine. Therefore, the correct answer is A: via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, lactate and hydrogen ions accumulate in the muscle. Carnosine acts as a buffer, binding to these ions and transporting them out of the muscle to maintain pH balance. Therefore, the correct answer is A: via a cotransport mechanism with carnosine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients often have a loss of pancreas activity during their adolescent years. This leads to a deficiency in the production of digestive enzymes, including trypsinogen. Trypsinogen is an enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. Without sufficient trypsinogen, protein digestion would be severely impaired, leading to malabsorption of essential nutrients.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carboxypeptidase plays a crucial role in the final stages of protein digestion, ensuring complete breakdown of peptides into individual amino acids for absorption. Its deficiency would significantly impair nutrient uptake. Therefore, if isolated, carboxypeptidase deficiency would lead to the most extensive effects on nutrient absorption.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle is a crucial process for maintaining muscle mass and function. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, plays a key role in promoting glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. When insulin binds to its receptors on muscle cells, it triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to increased glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Insulin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline is released during stress or exercise, preparing the body for action. It stimulates the breakdown of glycogen and release of glucose into the bloodstream, making it readily available for muscle uptake. However, adrenaline does not directly promote amino acid uptake by muscle. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Insulin.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nietzsche's Will to Truth refers to the fundamental drive or instinct that motivates individuals to seek knowledge and understanding. This concept is closely related to the idea of the 'will to power', which is another central concept in Nietzsche's philosophy. In this context, the most accurate definition of Nietzsche's Will to Truth would be an intrinsic desire to know the truth, driven by a fundamental drive or instinct that motivates individuals to seek knowledge and understanding.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nietzsche's Will to Truth is deeply rooted in our subconscious desires and motivations. It can be considered a part of our ego, driving us to seek knowledge and understanding of the world.

Additionally, the fact that the hormone is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings further supports this conclusion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hormone's ability to increase nucleic acid suggests it plays a role in regulating gene expression or DNA replication.

In this case, if another group of people were to appear one block up the street, it would likely increase the number of bystanders and decrease the likelihood of the pedestrian taking action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that the presence of other people diffuses responsibility, making individuals less likely to intervene. Therefore, knowing there's another group nearby would likely reduce the pedestrian's willingness to help. This is because the presence of others would make it seem like someone else will take care of the situation, reducing the pedestrian's sense of personal responsibility.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are a class of therapeutic compounds that bind to androgen receptors in the body, mimicking the effects of testosterone. They are designed to provide the benefits of anabolic steroids without the negative side effects associated with them. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. SARMs are designed to target specific androgen receptors, but unlike traditional steroids, they block the effects of natural hormones, leading to a more controlled and targeted response. Therefore, option C is the most accurate description of SARMs.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinase reactions are a type of enzyme-catalyzed reaction that involves the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another. This process is crucial for various cellular processes, such as signal transduction pathways and metabolic regulation. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinases are essential enzymes that regulate cellular energy by preventing the breakdown of ATP, ensuring a sufficient supply of energy for various cellular processes. Therefore, the correct answer is B: involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The reaction is an elimination reaction, where a leaving group (in this case, bromide) is removed from the molecule, resulting in the formation of a double bond. In this case, the major product is 2-butene because it is more stable than 1-butene due to the conjugation of the double bonds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethanol, as a nucleophile, has a preference for attacking the second carbon in a chain due to steric hindrance at the first carbon. This explains why 2-butene is the major product in this reaction. The minor product of 1-butene can be attributed to the presence of some impurities or side reactions that may have occurred during the reaction.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen breakdown in exercising muscle is activated by a process called glycogenolysis. This process is triggered by an increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the muscle cell. cAMP, in turn, activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and activates glycogen phosphorylase, the enzyme responsible for glycogen breakdown. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is a hormone released during stress, and in stressful situations like exercise, the body needs to break down glycogen for energy. Insulin is not directly involved in this process. Increased pH is also not a factor here. Therefore, the correct answer is none of the above.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The World Systems Theory divides the world into three subcategories: core countries, periphery countries, and semi-periphery countries. Semi-periphery countries are those that have a mix of characteristics from both core and peripheral countries. They often have a diversified economy with a strong manufacturing sector, but may also be dependent on primary commodities such as oil or minerals. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: A diversified and developed economy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Semi-periphery countries are typically still developing, and many developing nations have economies heavily reliant on a single resource like oil or minerals. This is because these resources often provide the primary source of revenue for the country.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The pressure of the system is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas present and inversely proportional to the volume of the container. Therefore, if we increase both the temperature (which increases the kinetic energy of the molecules) and the number of moles of gas (which increases the total amount of gas), then the pressure will increase.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law, pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. So, decreasing both temperature and volume would increase the pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Decreasing volume, decreasing temperature.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that is false is the one that says 'With an increasing number of repeated sprints the rate of accumulation of lactate in muscle declines.' This statement is actually true, as the rate of lactate accumulation typically increases with repeated sprint exercise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which produces ammonia as a byproduct. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that repeated high-intensity exercise would lead to increased production of ammonia. Statement A is therefore true.",A

B,"Let's reason step by step. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In AML, myeloid progenitor cells become rapidly dividing and retain their semi-stem cell state. This means that these cells are capable of differentiating into various types of mature blood cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, red blood cells, and platelets. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the correct answer would be D) Lymphoid progenitor.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is a popular sports supplement that helps to increase muscle strength and endurance. The recommended dose of creatine for loading the muscles is typically around 20-25 grams per day, divided into 4-5 doses. However, this can vary depending on individual factors such as body weight, fitness level, and goals. In this case, since we are dealing with a 70 kg man, the recommended dose would be around 10-12 grams per day, divided into 2-3 doses.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is naturally produced in the body, so a small daily supplement of 5g should be enough to load the muscles within a week. The recommended dose for loading is typically around 20-25 grams per day, but this can vary depending on individual factors such as muscle mass and activity level. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 5 g/day.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following statements identifies a chemically based sensory system. Gustation is the sense of taste, which is mediated by chemical receptors on the tongue. Olfaction is the sense of smell, which is also mediated by chemical receptors in the nasal cavity. Therefore, options I and III are correct, as they both identify chemically based sensory systems.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The gustatory system, responsible for taste, directly interacts with chemicals in food to produce sensations, making it a chemically based system. On the other hand, the auditory, olfactory, and visual systems are not primarily chemically based, as they rely more on physical stimuli such as sound waves, light, or air currents. Therefore, the correct answer is I only.",A

Additionally, fast-twitch fibers have high ATPase activity, which allows them to generate rapid contractions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers are used for quick bursts of energy, so they don't require a lot of mitochondria and have low ATPase activity. On the other hand, slow-twitch fibers are used for sustained activities over long periods of time, so they require more mitochondria and have high ATPase activity. Therefore, fast- twitch fibers contain a relatively small number of mitochondria and low ATPase activity.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The study found that students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61. This suggests that having connections to people who are already part of the desired group (in this case, the alumni network of the selective college) can increase one's chances of being accepted into that group.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The strong correlation between academic achievements and admission acceptance indicates that the selection process is based on merit and academic performance. However, the even stronger correlation between social network overlap with alumni networks and admission acceptance suggests that there may be an additional factor at play.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The officer's behavior is a classic example of unconscious bias, which is rooted in the psychoanalytic framework. According to this framework, unconscious thoughts and feelings can influence our behavior without us even realizing it. In this case, the officer's unconscious bias towards middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes is likely influenced by his own experiences and relationships, particularly those with his father. This bias is then expressed in his behavior, such as writing more tickets for middle-aged white males with dark hair and eyes.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Increasing the substrate concentration would not affect the binding of the non-competitive inhibitor to the allosteric site. Therefore, increasing the substrate concentration would have no effect on the impact of the non-competitive inhibitor.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing substrate concentration wouldn't affect the binding of either type of inhibitor, so there would be no change in their impact on enzyme activity.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean rate of oxygen consumption is given as 2 l/min. We need to find the rate of energy expenditure in kilojoules per minute (kJ/min). To do this, we can use the following formula: Rate of Energy Expenditure = Mean Rate of Oxygen Consumption x Energy Equivalent of Oxygen. The energy equivalent of oxygen is approximately 20 kJ/l. Therefore, we can plug in the values to get: Rate of Energy Expenditure = 2 l/min x 20 kJ/l = 40 kJ/min. Since the options are given as multiples of 10 kJ/min, the closest option would be 40 kJ/min.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Each liter of oxygen consumed roughly corresponds to 20 kJ of energy expenditure, so the athlete would be expending around 200 kJ/min. The closest answer is B: 200 kJ/min.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sex of a child is determined by the combination of chromosomes inherited from each parent. In humans, females have two X chromosomes (XX), while males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Therefore, the correct answer is that the sex of a child is dictated by the inheritance of the X or Y chromosome.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sex-linked traits are determined by recessive alleles on the X chromosome, and since males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to express these traits. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: a recessive allele on the X chromosome.",B

This suggests that the task force is considering a comprehensive approach to address prejudice and hate crimes, rather than relying on a single hypothesis or solution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The legal hypothesis suggests that by implementing stricter anti-hate ordinances, individuals will feel more secure and valued, leading to increased self-esteem and willingness to interact with different groups. This is in line with the contact hypothesis, which states that increased interaction between people from different backgrounds can lead to increased understanding, tolerance, and ultimately, reduced prejudice. The self-esteem hypothesis suggests that when individuals feel valued and respected, they are more likely to develop a positive sense of self-worth, which can lead to increased confidence and willingness to interact with others. Finally, the contact hypothesis also suggests that increased interaction between people from different backgrounds can lead to increased understanding, tolerance, and ultimately, reduced prejudice.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that the son of a bricklayer goes to college and becomes a teacher at a medical school. This indicates that the son has experienced intergenerational mobility with respect to his father, as he has moved from being the child of a manual laborer (bricklayer) to becoming a professional in a different field (teacher at a medical school). Additionally, the fact that the son gets promoted to tenured professor and moves across the country for a new tenured professor position indicates that the son has experienced upward mobility within his profession. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Moving across the country for a new tenured professor position signifies an upward mobility as it often involves a higher salary and greater prestige associated with the new institution.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: intergenerational mobility with respect to the father, upward mobility, horizontal mobility.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in velocity of a fluid is accompanied by a decrease in pressure, and vice versa. In this case, we are comparing the blood pressure in a capillary of the neck to a capillary with an equal cross-sectional area in the right knee. Since both capillaries have the same cross-sectional area, the dynamic pressure (i.e., the pressure due to the flow of blood) is the same for both capillaries. Therefore, according to Bernoulli's principle, the pressure head (i.e., the pressure due to the height of the column of blood) must be greater in the neck than in the knee in order to compensate for the difference in dynamic pressure. This means that the pressure in the neck is greater than the pressure in the knee.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bernoulli's principle primarily deals with ideal fluids, and blood, with its complex composition and properties, requires additional information like viscosity and density for accurate pressure comparisons. In this case, we are comparing the pressure in a capillary of the neck to a capillary with an equal cross-sectional area in the right knee. Since both capillaries have the same cross-sectional area, the dynamic pressure according to Bernoulli's principle would be the same for both capillaries. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The pressure in the neck is equal to the pressure in the knee because of the equal dynamic pressure according to the continuity equation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The interaction between DFP and ACE is an irreversible inhibition, meaning that once DFP binds to ACE, the enzyme is permanently inactivated. This type of inhibition is often referred to as 'irreversible inhibition'. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Irreversible inhibition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since DFP binds to the active site of ACE, it directly competes with the substrate for binding, preventing the enzyme from functioning, which is characteristic of competitive inhibition. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Competitive inhibition.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The teacher's observation is that performance on the quizzes has increased significantly but that tardiness has only decreased slightly. This suggests that the reward system for good quiz scores is having a stronger effect than the punishment system for being late. Therefore, the best explanation for the teacher's observation is option B: 'The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant improvement in quiz performance compared to the slight decrease in tardiness suggests that the students naturally prioritize academic success over punctuality. This is consistent with the idea that intrinsic motivation (i.e., doing well on quizzes) can be a stronger driver of behavior than extrinsic motivators (i.e., showing up on time).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest rate at which an athlete can maintain their performance over a prolonged period of time, typically during a race or competition.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement A is true, as muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate. Statement B is also true, as elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibers in their leg muscles. Statement C is true, as liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration. However, statement D is not entirely accurate. While insulin does promote glucose uptake by many tissues in the body, it does not promote glucose uptake by all tissues. For example, the brain and red blood cells do not require insulin to take up glucose.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, statement B is incorrect.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. When a muscle fibre relaxes, it means that the muscle is no longer contracting. This occurs when the nerve stimulus to contract the muscle is removed. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 'the nerve stimulus is removed'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When the nerve stimulus becomes too forceful, it can overload the muscle fibers, leading to a temporary relaxation to prevent damage. This is not the same as when the nerve stimulus is removed, which would cause the muscle fiber to relax due to lack of stimulation.",A

B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates, ATP and phosphocreatine, is used to sustain maximal exertion exercise. This energy release can only sustain exercise for a short period of time before the energy stores are depleted. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 1-2 seconds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides rapid energy for short bursts of intense activity, lasting approximately 30-40 seconds before other energy systems take over. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 30-40 seconds.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance events such as the marathon race require sustained energy production over a prolonged period. The ability to regulate body temperature is important for overall health, but it's not directly related to endurance performance. Similarly, muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content are important for high-intensity exercise, but they're not critical for endurance events. Therefore, the most important physiological characteristic for success in endurance events such as the marathon race is the ability to supply oxygen to the exercising muscles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for endurance activities, and having ample carbohydrate stores is more critical than oxygen supply for sustained performance in events like marathons.

B,"Let's reason step by step. In games like soccer, blood lactate concentration is a measure of muscle fatigue. As players engage in intense physical activity, their muscles produce lactic acid as a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism. The accumulation of lactic acid in the bloodstream is directly proportional to the intensity and duration of exercise. Therefore, it can be inferred that the blood lactate concentration will increase throughout the course of the game as the players become more fatigued.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As players exert themselves more throughout the game, their muscles produce more lactate, leading to a continuous increase in blood lactate concentration. Therefore, it is most likely that the blood lactate concentration will be higher at the end of the game than at the end of the first half.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are the primary source of energy for most cells, including muscle and liver cells. To be used as an energy source, fatty acids must first be transported into the mitochondria, where they can undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which is then fed into the citric acid cycle to generate ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Carnosine is a dipeptide found in muscle tissue that has been shown to act as an intracellular buffer by buffering excess hydrogen ions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glutamine is involved in nitrogen transport and helps regulate pH balance in the kidneys, so it could also act as an intracellular buffer during high glycolysis rates. However, glutamine is not a specific buffer for pH regulation, whereas carnosine is a dipeptide that acts as a potent intracellular buffer to limit pH changes during high-intensity exercise or other conditions where lactic acid production is increased.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Free fatty acids are the products of triglyceride hydrolysis, which occurs in response to hormonal signals such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones stimulate the breakdown of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are then transported in the blood bound to albumin.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lipoproteins are responsible for transporting lipids in the blood, so it's reasonable to assume they would also transport free fatty acids. Additionally, lipoproteins have been shown to play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport, making them a likely candidate for transporting free fatty acids.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mutations are errors in DNA that can occur spontaneously or as a result of environmental factors such as exposure to carcinogens. The occurrence of mutations is not always harmful, and some mutations may even be beneficial. However, the majority of mutations are neutral, meaning they do not affect the function or fitness of an organism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, and any alteration to the genetic code is likely to have detrimental effects on the organism. Therefore, option A 'are always harmful' is the most accurate answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which statement is false. Statement A is true, as phosphofructokinase is indeed the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. Statement B is also true, as phosphorylase activity is indeed higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres. Statement C is also true, as endurance training does increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. Finally, statement D is also true, as oxygen is indeed consumed in the TCA cycle. Therefore, none of the statements are false, and the correct answer is 'None'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training improves the body's ability to utilize oxygen for energy production, and the TCA cycle is a key pathway in aerobic metabolism, so it makes sense that endurance training would increase TCA cycle enzymes. However, this statement is actually false because endurance training does not directly increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Rf value is a measure of how far a substance travels on a TLC plate compared to the solvent front. A higher Rf value indicates that the substance has traveled farther than the solvent, whereas a lower Rf value indicates that the substance has not traveled as far as the solvent. In this case, since the products have an Rf value significantly higher than the reactants, it suggests that the reaction involves the formation of new bonds or the breaking of existing ones, resulting in a significant change in the molecular structure and properties of the reactants.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A higher Rf value indicates a larger and more complex molecule, which suggests that the reaction involves combining smaller molecules like an ester into a larger one like an anhydride. This is consistent with a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Enzymes are biological molecules that catalyze chemical reactions. The activity of enzymes can be affected by various factors, including temperature, pH, and the presence of certain metal ions. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that all of these factors can affect enzyme activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of certain metal ions can act as cofactors or inhibitors for enzymes, directly influencing their activity. Additionally, temperature and pH are also important factors that can affect enzyme activity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of the above.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The woman is experiencing symptoms of anxiety, such as excessive worrying and difficulty relaxing. She also has a tendency to seek out relationships for comfort and companionship, which may be a coping mechanism for her anxiety. Based on these characteristics, it seems likely that this person would fall under Cluster B personality disorders, specifically Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The woman's constant worry and fear of being alone suggest a level of paranoia and eccentricity, which are characteristic of Cluster A personality disorders. Specifically, her tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts and her difficulty in forming and maintaining healthy relationships also support the diagnosis of Cluster A personality disorder.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the first step in cellular respiration, which is the process of generating energy from the breakdown of glucose. In glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is converted into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). This conversion releases a small amount of ATP and NADH.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis involves breaking down complex sugars, and the first step in utilizing glycogen for energy is converting it to glucose-1-phosphate. This is a crucial step as it allows the cell to utilize glycogen for energy production.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient was bitten by a dog that was acting crazy and foaming at the mouth, which are common signs of rabies infection. To prevent the development of rabies in the patient, they were given a serum that contains rabies antibodies grown inside a horse. This is an example of passive immunity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is receiving antibodies directly, which provides immediate protection against the rabies virus. This rapid response is characteristic of the body's natural immune system. However, in this case, the immunity is being provided artificially through the administration of rabies antibodies grown inside a horse. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Artificial'.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that a gas occupies 0.1L at 200atm. This means that the pressure and volume of the gas are related. When we decrease the pressure to 1atm, the volume will increase proportionally. Therefore, the correct answer is slightly more than 20L.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the pressure decreases from 200 atm to 1 atm, the volume should increase proportionally, resulting in a volume of 20 L. The correct answer is B: 20L.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Marathon running is a long-distance endurance event that requires sustained effort over an extended period of time. The key attribute in successful marathon running is stamina, which refers to the ability to sustain physical activity over a prolonged period of time. While strength and power are important for short-term high-intensity activities, they are not as critical for sustained endurance activities like marathon running.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A longer stride allows runners to cover more ground with each step, leading to greater efficiency and speed, which are crucial for success in marathons. Therefore, the key attribute is stride length.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the car must reach a velocity of 130 km/h to jump the buses. The distance of the track is 50m, which means that the acceleration required can be calculated using the equation s = ut + (1/2)at^2, where s is the displacement, u is the initial velocity, t is time and a is acceleration. Since we are only interested in finding the acceleration required to reach the desired velocity, we can simplify the equation by setting the initial velocity to 0 and solving for acceleration. This gives us the equation a = (2*s)/t^2, where s is the displacement and t is time. Plugging in the values given, we get a = (2*50m)/(10s)^2, which simplifies to a = 13 m/s^2.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To reach an average velocity of 65 km/h over 50 meters, the car would need to accelerate at a rate of 7 m/s^2. This is because the acceleration needed to achieve this velocity is directly proportional to the distance and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Triacylglycerides are a type of lipid molecule that consists of three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone. The correct answer is II, which refers to the glycerol backbone.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Triacylglycerides contain a glycerol backbone, and phospholipids, which also have a glycerol backbone, are linked by phosphodiester bonds, so it's likely that triacylglycerides also have phosphodiester linkages. Therefore, the correct answer is I and III.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. When a cell is not actively expressing a gene, it needs to condense the coding regions of that gene to make room for other important cellular processes. This process is usually achieved through histone modification, specifically histone deacetyltransferase (HDAC) activity. HDAC enzymes remove acetyl groups from histones, leading to chromatin compaction and reduced gene expression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Histone acetyltransferase activity is involved in modifying chromatin structure, and increased activity would lead to tighter DNA packing, making it less accessible for gene expression. On the other hand, histone deacetyltransferase activity is also involved in modifying chromatin structure, but decreased activity would lead to looser DNA packing, making it more accessible for gene expression. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Decrease in histone deacetyltransferase activity.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The zone of proximal development is the range of knowledge and skills that an individual can learn with guidance and support. In this case, statement C accurately describes an individual in the zone of proximal development. This is because the student is submitting a paper for review by his professor, which indicates that he needs guidance and feedback to improve his work.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The zone of proximal development refers to tasks that are just beyond an individual's current ability level but can be accomplished with guidance. In this case, the correct answer is D: A high diver takes instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move. This scenario fits perfectly within the zone of proximal development as it requires guidance and support to achieve mastery.",D

The hormone plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the fetus and supporting the development of the placenta. In this case, the correct answer is B, Endometrium, cell division.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The blastocyst is responsible for implantation and early development, and one of its key functions is to increase blood flow to the uterus. This increased blood flow helps to support the growth and development of the embryo. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Blastocyst, increase in blood flow.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. When we start exercising, our body initially relies on anaerobic energy production, which is rapid but short-lived. As the exercise continues, our body adapts and starts to rely more on aerobic energy production, which is slower but longer-lasting. According to this concept, maximal dynamic exercise becomes predominantly aerobic after approximately 1-2 minutes of intense exercise. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 1 minute.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After a short burst of intense exercise, the body quickly depletes its anaerobic energy stores and transitions to aerobic metabolism within seconds. This is because the anaerobic energy system can only sustain high-intensity exercise for a short duration before fatigue sets in. Therefore, after 30 seconds of maximal dynamic exercise, the body has already transitioned from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The disorder is X-linked recessive, which means that the gene responsible for the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, one inherited from each parent, while males have only one X chromosome. Since the disorder is recessive, a female needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) in order to express the disorder. On the other hand, a male only needs to inherit one copy of the mutated gene in order to express the disorder. Therefore, we can conclude that females will be approximately twice as affected as males in this family.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive and carried on the X chromosome, all descendants on the mother's side of the family will inherit the affected X chromosome and therefore have the disorder. This means that option A is likely true regarding the pedigree of this disorder.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The jug is 1 meter tall, and it's sitting on a countertop that's 2 meters high. This means the water level in the jug will be at an initial height of 3 meters above the ground. Since the leak is from the very bottom of the side, we can assume the water flows out of the jug at a constant rate. The volume of water flowing out per unit time (flow rate) is proportional to the pressure difference between the top and bottom of the water column. In this case, the pressure difference is due to the height difference between the water level in the jug and the ground level. Since the flow rate is proportional to the pressure difference, we can conclude that the flow rate will be directly proportional to the height of the water column above the ground. Therefore, as the water level in the jug decreases, the flow rate will also decrease.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The water will accelerate due to gravity as it falls from the jug. Using the equation v = sqrt(2gh), where h is the height of the jug (1 meter), we can calculate the velocity of the water as it exits the jug. Plugging in the values, we get v  = sqrt(2 * 9.8 m/s^2 * 1 m))  = 4.47 m/s.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The enzyme is found in a transgenic mice and participates in synthesis of an unknown product using two reactants. This suggests that the enzyme is involved in a biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, the fact that the enzyme catalyzes a process that switches a nitrogen group on one reactant to the other reactant suggests that the enzyme is a transferase. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Transferase.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the enzyme is involved in breaking a bond with the addition of a water molecule to transfer the nitrogen group, it falls under the category of hydrolases. Hydrolases are enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis reactions, which involve the cleavage of a chemical bond using water as the nucleophile.",C

The four nucleotide bases found in RNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Therefore, thymine (T) is not found in RNA.",A,"Let's reason step by step. RNA contains the nucleotide bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, so the base not found in RNA is uracil. Uracil is actually a component of DNA, not RNA.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular respiration, the process by which cells generate energy from glucose. Specifically, this enzyme catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, which is then fed into the citric acid cycle for further processing. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is involved in anaerobic metabolism and catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, regenerating NAD+ in the process. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint sports, the body undergoes intense physical stress, leading to increased production of ADP degradation products. These products include ammonia, hypoxanthine, uric acid, urea and creatinine. Among these products, ammonia, urea and uric acid are the most relevant ones that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint sports, creatine phosphate is rapidly broken down to provide energy, leading to an increase in ammonia, urea, and creatine in the blood. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of all four options: Ammonia, urea, uric acid, and creatinine.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is a naturally occurring substance found in muscle tissue that plays a crucial role in providing energy for short-duration, high-intensity activities such as weightlifting and sprinting. An expected side effect of creatine supplementation is an increase in muscle strength and power due to the increased availability of phosphocreatine, which is the primary source of energy for muscle contractions. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: muscle weakness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine supplementation can lead to increased water retention in muscles, which may cause muscle cramps due to changes in electrolyte balance and hydration status. Therefore, an expected side effect of creatine supplementation is muscle cramps.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks how several different proteins can be produced from the same gene. This is a classic example of alternative RNA splicing, where the primary transcript of the gene can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs. These different mRNAs can then be translated into different proteins.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alternative RNA splicing involves modifying the mRNA molecule after it has been transcribed from DNA, allowing different protein isoforms to be produced from the same gene. This process is crucial for generating diversity in the proteome and enabling cells to respond to changing environmental conditions.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Microtubules are dynamic structures that play a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function. MAPs, such as MAP2 and MAP tau, act to stabilize microtubules, preventing their degradation. In the mutant mouse model described, the reduced function of MAPs leads to increased microtubule degradation. Given this information, it is likely that the cellular activity most affected would be related to microtubule dynamics and stability.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Microtubules play a crucial role in intracellular transport, including the movement of transcription factors and RNA polymerase, so the cellular activity most affected would be the transcription of mRNA from DNA. This is because microtubules are involved in the transport of transcription factors to the promoter region of genes, where they bind to specific DNA sequences to initiate gene transcription.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated when a motor neuron releases acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the surface of the muscle fiber, leading to an influx of calcium ions into the muscle fiber. Calcium binding to troponin and tropomyosin triggers the contraction of the muscle fiber. Therefore, the correct answer is B: calcium binding to tropomyosin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated by the binding of potassium ions to myosin heads, which triggers a conformational change and allows for cross-bridge formation with actin filaments. This leads to muscle contraction.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Skeletal muscle is composed of muscle fibers that are responsible for contraction. The two principal contractile proteins found in skeletal muscle are actin and myosin. Actin forms the thin filaments, while myosin forms the thick filaments. These two types of filaments interact with each other to produce muscle contraction.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The two main proteins responsible for muscle contraction are myosin, which forms the thick filaments, and tropomyosin, which regulates the interaction between actin and myosin. Actin is a protein that forms thin filaments in muscles. Troponin is not directly involved in muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is B: actin and myosin.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The original RNA strand produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells. The modified sequence is similar to the original, but with some changes. Given that the modification is not drastic, it's likely that the resulting protein will be similar in size and function to the original protein. Therefore, the most likely outcome of this modification is production of a similar-sized but possibly dysfunctional protein.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A single nucleotide change in the RNA sequence will likely disrupt the reading frame and introduce a premature stop codon, leading to the absence of the protein. Therefore, the most likely outcome is the absence of the protein.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Type I muscle fibers are characterized as being white, glycolytic, and slow contracting. This is because they rely heavily on anaerobic metabolism to generate energy during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Type I muscle fibers are known for their white appearance, reliance on glycolytic metabolism, and slow-contracting properties, making them well-suited for endurance activities. Therefore, the correct answer is A: white, glycolytic, slow contracting.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sound technician needs to change the frequency of the gunshot to more accurately reflect the normal speed of sound. The normal speed of sound is approximately 343 meters per second (m/s). Since the car is traveling at 108 km/h, we can convert this to m/s: 108 km/h * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 30 m/s. The platform is also moving at 72 km/h, which is equivalent to 20 m/s. Therefore, the relative speed between the car and the platform is 10 m/s (30 m/s - 20 m/s). Since the normal speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s, we can calculate the perceived frequency as follows: Perceived frequency = Normal frequency * (Relative speed / Normal speed) = 800 Hz * (10 m/s / 343 m/s) ≈ 941 Hz. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 941 Hz.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the perceived frequency, we need to consider the relative velocity between the source and observer. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract their velocities and use the Doppler effect equation to calculate the perceived frequency. The formula is: f_p = f_s * sqrt((1 + v_s/c) / (1 - v_s/c))), where f_p is the perceived frequency, f_s is the source frequency, v_s is the velocity of the source, c is the speed of sound, and we are given that f_s = 800 Hz, v_s = 108 km/h, and c = 343 m/s. Plugging in these values, we get: f_p = 800 * sqrt((1 + (108/3.43)) / (1 - (108/3.43)))) = 941 Hz.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The transmembrane protein is composed of four different amino acids in varying quantity. This suggests that the protein has a specific structure and function. Given this information, we can infer that the most likely amino acid to be inside the transmembrane domain is tyrosine. This is because tyrosine is a hydrophobic amino acid, which means it is not polar and does not have a charge. As such, it is well-suited for being embedded in the non-polar environment of the transmembrane domain.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in the protein and its small size allows it to easily fit within the hydrophobic environment of the transmembrane domain. Therefore, glycine is the most likely amino acid to be found inside the transmembrane domain.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle lactate production increases when there is a high demand for energy and oxygen is not readily available to meet that demand. This occurs during intense or prolonged exercise, such as sprinting or distance running. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D: glycolysis is activated at the onset of exercise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle lactate production increases when oxygen is readily available, as it allows for efficient conversion of pyruvate to lactate through aerobic metabolism. However, if oxygen is not readily available, anaerobic metabolism takes over, and muscle lactate production increases as a result.",D

The second scientist's argument is based on the idea that advantages each organism possesses are absent for a long time, randomly occurred, and when they were beneficial, that organism would rapidly populate the population over a short period of time, evolutionarily speaking. To strengthen this argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the idea that advantages can emerge suddenly and then spread rapidly through a population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second scientist's theory aligns with the idea that acquired traits, like learned behaviors, can be passed down to offspring, leading to rapid changes in a population. Therefore, a study that shows long periods of stagnant growth followed by short bursts of massive evolution would strengthen the second scientist's argument.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fatigue in high intensity exercise is a common phenomenon that can be attributed to various factors. One fundamental cause of fatigue is the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. During high-intensity exercise, the muscle cells require a rapid and sustained release of ATP to fuel their contractions. However, the rate at which ATP is produced by the mitochondria may not be able to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demands for ATP during high-intensity exercise. As a result, fatigue sets in as the muscle cells are unable to sustain the high levels of contraction required to maintain the desired level of performance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body rapidly uses ATP for energy, leading to a depletion of ADP, which is essential for ATP production. As a result, fatigue sets in due to the inability of the muscles to generate sufficient force or power. Therefore, the correct answer is C: failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. Proteins are long chains of amino acids linked together through covalent bonds. The type of bond that links the amino acids in a protein is called a peptide bond. This bond forms between the carboxyl group (-COOH) of one amino acid and the amino group (-NH2) of another amino acid.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteins are complex carbohydrates, and glycosidic bonds are responsible for linking the individual sugar units together to form the protein chain.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about a phenomenon where people from the same nationality or cultural background gather in small areas within a larger city, and maintain customs and traditions from their prior country of inhabitance. This phenomenon can be described as a microculture, which is a smaller group within a larger culture that maintains its own distinct identity and practices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The example of Little Italy demonstrates a counterculture because the cheek-kissing custom is in direct opposition to the typical greeting norms of the larger New York City culture. Additionally, this counterculture phenomenon is not necessarily a subculture or microculture because it does not have its own distinct identity or set of customs that are separate from the larger culture.",B

This can be done through genetic engineering or gene therapy techniques.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. For very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is from phosphocreatine stores. This is because creatine phosphorylation provides a rapid and efficient way to replenish ATP stores during high-intensity activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: phycocreatine stores.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For short bursts of intense activity, the body relies on creatine phosphorylation to quickly generate ATP, which provides the necessary energy. This process is particularly important for high-intensity activities that require rapid muscle contractions, such as weightlifting or sprinting.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The coding sequences of genes are the parts of DNA that contain the instructions for making proteins. These sequences are called exons, which are the parts of a gene's DNA sequence that are actually translated into protein. Therefore, the correct answer is B: exons.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Codons are the segments of DNA that directly code for the amino acid sequence of a protein, therefore they are the coding sequences of genes.

A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body's energy demands increase significantly. To meet these increased energy demands, the body breaks down stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is known as glycogenolysis. As a result of this process, blood glucose concentrations typically rise during high-intensity exercise. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: frequently rises by 1 - 3 mM.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on fat for fuel, leading to a decrease in blood glucose levels as it is spared. Additionally, during intense exercise, the liver releases stored glucose (glycogen) into the bloodstream, which also contributes to an increase in blood glucose levels. Therefore, it is unlikely that blood glucose concentrations would frequently rise by 1-3 mM or fall by 1-3 mM during high-intensity exercise. Instead, blood glucose concentrations are likely to remain relatively unchanged or fluctuate within a narrow range.",B

The reaction can be represented as: HCl + Mg(OH)2 → MgCl2 + 2H2O. Since the concentration of HCl is higher than that of OH- ions, the reaction will proceed until all the OH- ions are consumed. At this point, the solution will become saturated with respect to Mg(OH)2 and MgCl2, but not with respect to HCl. Therefore, option C is correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Adding HCl to a saturated solution of Mg(OH)2 will increase the concentration of Cl- ions, exceeding the solubility product of MgCl2 and causing it to precipitate out of the solution. Therefore, option A is correct.",A

As the intensity of exercise increases, the body relies more heavily on anaerobic energy production. This is because anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP quickly and efficiently, even in the absence of oxygen. In contrast, aerobic metabolism requires oxygen to generate ATP, and is therefore less effective at high intensities. Therefore, as the intensity of exercise increases, the proportional contribution of anaerobic energy production will increase, while the proportional contribution of aerobic energy production will decrease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As exercise intensity increases, the body relies more on aerobic metabolism, and the TCA cycle plays a crucial role in generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, as exercise intensity increases, the proportional contribution of aerobic energy production to total energy expenditure also increases.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is a naturally occurring substance found in muscle tissue. It plays a crucial role in providing energy to muscles during high-intensity activities such as weightlifting, sprinting, and jumping. Creatine is synthesized from amino acids in the liver, not directly from creatinine in the kidneys. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 'amino acids in the muscles.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine is primarily used in muscle tissue for energy production, so it makes sense that it would be synthesized from amino acids within the muscles themselves. This process occurs through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that ultimately result in the formation of creatine.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water indicates that as the temperature increases, the density of water decreases. This is because the molecules of water are moving faster and farther apart as the temperature increases, resulting in a decrease in density.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Water is denser in its liquid form than as ice. This means that under low-pressure conditions, the solid ice will readily melt and transition to the liquid phase. Therefore, the correct answer is D: H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under low pressure conditions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In glycolysis, the net production of ATP is a result of substrate-level phosphorylation. This process occurs when one molecule of glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate. During this conversion, three high-energy phosphate bonds are generated, which are then used to produce three molecules of ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is 3 from glucose and no contribution from glycogen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis involves several steps of phosphorylation, resulting in a net production of 3 ATP molecules from glucose and 4 ATP molecules from glycogen. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that mistakes are coded into the leading strand about once every 100,000/1 million copies. This suggests that the error rate is relatively low. Furthermore, the question mentions that several mechanisms are involved in proofreading and correcting errors. Given these facts, it is most likely that the repair mechanism responsible for removing the incorrect base is the mismatch repair mechanism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for identifying and correcting errors shortly after DNA replication, including the removal of incorrect bases that were incorporated during the process. Therefore, if a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed, this would most likely be the work of the mismatch repair mechanism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. FADH2 and NADH+H are electron carriers that play a crucial role in cellular respiration, the process of generating energy from glucose. When these electron carriers donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, they release a significant amount of free energy. This free energy is then used to drive the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. The number of ATP molecules synthesized per cycle of the electron transport chain depends on the type of electron carrier involved. FADH2 and NADH+H are both involved in the electron transport chain, but they have different roles and contribute differently to the overall process. In this case, the correct answer is 2 ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Each FADH2 molecule can contribute to the production of 2 ATP, and each NADH+H molecule can contribute to the production of 3 ATP, so together they can generate a total of 3 ATP. The correct answer is D: 3 ATP.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks what our genetic material is made up of. We know that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms. Therefore, the correct answer is A: deoxyribonucleic acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. RNA is the primary genetic material responsible for carrying and transmitting genetic information within cells. DNA, on the other hand, is a secondary genetic material that contains the instructions for the development and function of an organism. Therefore, the correct answer is A: deoxyribonucleic acid.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the effect of low carbohydrate intake on exercise performance. Low carbohydrate intake means that the body will rely more heavily on fat for energy, which can impair high-intensity exercise performance. Therefore, the correct answer is C: may impair high intensity exercise performance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Carbohydrates are primarily used for endurance activities, so a low-carbohydrate diet would not have a significant impact on exercise performance in events lasting less than 10 minutes. However, it's important to note that a low-carbohydrate diet may impair high-intensity exercise performance and increase the reliance on muscle glycogen during exercise.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's behavior, such as agitation and aggression, suggests that they may be experiencing a state of hyperdopaminergia. This means that there is an overactivation of the dopamine system in the brain. As a result, the patient may experience symptoms such as increased energy, excitement, or euphoria, which can contribute to their agitated behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's symptoms suggest a disruption in dopamine signaling, likely due to seizure-like activity in brain regions associated with dopamine production and regulation. This is consistent with option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is a type of smooth endoplasmic reticulum found in muscle cells. Its primary function is to store and release calcium ions, which play a crucial role in muscle contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'store of calcium ions.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sarcoplasmic reticulum is involved in muscle contraction, and muscle contraction relies on the movement of sodium ions to generate action potentials. Therefore, it's not a store of digestive enzymes, sodium ions, lipid, or calcium ions. The correct answer is that it acts as a store of calcium ions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Both meiosis and mitosis are types of cell division. In both cases, the cell goes through a series of stages: G0 (quiescent phase), G1 (growth phase), S (synthesis phase), G2 (gap phase) before entering mitosis or meiosis. Therefore, phases I, II, and III are common to cells undergoing meiosis and mitosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both meiosis and mitosis involve periods of cell growth and DNA replication, so phases G0 and G2 must be common to both processes. Additionally, the S phase is also a common phase in both meiosis and mitosis, as it involves DNA replication. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler shift is a phenomenon that occurs when an object moves relative to an observer. In order to determine the Doppler shift in perceived sound frequency, we need to know four variables: I. speed of sound in medium; II. Time of interaction between sound source and detector; III. distance between source and detector; IV. frequency of emitted sound. Therefore, the correct answer is D: I and IV.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Doppler effect is about how sound changes as it travels, so we need to know the distance between the source and detector to account for sound wave spreading and attenuation. Additionally, knowing the speed of sound in the medium (air or water) is crucial because it affects the frequency shift. Finally, knowing the time of interaction between the sound source and detector helps us calculate the Doppler shift. Therefore, the correct answer is B: I and III.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The original DNA sequence is 5\u2019  \u2013 GGATCCTCATG  \u2013 3\u2019. A point mutation would change one nucleotide to another, and a deletion would remove one or more nucleotides from the sequence. Therefore, we need to identify which of the given DNA segments is the result of both a point mutation and a deletion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A deletion means a significant portion of the DNA sequence is removed, so the resulting segment should be much shorter than the original. On the other hand, a point mutation means a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is changed, which would not significantly affect the overall length of the DNA sequence. Therefore, we can conclude that the result of this original DNA sequence experiencing both a point mutation and a deletion would be a segment with a much shorter length than the original.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is exhibiting a sense of entitlement, grandiosity, and an exaggerated sense of self-importance. These are all characteristic features of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). Additionally, the patient's reaction to being told he would have to see the hygienist instead of the dentist suggests that he may be experiencing feelings of rage, humiliation, and shame, which are also common in individuals with NPD.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The patient is clearly seeking attention with his outburst and wants to be the center of focus, which aligns with the characteristics of histrionic personality disorder. Additionally, the patient's behavior is also consistent with narcissistic personality disorder, as he seems to have an inflated sense of self-importance and entitlement. However, based on the information provided, I would lean towards a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The electron transport chain is responsible for generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. This process involves the movement of H+ ions across the mitochondrial membrane, which creates a proton gradient. This gradient is then used to drive the production of ATP through the process of chemiosmosis. Therefore, the mechanism by which H+ returns to the inside of the mitochondria is known as passive transport.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The H+ ions move from an area of high concentration to low concentration across the membrane, so it must be a process of passive diffusion. This is because there is no energy input required for this process, unlike active transport which requires energy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. An action potential is a brief, self-propagating change in the electrical properties of an excitable cell such as a neuron. The flow of sodium into the neuron depolarizes the membrane in the first phase of an action potential. This is not one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. Instead, hyperpolarization at the end of an action potential is one mechanism by which neurons limit the rate at which action potentials may fire. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperpolarization makes the neuron more negative, which makes it harder to reach the threshold for an action potential, thus limiting the firing rate. This is not one of the mechanisms mentioned in options B, C, or D.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. DNA is a molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms. The building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, which consist of three components: a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Since amino acids are not part of the structure of DNA, option D is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ribose is a sugar molecule involved in nucleic acid structure, and since DNA is a nucleic acid, ribose must be a part of it. Purines (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine) are the building blocks of nucleotides, which make up DNA. Therefore, purines, pyrimidines, and deoxyribose are all parts of DNA. Amino acids, on the other hand, are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic instructions encoded in an organism's DNA. This includes all the genes, regulatory elements, and other functional regions that make up an organism's genetic makeup. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'the entire DNA sequence of an organism.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic material, which is organized into chromosomes, so it must be the number of chromosomes in somatic cells. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A ventricular septal defect is a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. This means that there is a direct communication between the right atrium and the left ventricle, bypassing the pulmonary circulation. As a result, oxygen-rich blood from the right atrium can flow directly into the left ventricle, increasing the amount of oxygen in the left ventricle. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The percentage of oxygen in the left atrium would be lower.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If there's a hole between the ventricles, some deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle will mix with the oxygenated blood in the left atrium, lowering the oxygen percentage. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP without the involvement of oxygen. This type of metabolism is typically seen in high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. In these situations, the body relies on anaerobic energy production to generate the necessary ATP.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Anaerobic metabolism means there's no oxygen available, so the body must rely on glycogen stores for energy production. This process does not involve ADP or ATP directly, but rather relies on the breakdown of glycogen to produce pyruvate, which is then converted into lactate.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that plays a crucial role in muscle function, particularly during high-intensity exercise. When muscles contract rapidly and repeatedly, phosphocreatine is broken down into creatine and phosphate groups. This process is reversible, meaning that the energy stored in phosphocreatine can be replenished after exercise. The rate at which this replenishment occurs depends on various factors, including the intensity and duration of exercise, as well as individual differences in muscle fiber composition and other physiological characteristics. In general, high-intensity exercise tends to deplete phosphocreatine stores more rapidly than lower-intensity exercise. As a result, it may take longer for phosphocreatine levels to recover after high-intensity exercise compared to lower-intensity exercise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is used for quick bursts of energy, so its resynthesis should be relatively fast, likely within seconds. The correct answer is A: about 10 seconds.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. When a sound wave exits one medium and enters another, the frequency of the sound remains constant. The velocity of the sound changes due to the change in density of the media. Intensity is related to the square of the amplitude of the wave, which does not change when the wave passes from one medium to another. Wavelength also remains constant as the wave travels through different media. Therefore, the correct answer is D: wavelength.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Wavelength is a fundamental property of a sound wave and doesn't change regardless of the medium it's traveling through. The other options, velocity, intensity, frequency, are all affected when a sound wave changes mediums.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which method is NOT good for restricting caloric intake. Methods A, B, and D are all related to controlling or limiting food intake in some way. Method C, on the other hand, is unrelated to food intake at all - it's about snapping a rubber band around one's wrist. Therefore, method C is the correct answer as it is not a good method for restricting caloric intake.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A health smoothie store offers healthier options than a coffee shop, making it a better environment for studying and maintaining focus on his weight loss goals. Therefore, option A is NOT a good method to restrict his caloric intake.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Karen's therapist has been helping her develop a stronger sense of self-esteemed and self-efficacy. This means that the therapist would likely encourage Karen to take on challenges, build confidence, and develop problem-solving skills. Therefore, option D: 'Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in.' would NOT be a strategy that her therapist would ask her to employ.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Building self-efficacy involves gaining confidence through positive feedback and encouragement, so seeking positive feedback from friends is a crucial strategy. The other options are also important strategies for building self-efficacy, but they do not involve seeking positive feedback from others.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the synthesis of glucose from various sources. This process is called gluconeogenesis, which is a vital metabolic pathway that generates glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glycerol, and amino acids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate sources involves breaking down fats, which is the process of lipolysis. However, this process does not directly synthesize glucose. Instead, it releases glycerol and fatty acids into the bloodstream. The liver then converts these molecules into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. Therefore, the correct answer is D: gluconeogenesis.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that rational choice theory is premised on the concept that actions are chosen based on the benefit to the individual. This implies that the theory assumes that individuals make decisions rationally, considering all available options and choosing the one that maximizes their utility or satisfaction. In this context, the three main assumptions of rational theory - completeness, transitivity, and independence of variables - can be seen as logical extensions of the fundamental assumption of rational choice theory.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Independence of variables suggests that individuals make choices based on their own preferences without external pressures, which aligns with a matriarchal system where women hold power and make independent decisions. The other options do not accurately describe the concept of independence of variables in rational choice theory.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. During muscular contraction, the power stroke is the process where myosin heads bind to actin filaments and then undergo a conformational change, resulting in the shortening of the sarcomere. However, this process requires ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, another process that requires ATP during muscle contraction is the binding and release of myosin heads from actin filaments, which is necessary for the sliding filament mechanism to occur.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves myosin pulling on actin filaments, and this interaction requires energy from ATP to initiate the movement. In addition to the power stroke, another process that requires ATP is muscle relaxation. During muscle relaxation, the myosin heads detach from the actin filaments, and the muscle returns to its resting length. This detachment also requires energy from ATP.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism within muscle cells. The activity of creatine kinase is directly related to the concentration of ADP and ATP within the cell. When intracellular ADP rises, it binds to creatine kinase, activating its enzymatic activity. This results in the conversion of ADP to ATP, which helps to restore cellular energy homeostasis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Enzymes are sensitive to pH changes, and a lower pH usually reduces their activity, so creatine kinase activity would decrease when muscle pH falls. Additionally, creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism within the muscles, particularly during high-intensity activities. Therefore, its activity would increase when intracellular ADP rises, which is a common occurrence during intense exercise.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration, where glucose is converted into pyruvate. The enzymes involved in glycolysis are located in the cytoplasm, not in any other organelle such as mitochondria, nucleus, lysosomes, etc.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is part of cellular respiration, and cellular respiration takes place in the mitochondria, so the enzymes must be located there. The other options are incorrect because glycolysis does not occur in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or lysosomes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The cell cycle is a complex process that involves the replication of DNA and the separation of chromosomes. Prior to the restriction point (R), the cell has not yet committed to dividing. At this stage, the cell still has the option to exit the cell cycle or continue through the cycle. Therefore, prior to the restriction point (R), the cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes, which is a total of 46 chromosomes and 92 chromatids.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Before the restriction point, the cell has not yet duplicated its genetic material, so it should have half the number of chromosomes and chromatids it will have after division. Since a normal human somatic cell has 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total), before the restriction point, the cell would have 23 chromosomes and 23 chromatids.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold for hearing is the minimum intensity of sound that a person can detect. In this case, we are told that at 80% power, 20 mice pressed the lever. At 70% power, 15 mice pressed the lever. At 60% power, 10 mice pressed the lever. This suggests that as the power level decreases, fewer mice press the lever. Therefore, it is likely that the absolute threshold for hearing in this case corresponds to the lowest power level at which a significant number of mice still press the lever. In other words, it is likely that the absolute threshold for hearing in this case corresponds to 60% power.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the minimum stimulus needed for detection, so it should correspond to the power level where the most mice, 20 in this case, reacted to the bell. This means that the absolute threshold corresponds to 80% power.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, and this energy is provided by ATP (adenosine triphosphate). When a muscle contracts, it uses up some of its stored ATP, which is then replenished through cellular respiration. Therefore, the correct answer is A: ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy molecule stored in muscles and is used to quickly regenerate ATP during intense exercise.

The teenager has committed a series of taboo acts, including consensual sexual intercourse with his sister, non-consensual sexual relations with an unknown woman, and vomiting on the steps to the door of a local church. These acts are considered taboo because they violate societal norms and expectations. Therefore, the correct answer is D: taboo, folkways, the law, and mores.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The teenager's actions primarily involve breaking laws and violating common courtesy, so the order of violations should be based on legal consequences and social faux pas.

C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise. The energy expenditure can be calculated using the following formula: Energy Expenditure (EE) = VO2 x RQ, where VO2 is the volume of oxygen consumed and RQ is the respiratory quotient. Since we are given that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/min for 5 minutes of exercise, we can calculate the total volume of oxygen consumed as follows: Total Volume of Oxygen Consumed = VO2 x Time = 3.0 l/min x 5 min = 15.0 l. The respiratory quotient (RQ) is typically around 0.8-1.0 for most exercises. Let's assume an RQ of 0.9 for this exercise. Now, we can calculate the energy expenditure as follows: Energy Expenditure (EE) = VO2 x RQ = 15.0 l x 0.9 = 13.5 kJ. Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 13.5 kJ.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the athlete consumes 3 liters of oxygen per minute, then over 5 minutes, they would consume 15 liters, which is equivalent to 15,000 milliliters. With an energy equivalent of approximately 20 kJ per liter of oxygen, the total energy expenditure would be around 500 kJ. However, since we are given that the athlete's steady-rate oxygen uptake averages 3.0 l/minute for 5 minutes of exercise, and not the total amount of oxygen consumed, we need to calculate the energy expenditure based on the rate at which oxygen is being consumed.",D

A,"Let's reason step by step. MERRF is a rare disorder that affects neuromuscular systems due to a mutation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). When an affected male and a normal female reproduce, the offspring will inherit the mutated mtDNA from their father.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The creatine kinase reaction is a reversible reaction that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. This reaction is not inhibited by low pH in the muscle, which means it can occur even under conditions of acidosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Most enzymatic reactions, especially those involved in energy metabolism, are irreversible to ensure a unidirectional flow of energy. Therefore, the creatine kinase reaction should also be irreversible. This eliminates options B and C. Furthermore, option D is incorrect because low pH in muscle tissue would actually inhibit the activity of creatine kinase, not activate it. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 'irreversible'.""",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen ions are formed when the pH of a solution decreases, typically due to an increase in hydrogen ion concentration. In this case, the most likely answer is that pyruvate is converted to lactate, which would result in an increase in hydrogen ion concentration and a decrease in pH.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. When a molecule is completely oxidized in the body, it releases energy in the form of ATP. The amount of energy released depends on the molecular structure and the number of bonds broken during oxidation. Among the options provided, one gram of glucose (A) releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. This is because glucose is a simple sugar that can be easily converted into pyruvate through glycolysis, releasing a significant amount of ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the body's main source of energy and is efficiently metabolized through cellular respiration, so it should release the most energy per gram when completely oxidized. In contrast, palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid that requires more energy to break down and metabolize, so it would release less energy per gram when completely oxidized. Similarly, leucine is an amino acid that requires energy to be broken down and metabolized, so it would also release less energy per gram when completely oxidized. Finally, alcohol is a type of sugar that can be metabolized by the body for energy, but it is not as efficient at releasing energy as glucose, so it would release less energy per gram when completely oxidized.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The pKb of a solution is related to its pH, but it's not exactly equal to the pOH. The correct relationship between pKb and pOH is that pKb is lower than pOH. Therefore, for a very weak base, the pKb would likely be lower than the pOH.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For a weak base, the pKb and pOH should be equal, reflecting the balance between the base and its conjugate acid in the solution. Therefore, for a very weak base, the pKb of a solution would likely be equal to the pOH.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When the body is exposed to increased environmental temperature, it needs to compensate for this change. One of the ways the body does this is by increasing its respiration rate. This allows the body to take in more oxygen and release more carbon dioxide, which helps to regulate body temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is B: increasing respiration rate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When the environmental temperature rises, the body needs to work harder to maintain its core temperature. This increased workload requires more blood flow, leading to an increased heart rate. Additionally, the body also increases respiration rate to help remove excess heat from the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C: increasing heart rate.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The lining of the digestive tract and the respiratory tract are both epithelial tissues that develop from the endoderm germ layer. Therefore, the correct answer is I only.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mesoderm is responsible for forming many internal structures, including muscles and connective tissues, which are often closely associated with the linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts. Therefore, it is most likely that the lining of these tracts develops from the mesoderm.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body's energy demands increase rapidly. The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during this period is through phosphocreatine breakdown. This process is extremely rapid and can replenish ATP stores in a matter of seconds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During exercise, the body needs a rapid supply of glucose to fuel muscle contractions. Glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, provides this readily available glucose. However, this process is relatively slow compared to other mechanisms that can rapidly resynthesize ATP during intense exercise. The most rapid method to resynthesize ATP during exercise is through phosphocreatine breakdown.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Human somatic cells are non-reproductive cells that make up most of the human body. These cells have a specific number of chromosomes, which is determined by the species. In humans, all somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes, except for gametes (sperm and egg cells), which contain 23 chromosomes each. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 46.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, one set from each parent. Therefore, each somatic cell, containing a full set of chromosomes, would have 3 chromosomes in total. However, this is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. The correct answer is C, which states that all human somatic cells contain 46 chromosomes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sport is a complex phenomenon that involves multiple factors. While physical attributes such as strength, speed, and agility are important, they are not the only determining factor. Other factors such as mental toughness, motivation, and strategy also play a crucial role in achieving success in sport. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that success in sport is solely determined by physical attributes or innate ability.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Success in sports requires not only physical training but also mental acuity and the drive to excel. High intelligence allows for strategic thinking and quick decision-making, while motivation fuels perseverance and dedication. A good coach can provide guidance, support, and constructive feedback, helping athletes refine their skills and reach their full potential. Innate ability refers to an individual's natural talents or aptitudes, which can be nurtured and developed through training and practice.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The study is set up to test the effect of a sweet on people's behavior. The results show that individuals who take a sweet are twice as likely to use the longer hallway than individuals who refuse the sweet. This suggests that the sweet has an influence on people's behavior, and this influence can be measured.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of the cookies introduces an additional choice for the participants, potentially overwhelming them with options and leading to a state of decision fatigue. This is consistent with the concept of 'Tyranny of Choice', which suggests that having too many choices can lead to feelings of anxiety, indecision, and ultimately, decreased well-being.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups refer to sites on an enzyme molecule where a cofactor or coenzyme binds, allowing the enzyme to function properly. These prosthetic groups can be tightly bound to the enzyme and are required for its activity. Therefore, the correct answer is D: tightly bound to enzymes and are required for their activity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are often small organic molecules that assist enzymes in their function. These molecules are typically held in place by weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, allowing for flexibility and dynamic binding. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The descending loop of Henle is a part of the nephron, which is responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. The descending loop of Henle is permeable to water (H2O) because it helps to reabsorb water back into the bloodstream. Therefore, the correct answer is B: H2O.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The descending loop of Henle is primarily responsible for concentrating the filtrate by reabsorbing water. Potassium ions are also involved in maintaining the osmotic balance within the nephron, making them likely to be permeable in this region. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is potassium ions.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The second shock is characterized as having a similar response to the first, which means that it also causes depolarization of the membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is Depolarization.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The initial sharp rise in membrane potential indicates depolarization. The subsequent lack of response to the second stimulation suggests that the neurons have returned to their resting state, which is characteristic of repolarization. However, when the scientist increases the amount of voltage supplied to the second shock, the neurons respond again, indicating hyperpolarization.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of creating a protein from a sequence of nucleotides in an mRNA molecule. This process requires the presence of three main components: mRNA, ribosomes, and transfer RNA (tRNA). The correct answer is A: 'mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation involves the decoding of mRNA into a protein sequence. This process requires mRNA as the template, ribosomes as the site of protein synthesis, and RNA polymerase to facilitate the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. Therefore, the correct answer is A: mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis is the first stage of cellular respiration, where glucose is converted into pyruvate. The rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis is the enzyme that determines the maximum rate at which glycolysis can occur. Among the options provided, phosphofructokinase (PFK) is the correct answer because it is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate-limiting step in glycolysis is the conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorylase. This step controls the overall rate of glycolysis and ensures a steady supply of glucose for energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is A: phosphorlyase.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The ATP store in muscle is a limited energy source that can only supply energy for high-intensity exercise. The duration of this energy supply depends on the intensity and duration of the exercise. In general, the ATP store can only sustain high-intensity exercise for about 2 seconds. After that, the energy supply from the ATP store becomes insufficient to maintain high-intensity exercise.",A,"Let's reason step by step. ATP stores in muscles are limited but can be rapidly replenished through various metabolic pathways. This allows for sustained high-intensity exercise for approximately 20 seconds before other energy sources become dominant. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 20 seconds.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is believed to improve middle distance running performance by buffering the increase in lactic acid that occurs during intense exercise. This buffering effect allows for a faster efflux of hydrogen ions from muscle, which in turn reduces the accumulation of lactic acid and delays the onset of fatigue. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer, helping to maintain the pH balance within the muscles. By elevating the pre-exercise muscle pH, it provides a greater capacity to neutralize the acidic byproducts of exercise, delaying fatigue. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of an object on a plane with an angle of incline, ?, is given by the equation: a = g sin ?. This equation takes into account the force due to gravity (g) and the component of that force parallel to the plane (sin ?). Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The acceleration of the object is determined by the balance between the gravitational force pulling it down the incline and the frictional force opposing its motion. This can be represented as the difference between the sine and cosine components of the gravitational force, leading to the expression a = g (sin ? - cos ?).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following statements is true. Statement A claims that increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. However, this statement is false because there is no scientific evidence to support it. On the other hand, statement B claims that creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is true because numerous studies have consistently shown that creatine supplementation can increase muscle strength and power in both healthy individuals and athletes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage typically occurs during intense exercise, especially when muscles are forced to contract while lengthening. This type of contraction, known as an eccentric contraction, places greater stress on the muscle fibers, leading to microscopic tears and subsequent muscle damage. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The individual is born with a mutation causing her to partially retain a form of fetal hemoglobin into adulthood. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which means it can bind more easily to oxygen molecules. This would result in increased oxygen binding to hemoglobin in the tissues, which is option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. This allows for efficient transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetus during pregnancy. Retaining fetal hemoglobin into adulthood would therefore result in significantly reduced oxygen binding in the lungs. This is because the retained fetal hemoglobin would have a lower affinity for oxygen, leading to reduced oxygen binding and delivery to the tissues.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and relaxation. It is stored in the muscle cell, specifically in the mitochondria. The mitochondria are often referred to as the 'powerhouses' of the cell because they generate most of the energy that the cell needs to function.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity exercise. It is primarily located within the mitochondria, where it can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP, regenerating ATP to fuel muscle contractions. Therefore, phosphocreatine is most likely found in the mitochondria.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. When oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell, the process of cellular respiration will be disrupted. In this scenario, the first molecule that will stop being produced is ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). This is because ATP production requires energy from the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen. Without oxygen, this process cannot occur and ATP production will cease.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Pyruvate is a key intermediate in cellular respiration and is produced during glycolysis, which can occur both with and without oxygen. When oxygen is no longer available, pyruvate production will cease as the cell switches to anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, pyruvate will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the energy charge of a cell. The correct answer should describe the energy charge in terms of ATP, as it is the primary source of energy for cells. Based on this understanding, option B is the most accurate description of the energy charge of a cell.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of the cell refers to the balance of ions, particularly sodium and potassium, across the cell membrane. This balance is maintained by the sodium-potassium ATPase, which actively pumps ions against their concentration gradients, generating an electrical potential difference. Therefore, the correct answer is B: generated by the sodium-potassium ATPase.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a history of substance abuse throughout adolescence, which is likely to have caused damage to the brain's executive functioning system. This system is responsible for decision-making, planning, and impulse control. Given this background, it is likely that the patient will exhibit symptoms reflecting diminished executive functioning, such as reduced behavioral impulse control. Therefore, options III and C are most likely true of this patient.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Substance abuse can have detrimental effects on brain development, particularly in regions associated with executive functions. This impairment often manifests as increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations, as the brain struggles to filter and interpret sensory information accurately. Additionally, substance abuse can also lead to reduced behavioral impulse control, as the brain's ability to regulate emotions and behaviors is impaired. Therefore, options I, III are likely true of this patient.",C
