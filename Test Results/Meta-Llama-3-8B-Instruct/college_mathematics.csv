We know that the ladder is leaning against a vertical wall on level ground, and as the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, the top end slides downward along the wall. At any given moment, we can draw a right triangle with the ladder being the hypotenuse, the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and the point where it touches the ground being one leg, and the height above the ground at that moment being the other leg. We know that the rate at which the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall is 2 meters per second, so we can use this information to find the rate at which the top end of the ladder slides downward along the wall. Let's call the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and the point where it touches the ground 'x'. Then, as the bottom end of the ladder is moved away from the wall at a constant rate of 2 meters per second, we can write an equation for the position of the bottom end of the ladder in terms of time: x = 2t. We know that when t = 0, x = 0 (i.e., the bottom end of the ladder is initially touching the ground). Therefore, we can substitute t = 0 into our equation to find the value of x at this moment: x = 2(0) = 0. This means that when t = 0, the distance between the bottom end of the ladder and the point where it touches the ground is 0 meters.",-,"Let's reason step by step. We know the rate of change of the angle between the ladder and the ground is 2 meters per second, so we can use trigonometry to relate this to the rate of change of the height.

Now, differentiating both sides with respect to 't', we get: -18h + 2h^2 = 8t. At the moment when the top end is 3 meters above the ground, we know that h = 6. Substituting this value into the equation above, we can solve for t and find the rate of change of the height at that moment.",B
