    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 says that if a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. This is because the order of an element in a group is equal to the smallest positive integer n such that a^n = e, where e is the identity element of the group.",-,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 due to the existence of inverses and the closure property. Furthermore, if it has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 due to the structure of cyclic subgroups. Therefore, both statements are true.",A

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 says that every function from a finite set onto itself must be one to one. This is true because if the function were not one to one, then there would exist two distinct elements in the domain that get mapped to the same element in the codomain. But this would contradict the fact that the function is onto.",-,"Let's reason step by step. Since every function from a finite set onto itself is bijective, it must also be one-to-one. Similarly, every subgroup of an abelian group inherits the abelian property, making it abelian as well. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 says that every permutation is a one-to-one function. This means that for any two distinct elements in the set, their corresponding images under the permutation are also distinct. Statement 2 says that every function is a permutation if and only if it is one-to-one. This means that if a function is one-to-one, then it must be a permutation, because it satisfies the condition of being one-to-one. Conversely, if a function is not one-to-one, then it cannot be a permutation, because it does not satisfy the condition of being one-to-one.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Every permutation is a one-to-one function by definition. Additionally, every function that is one-to-one is also a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 states that Q is an extension field of Z_2. This means that every element in Q can be expressed as a polynomial over Z_2 with coefficients from Q. Statement 2 states that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is true because if we consider the polynomial f(x) = x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0, where n > 0 and a_i are elements of the field F, then by the fundamental theorem of algebra, f(x) has at least one zero in some extension field. Since Q is an extension field of Z_2, we can conclude that every non-constant polynomial over Z_2 has a zero in Q.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q contains elements that are not in Z_2, it is an extension field of Z_2. Moreover, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in that same field, as fields are algebraically closed. Therefore, the statements are both true.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 says that if aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. This statement is true because in a factor group, each equivalence class represents a coset of the subgroup H. Therefore, |aH| is the size of this equivalence class, which must divide the size of the original set, |a|. Statement 2 says that if H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G. This statement is also true because HK is the set of all products ahk where a is in H and k is in K. Since both H and K are subgroups of G, it follows that ahk is an element of G for any a in H and k in K. Therefore, HK is indeed a subgroup of G.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Therefore, if aH is an element of a factor group, its order must divide the order of a. Additionally, the product of any two subgroups H and K of a group G is always a subgroup of G. This can be proved by showing that the identity element e is in HK, and that for any elements h1 in H and k1 in K, there exist elements h2 in H and k2 in K such that h1k1 = h2k2.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 says that if G, H and K are groups of order 4, at least two of them are isomorphic. This statement is true because a group of order 4 can be represented as Z_2 x Z_2 or Z_4. Since both representations have the same number of elements (4), they must be isomorphic. Statement 2 says that if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n. This statement is also true because an isomorphism between two groups preserves the structure of the group, including the order of its elements. Therefore, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then we can conclude that r divides m and s divides n.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic. Additionally, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n due to the properties of direct sums. Therefore, both statements are true.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given a polynomial x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x]. To factor this polynomial, we need to find the roots of the polynomial. Since the polynomial is in Z_5[x], the possible values for the roots are 0, 1, 2, and 3. By trial and error, we can find that one of the roots is x = 2. Therefore, we can factor out (x - 2) from the original polynomial. This gives us (x - 2)(x^3 + 2x). We can further factor the cubic term by using the rational root theorem. By trial and error, we can find that one of the roots is x = 1. Therefore, we can factor out (x - 1) from the original polynomial. This gives us (x - 2)(x^3 + 2x) = (x - 2)(x - 1)^3. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: (x-1)(x+1)^3.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite x^4 + 4 as (x^4 - 1) + 5, which factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + 5. In Z_5, this further simplifies to (x-1)^3(x+1) due to the properties of modular arithmetic. Therefore, the correct factorization is (x-1)^3(x+1).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. This implies that g is injective because if g(x) = g(y), then we have x = g^(-1)(g(x))) = g^(-1)(g(y)))) = y. Now, let's consider the statement 'The function g must necessarily be surjective.' We can prove this by contradiction. Suppose g is not surjective. Then there exists some b in B such that there is no a in A for which g(a) = b. But then we have f(A) subseteq B, and since f is onto (by assumption), we have f(A) = B. This implies that there must be an a in A for which g(a) = b, which contradicts our initial assumption that g is not surjective. Therefore, we conclude that the statement 'The function g must necessarily be surjective.' is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means that g 'undoes' the action of f, implying that g must be both injective and surjective. Therefore, Statement 1 is True, and Statement 2 is also True.",A
