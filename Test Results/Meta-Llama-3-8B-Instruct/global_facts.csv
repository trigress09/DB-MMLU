C,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2019, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that fossil fuels accounted for about 64% of total electricity generation in the country. This means that out of every 100 units of electricity generated in the US as of 2019, approximately 64 units came from fossil fuels.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the growing emphasis on renewable energy like solar and wind power, fossil fuels must constitute a smaller portion of electricity generation. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2019, about 23% of electricity came from fossil fuels in the United States.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people from Russia who think homosexuality should be accepted by society. We can find this information in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2019. According to the survey, 72% of Russians believe that same-sex relationships should not be accepted by society. This means that 28% of Russians believe that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society. Therefore, we can conclude that about 28% of people from Russia say that homosexuality should be accepted by society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing global acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, it's likely that a significant portion of the Russian population also supports these rights. However, Russia has been known for its conservative views on social issues, including LGBTQ+ rights. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the percentage of people from Russia who support accepting homosexuality is lower than in other countries with more progressive attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, the urban population in India is approximately 34% according to the World Bank. This means that about one-third of the Indian population lives in urban areas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given India's massive population and rapid economic growth, a majority of its people must be concentrated in urban areas for better opportunities. According to the United Nations, as of 2017, about 34% of Indians live in urban areas. This is a significant increase from previous years, indicating that more and more Indians are moving to cities for better living conditions and economic opportunities.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of US adults who say that criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision making. According to a survey conducted in 2018, about 56% of US adults said that criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision making.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As technology advances, people are generally becoming more comfortable with algorithms making decisions, including in the justice system. However, there is still a significant portion of the population that is skeptical about the use of algorithms in decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters as serious as criminal justice. Therefore, I would expect around 41% of US adults to say that criminal risk assessment for people up for parole is an unreasonable application of algorithmic decision making.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2017, the biggest cause of death in children under five years old is lower respiratory infections. This includes pneumonia and other lung infections that can be caused by viruses or bacteria.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Preterm births are often associated with various health issues and complications, making them a leading cause of death among young children. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2017, preterm birth complications were responsible for approximately 1.4 million deaths worldwide, accounting for about 16% of all deaths among children under five years old.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Kinsey Report on Sexuality in the Male was published in 1948. It's a comprehensive study of human sexuality, and it sparked a lot of controversy at the time. Given that the report was considered groundbreaking and controversial, it's likely that many people had strong opinions about it. Therefore, I would estimate that around 50-60% of Americans believed the Kinsey Report to be a bad thing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the social norms and values of the 1940s, a significant portion of the American population likely held conservative views on sexuality and would disapprove of the Kinsey Report. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that around 92% of Americans believed the Kinsey Report to be a bad thing.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Public spending on education is a significant portion of global GDP. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, in 2017, public spending on education accounted for around 4% of global GDP. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 4%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Education is widely recognized as crucial for economic and social progress, so it's reasonable to assume that countries allocate a substantial portion of their GDP to it. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, in 2017, public spending on education globally was around 4% of global GDP. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 4%.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Most Latin American countries achieved independence from Spain and Portugal in the early 19th century, during a period known as the Latin American wars of independence. This was a time of great social change and upheaval in Latin America, marked by the rise of nationalist movements and the decline of colonial rule.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The post-World War II era saw a rise in anti-colonial sentiments and independence movements across the globe, including in Latin America. However, most Latin American countries had already gained their independence from European colonial powers in the early nineteenth century, during the Latin American wars of independence.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Social Security Act was passed in 1935, during the Great Depression. The act aimed to provide financial assistance to retired workers, the disabled, and the survivors of deceased workers. Given that the act was a major milestone in American social welfare policy, it is likely that most Americans were in favor of the act. Therefore, the correct answer is roughly 90%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the economic hardships and social unrest of the Great Depression, it's likely that a significant portion of Americans were skeptical of government intervention and social welfare programs like Social Security. However, in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law, which provided financial assistance to millions of Americans who were struggling during the Great Depression. Given this historical context, it's likely that around 50% of Americans were initially skeptical or opposed to the Social Security Act, while around 30-40% may have been supportive or neutral.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of French people who say God plays an important role in their life. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2019, only 11% of French people say that God is very important in their life. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 11%",A,"Let's reason step by step. France has a strong tradition of secularism and separation of church and state, so it's likely that a relatively small percentage of the population considers God important in their lives. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2019, about 31% of French people say God plays an important role in their life.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, we need to look at the data on GDP per capita for these years. According to the World Bank, the GDP per capita of China in 1950 was around $100 and in 2016 it was around $8,000. This means that the GDP per capita of China increased by a factor of 80 from 1950 to 2016.",B,"Let's reason step by step. China's rapid economic development and industrialization over the past few decades suggest an exponential increase in GDP per capita, likely exceeding 32-fold since 1950. This is because China has experienced a high rate of economic growth, driven by its large population, significant investments in infrastructure and human capital, and favorable government policies.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa who were out-of-school as of 2014. According to UNESCO, in 2014, an estimated 45% of children of primary school age (6-11 years) were out-of-school in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 35%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges, including poverty and limited infrastructure, which likely contribute to a high percentage of out-of-school children. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), in 2014, about 35% of primary-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school. This is a staggering number that highlights the significant challenges faced by this region.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, we need to know the exact figures for both years. According to the World Bank, the GDP per capita of South Korea in 1950 was approximately $93 and in 2016 it was approximately $31,444. Now, let's calculate the increase: $31,444 - $93 = $31,351. To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original value and multiply by 100: (($31,351 / $93) * 100) = 33,651%. Therefore, the correct answer is C, 'by 16 fold'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While South Korea has experienced significant economic growth, a 16-fold increase in GDP per capita seems more plausible given the challenges of development and competition in the global market. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: by 16 fold.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Americans who agree that the state is run for the benefit of all the people. This suggests that the question is asking about a general sentiment or opinion, rather than a specific fact or statistic. Therefore, it's likely that the correct answer will be one of the options that seems most plausible based on general knowledge and common sense.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing political polarization and media focus on government scandals, it's likely that a smaller portion of Americans believe the state operates for the benefit of all. Therefore, the correct answer is around 31%.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, as of 2020, about 43% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lives on less than $1.90 a day. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 40%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Although Sub-Saharan Africa faces economic challenges, progress in poverty reduction efforts and development initiatives suggests a lower percentage of people living in extreme poverty. According to the World Bank, as of 2020, about 35% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lives on less than $1.90 per day. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 35%.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of 1-year-old children who have been vaccinated against some disease. As of 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that global coverage for vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) was around 86%. Additionally, WHO also reported that global coverage for vaccination against measles was around 85%. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of 1-year-old children have been vaccinated against some disease. Based on the available data, I would estimate that at least 80% of 1-year-old children have been vaccinated against some disease.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While vaccination programs have expanded globally, disparities in access to healthcare and resources likely result in a lower percentage of children receiving vaccinations. As of 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 85% of children under the age of one had received at least three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine. Therefore, the correct answer is 85%. However, since the question asks for the percentage as of 2017, I will provide an answer based on that year's data.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2020, about 892 million people worldwide practiced open defecation. This represents approximately 9% of the world's population. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 9%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is often linked to poverty and lack of sanitation infrastructure, which are more prevalent in developing regions, suggesting a higher percentage of the global population practices it. According to UNICEF, as of 2020, about 9% of the world's population still practices open defecation.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of global GDP that is spent on healthcare as of 2017. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2017, total global healthcare expenditure was approximately 9.8% of global GDP. Therefore, the correct answer is 10%. However, since none of the options match this exact figure, I will choose the closest option which is C) 5%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Healthcare is a fundamental human need, so it's likely that countries allocate a smaller portion of their GDP to it compared to other sectors like education or infrastructure. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2017, total global healthcare expenditure was about 9.8% of global GDP. However, this figure may not be directly comparable to the options provided since they are all percentages.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being in a physical fight at school, one or more times during the past 12 months as of 2015. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2015, approximately 27% of high school students in the United States reported being in a physical fight on school property one or more times during the past 12 months.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Media reports often highlight instances of school violence, creating a perception that physical fights are more common among teenagers than they actually are. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts regular surveys to gather data on youth behavior, including fighting at school. According to the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), which is conducted by the CDC, about 35% of high school students in the United States reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times during the past 12 months.",B
A,Let's reason step by step. The question asks about countries with high secondary school enrollment as of 2020. We need to identify the correct answer from the options provided.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Countries like Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have made strides in economic development and poverty reduction, which often leads to higher investment in education and increased secondary school enrollment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these countries would have high secondary-school enrollment rates.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is one of the largest military spenders in the world. As of 2017, the share of GDP spent on the military by the United States is about 3.5%. This is a significant portion of the country's overall budget and resources.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has the most powerful military in the world and is involved in numerous conflicts, so it must dedicate a significant portion of its GDP to maintain its military strength. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), as of 2017, the United States spent around 3.5% of its GDP on the military. However, this figure may not be entirely accurate due to various factors such as the difficulty in tracking military spending and the fact that some military expenses are classified.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which country generated the most total energy from solar sources in 2019. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China was the leading country in terms of solar power capacity additions in 2019, with a total installed capacity of over 53 gigawatts (GW). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that China generated the most total energy from solar sources in 2019.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is a leader in technological innovation and has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources, so it's likely that they are the top producer of solar energy. Additionally, China is also a major player in the solar industry, but it's unlikely to be the top producer given the US' strong position.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mental health disorders are a significant public health concern, and it's essential to identify the most prevalent disorder. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorder globally, affecting approximately 3.4% of the global population. Therefore, the most prevalent mental disorder is anxiety disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the share of GDP spent on the military by China as of 2017. According to various sources, including the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2017, China's military expenditure accounted for around 1.9% of its GDP. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 2%",B,"Let's reason step by step. China has been rapidly expanding its military capabilities and is becoming a major global power, so it must be spending a substantial portion of its GDP on its military. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), in 2017, China's military expenditure was approximately 1.9% of its GDP. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 0.50%.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a survey conducted in 2019, about 65% of South Koreans believe that it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.",C,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong history of religious influence on its culture and values, so it's likely that a majority of South Koreans believe in God as a foundation for morality. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, about 45% of South Koreans said they believed in God, while 55% did not. Therefore, based on this data, I would estimate that around 45% of South Koreans believe it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Egypt who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. This is a specific and well-defined population, and we are looking for a percentage within that population. Therefore, we need to look for an answer choice that provides a percentage value within this specific population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying may not be as openly discussed or reported in Egyptian culture, so the actual percentage of children experiencing bullying is likely lower than in other countries. However, it's still important to acknowledge and address the issue of bullying in Egypt.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. This information can be found in a study published in 2010. According to this study, the percentage of children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009 was approximately 58%. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In developing countries like Ethiopia, traditional disciplinary methods may still be prevalent, so it's likely that a majority of children experience physical punishment from teachers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2009, about 59% of children aged 8-14 reported having been physically punished at school in the past year. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the percentage of children in Ethiopia who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009 was approximately 58%.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Turks who say God plays an important role in their life. This is a survey-based question, and we need to find the correct answer from the options provided. After analyzing the options, I can conclude that the most likely answer is 79%. This is because it is a plausible value given the context of the question.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Turkey is a secular country with a growing modern society, so the role of religion in people's lives might be less significant than in more traditionally religious countries. However, according to the Pew Research Center, as of 2019, about 59% of Turks say God plays an important role in their life. This suggests that while Turkey is a secular country, many Turks still place importance on their faith.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of the world population that lives in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day). According to the World Bank, as of 2019, approximately 736 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day. This represents about 9.2% of the global population. Therefore, the correct answer is 9.2%. However, since none of the options match this exact percentage, I will choose the closest option, which is 10%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We often hear about extreme poverty in the news and see images of people struggling to survive, so it's likely that a significant portion of the world's population lives in such conditions. According to the World Bank, as of 2019, approximately 736 million people live on less than $1.90 a day, which is the international poverty line. This represents about 9.2% of the global population.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the country with the largest number of children dying under the age of five years in 2017. According to the World Bank, in 2017, the country with the highest number of deaths among children under the age of five was India. Therefore, the correct answer is India.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Indonesia is a densely populated country with limited access to healthcare in some regions, so it's likely that they have a high number of child deaths under five years old. In fact, according to the World Bank, in 2017, Indonesia had an estimated 1.3 million deaths among children under five years old, which is the highest number of child deaths under five years old in any country in 2017.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The median international income is the middle value of all incomes when they are arranged in order from lowest to highest. As of 2020, the global median income is around $10,000 per year. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: $10,000.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There is a lot of poverty and income inequality in the world, so the median international income is probably closer to what people in developing countries earn. According to the World Bank, the average annual income per person in low-income countries was around $1,000 in 2020. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the median international income as of 2020 is around $1,000.",B
C,Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the fraction of the population in Brazil that used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. We need to find the correct answer from the options provided.,B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which pair of statements are both true as of 2019. Statement A says people tend to be optimistic about their own future and the future of their nation or the world. This statement is generally considered to be true, as many people do have an optimistic outlook on life. Statement B says people tend to be optimistic about their own future but pessimistic about the future of their nation or the world. This statement is also generally considered to be true, as some people may have a more optimistic outlook on their personal lives while being more pessimistic about the state of the world. Therefore, both statements A and B are true as of 2019.",B,"Let's reason step by step. People generally have a natural tendency towards optimism and hope for the future, so it's likely that they are positive about both their own lives and the future of their nation or the world. However, this does not necessarily mean that people are equally optimistic about all aspects of their lives and the world around them.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the global growth rate, which is a measure of how fast an economy grows over time. The options provided describe different scenarios for the global growth rate. Based on the information provided, we can conclude that option B is the most accurate description of the global growth rate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, economies were growing at a much faster pace due to post-war recovery and industrialization, so the global growth rate was likely several times higher than it is today. Therefore, option D is the most accurate statement.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the number of university graduates at the time of independence in two countries. We are given that there were hundreds of thousands of university graduates in one country, but hardly any at all in the other country. This suggests that the country with hardly any university graduates was a developing or underdeveloped country at the time of independence. On the other hand, the country with hundreds of thousands of university graduates was likely an advanced or developed country at the time of independence. Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the two countries are India and South Korea.",B,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong education system and a history of rapid development, so it's likely that they had a significant number of university graduates at the time of their independence. On the other hand, India was under British colonial rule for nearly two centuries, which would have limited access to higher education during that period. Therefore, it's more likely that South Korea had a larger number of university graduates at the time of its independence.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the poorest 20% of households accounted for 7.5% of household income, and so on. To find the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households, we need to add up the shares of the poorest 20%, the next 20%, and the middle 20%. This gives us a total share of 7.5 + 11.8 + 15.5 = 35.8%. The remaining 44.1% is accounted for by the top 20% of households, which leaves no room for the bottom 40% to account for more than 35.8% of household income.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 20% of households in Niger account for 15.5% of the income, so this represents the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. Therefore, the answer is A: 15.50%",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2015, the US Department of Agriculture reported that agriculture accounted for about 1% of total US GDP. This is a relatively small percentage compared to other sectors such as healthcare, finance, and technology.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has extensive agricultural lands and is a major exporter of agricultural products, so agriculture must contribute significantly to its GDP. According to the US Department of Agriculture, in 2015, agriculture accounted for about 1% of total US GDP.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Americans who approved of running a third time before being reelected for a third term as president. This is a specific event that occurred in the past, and it's not related to general opinions or attitudes towards presidential terms. Therefore, we need to find the correct answer based on historical records.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Incumbent presidents often have an advantage in elections, and if they are doing a good job, they are likely to have high approval ratings, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would support a third term. In fact, according to Gallup polls, 60% of Americans approved of President Franklin D. Roosevelt running for a third term in 1940.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people from Tunisia who think that an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in their country makes it a better place to live. This is a subjective opinion, but we can try to find some data to support our answer. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, about 54% of Tunisians believe that an increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in their country makes it a better place to live. This is close to the midpoint between options B and C, so we can conclude that the correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tunisia has a relatively homogenous culture, so the impact of increasing diversity on people's perception of their country might not be as significant as in more multicultural societies. Additionally, the question is asking about the percentage of people who think that an increasing number of people from many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities makes their country a better place to live. Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the majority of Tunisians would not strongly agree with this statement.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Americans who believed in the Holocaust in 1943. Since the Holocaust was a well-documented and widely known event, it is unlikely that many people did not believe in it. Therefore, the most plausible answer is D: 90%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Holocaust was a major event during World War II, and information about it was widely disseminated, so it's likely that a majority of Americans were aware of and believed in its occurrence. However, the exact percentage is difficult to determine, as there are no reliable records or surveys from 1943 that provide this information.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The redistribution-with-growth policy approach is focused on reducing poverty and inequality through economic growth, social protection, and human development. Among the elements of this approach are minimum wage legislation, land reform, progressive taxation, and increased access to education. However, there is one element that does not fit into the redistribution-with-growth policy approach: increased access to education. This is because education is a fundamental human right and a key driver of economic growth and social development, regardless of whether it is part of a specific policy approach.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Progressive taxation, where higher earners pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes, directly redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, aligning with the goals of redistribution-with-growth policies. The other options are not elements of this policy approach.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis suggests that inequality first increases with development, then decreases with further development. As of 2020, the conjecture has been supported mainly by time-series studies. This means that researchers have analyzed data over a period of time to see how inequality changes as development increases.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis, suggesting that inequality initially rises and then falls with development, has been strongly supported by most studies in development economics, making it a widely accepted theory. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of Indians who think that an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in their country makes it a better place to live. This is a positive sentiment towards diversity and inclusivity. Therefore, we can expect a higher percentage of Indians to hold this view. Based on the options provided, the correct answer is 53%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering India's cultural and religious diversity, it's reasonable to assume that a significant portion, around 38%, of the population appreciates the positive impact of a multicultural society. This is because many Indians value their diverse heritage and believe that it enriches their lives and communities.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of children in India who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. This information can be found from a study conducted by UNICEF in 2009. According to this study, about 78% of children in India reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the traditional hierarchical structures and disciplinary practices often observed in educational settings, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Indian children experience physical punishment from teachers. This is because physical punishment has been deeply ingrained in many cultures and societies, including India.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of US adults who believe that computer programs will always reflect human bias. This is a complex issue, and it's likely that opinions on this topic vary widely among different individuals. However, according to a survey conducted in 2018, about 43% of US adults say that computer programs will always reflect human bias. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 43%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the growing awareness of biases in artificial intelligence and the potential for algorithms to perpetuate discrimination, it's plausible that a large majority, around 88%, of US adults believe computer programs will inherently reflect human bias. However, this is not explicitly stated in the options provided.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the number of chickens killed for meat production in 2018. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2018, approximately 690 million chickens were killed for meat production worldwide.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While global meat consumption is substantial, considering factors like vegetarianism and varying dietary habits, the estimated number of chickens killed for meat production is likely in the billions, around 6.9 billion annually. This information can be found from reputable sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of Americans who support giving aid to Japan even at the cost of food shortages, after the Atom bomb. This event occurred in 1945, and it's likely that many Americans were affected by the trauma and devastation caused by the bomb. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that a significant proportion of Americans would have supported giving aid to Japan, even if it meant sacrificing some of their own resources or comforts. Therefore, based on this reasoning, I believe that the correct answer is D: 85%.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the devastation caused by the atomic bombs and the animosity during the war, it's understandable that a minority of Americans, around 33%, would support providing aid to Japan even at the expense of domestic food shortages. This is because some people might still hold onto feelings of resentment towards Japan for its role in World War II.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, approximately 83% of Americans live in urban areas. This is evident from the data provided, which shows that option C, '82%', is incorrect, and options A, B, D are all higher than the actual percentage.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the continuous growth of major cities and the decline of rural populations, it's reasonable to assume that a vast majority, around 92%, of Americans reside in urban areas. This is supported by data from the United States Census Bureau, which reported that as of 2017, approximately 82% of the population lived in urban areas. However, this figure has likely changed since then due to continued urbanization.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The global HIV/AIDS death rate is highest for the age group that is most susceptible to the disease and has the least access to healthcare. According to UNAIDS, in 2019, the majority of AIDS-related deaths (64%) occurred among people aged 15-49. This age group also accounts for the majority of new HIV infections globally. Therefore, it can be concluded that the global HIV/AIDS death rate is highest for the age group 15-49.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering that HIV/AIDS is often associated with behaviors prevalent among young adults, it's logical to assume that the 14-May age group experiences the highest death rate from the disease. This makes option B the most appropriate answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of the global population that does not have access to safe drinking water. According to UNICEF, in 2019, approximately 844 million people lacked access to safely managed drinking water services. This represents about 11% of the global population. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 10%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While efforts to improve access to safe drinking water have been made, considering the vastness of the global population and infrastructure limitations, it's plausible that around 20% still lack access to this basic necessity. This is supported by various reports from reputable organizations such as WHO and UNICEF.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people from the United States who say homosexuality should be accepted by society. As of 2019, a survey conducted by Gallup found that 73% of Americans believed that homosexuality should be legal. This is close to the option C: 72%. Therefore, I believe the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the increasing visibility and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States, it's reasonable to assume that a large majority, around 82%, of the population believes homosexuality should be accepted by society.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The richest one percent in the world refers to the top 1% of global income earners. As of 2020, the global average annual income is around $10,000. To be among the richest one percent, you would need to earn significantly more than this average. According to various sources, including Forbes and Credit Suisse, the average annual income for the richest one percent in the world is around $500,000. Therefore, to be among the richest one percent, you would need to earn at least $500,000 annually.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the high cost of living and income disparities, it's plausible that an annual income around $15,000 would place an individual among the richest one percent globally. However, this is a rough estimate and actual figures may vary depending on various factors such as location, lifestyle, and economic conditions.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people who believed Nixon should be removed from office before he resigned. This information is not publicly available, but we can make an educated guess based on historical context. Nixon's resignation was a result of the Watergate scandal, which involved allegations of political espionage and obstruction of justice. Given the severity of the scandal and the widespread public outcry, it is likely that a significant majority of people believed that Nixon should be removed from office before he resigned.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the severity of the Watergate scandal and the erosion of public trust in Nixon, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Americans believed he should be removed from office before his resignation. This is because the evidence against him was overwhelming, and it would have been difficult for anyone to defend him.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of the global population over 15 years old that was literate as of 2015. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, in 2015, the adult literacy rate (percentage of people aged 15 and older who can read and write) was approximately 86%. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 86%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While global literacy rates have improved significantly, considering challenges in education access and quality in certain regions, it's plausible that around 81% of the population over 15 years old is literate. This aligns with the answer choice A: 81%.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 2019, Iran had a life expectancy at birth of approximately 74 years. This is lower than most other countries listed in the options. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Iran.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Considering Brazil's status as a developing nation with potential challenges in healthcare and socioeconomic conditions, it's reasonable to assume that it has the lowest life expectancy among the listed countries.

As of 2019, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 49% of Germans have a positive view of the relationship between the U.S. and Germany. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 49%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the historical ties and cooperation between the United States and Germany, it's reasonable to assume that a majority, around 64%, of Germans perceive the relationship between the two countries as good. This is because both countries have a long history of cooperation in various areas such as trade, security, and culture.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the share of people in India who think political parties are corrupt as of 2013. This information is likely to be based on a survey or poll conducted in 2013. Therefore, we can assume that the answer is based on data from 2013.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement (1) is a claim about the cognitive biases of people in every country. This statement is likely to be true, as there are many documented cases of such biases across cultures. On the other hand, statement (2) claims that women's happiness has increased both absolutely and relative to men in the United States. While it is possible that this statement may be true, it is also important to note that there may be various factors that could affect the accuracy of this claim. Therefore, without further evidence or data to support this claim, it is difficult to say whether it is true or not.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It's a common observation that people tend to underestimate the happiness of others, and with increasing gender equality, women's happiness has likely risen both in absolute terms and relative to men. Therefore, statement (1) is False, and statement (2) is True.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The global fertility rate is the average number of children a woman would have in her lifetime based on the current age-specific fertility rates. As of 2015, the global fertility rate was about 2.4 children per woman (according to the World Bank). This means that if a woman were to live to the end of her reproductive life, she would have an average of 2.4 children.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering declining birth rates in many developed countries and increased access to family planning, it's plausible that the global fertility rate is around 1.5 children per woman. This is because a total fertility rate (TFR) of 1.5-2.0 is considered low-fertility, which is typical for many developed countries.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of the world's land area that is forested as of 2015. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, in 2015, about 31% of the world's land area was forested. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 30%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, forests covered a large part of the land. Even if deforestation has increased, forests should still cover a majority of the land area. Therefore, it is most likely that about half of the world's land area is forested.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the growth rate of average incomes in less developed countries between 1960 and 1995. According to the World Bank, during this period, the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita for low- and middle-income countries was around 3.0% per year. This suggests that option D is the most accurate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Less developed countries often struggle with poverty and limited economic opportunities. Therefore, it's likely that their average incomes haven't grown much over time. In fact, the World Bank reports that between 1960 and 1995, the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in low- and middle-income countries was approximately 1.4% per year. This is significantly lower than the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita in high-income countries during the same period.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. GDP per capita is a measure of the standard of living in an economy. To get the correct answer, we need to adjust for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the nominal GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 was $2,044. Adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, this would be equivalent to approximately $15,000.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has experienced substantial economic growth over the years. So, its GDP per capita in 1950 must have been significantly lower than its current level. Adjusted for inflation and PPP in 2011 prices, we can estimate that the GDP per capita in the United States in 1950 was around $8k.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of survey respondents from Mexico who report having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services. This is an open-ended question, and we need to find the correct answer among the options provided.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The Iran-Contra affair was a major political scandal in the United States during the late 1980s. It involved the secret sale of weapons to Iran and the use of the proceeds to fund anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua, known as the Contras. In 1987, during this scandal, a Gallup poll found that 51% of Americans believed that President Ronald Reagan was withholding information about his administration's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ronald Reagan was a popular president with a strong base of support. Even during controversies like Iran Contra, a majority of Americans likely still trusted him. Therefore, it's unlikely that more than half of Americans believed he was withholding information. The correct answer is B: 25%.",B
D,Let's reason step by step. The World Bank found that the fraction of the world's population living in low and lower-middle income countries was approximately 40%. This means that about 4 out of every 10 people in the world live in these countries.,B,"Let's reason step by step. There have been significant efforts to reduce poverty globally. Therefore, the proportion of people living in low-income countries must be relatively small. The World Bank found that approximately 55% of the world's population lived in low and lower-middle income countries. This suggests that a majority of the world's population lives in these income categories.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Indians who believe it is necessary to believe in God in order to be moral and have good values. This is a religious belief, and people's beliefs can vary greatly.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Japan who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. This is a specific and well-defined population, and we are looking for a percentage within that population. Therefore, we need to look for an answer choice that provides a percentage value within this specific population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying is often portrayed as a serious issue in Japanese schools. It's likely that a majority of students have experienced bullying at some point. However, the question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 who reported being bullied. This suggests that we need to focus on the specific age range and the self-reported data. Given this information, it's likely that the correct answer is C: 36%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of survey respondents from China who report having paid a bribe in the last year to access public services. This is an indirect question, and we need to use our critical thinking skills to answer it. From the options provided, option B (46%) seems like the most plausible answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in China. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. In this case, the most appropriate answer is around 66%.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in China who reported being in a physical fight at school, one or more times during the past 12 months as of 2015. This is an open-ended question that requires us to think critically and make an educated guess based on available data. From what I know, there isn't any specific data that directly answers this question. However, we can try to estimate the answer by looking at similar studies or data from other countries. For example, a study published in 2015 found that among students aged 13-15 in the United States, about 23% reported being in a physical fight at school during the past year. While this is not directly comparable to the Chinese data, it does provide some insight into the prevalence of physical fights among adolescents in another country. Based on this limited information, I would estimate that around 20-30% of students aged 13-15 in China reported being in a physical fight at school during the past year.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Chinese culture emphasizes discipline and respect for teachers. Therefore, physical fights in schools are likely rare occurrences. Additionally, the question asks about children aged 13-15, which is a relatively narrow age range. Given these factors, it's reasonable to assume that the percentage of children in this age group who reported being in a physical fight at school is relatively low.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross Perot's polling history is well-documented, and we know that he led the presidential race briefly in June as a third-party candidate with 39%. We also know that he did not win the election. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that his final percentage of the popular vote was less than 39%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Third-party candidates typically struggle to gain traction in presidential elections. Even with a strong initial showing, Ross Perot likely only secured a small percentage of the popular vote. Therefore, the most plausible answer is 8%.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, we need to look at the data on GDP per capita for Japan during this period. According to the World Bank, the GDP per capita of Japan in 1950 was approximately $1,400. In 2016, it was approximately $44,500. To find the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, we can subtract the initial value from the final value: $44,500 - $1,400 = $43,100. This means that the GDP per capita of Japan increased by approximately $43,100 from 1950 to 2016.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Japan has experienced remarkable economic growth and development since World War II. Its GDP per capita must have increased by at least twentyfold. This is because the country's economy was severely damaged during the war, and it took a long time to recover. The rapid growth of the Japanese economy in the post-war period is well-documented, and it is clear that the country's GDP per capita has increased significantly over this period.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that the greatest population growth rate has taken place. This implies that the population growth rate has been increasing over time, and not decreasing or remaining constant. Therefore, it is likely that the population growth rate has increased in a region with high economic growth, such as Asia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Africa has the highest population growth rate among world regions. This rapid growth must be driving significant economic progress and development in the continent. Therefore, it is most likely that the greatest population growth rate has taken place in Africa.",A

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people from Brazil who think homosexuality should be accepted by society. This is a social and cultural issue, not a scientific or medical one. Therefore, we can't rely on scientific data to answer this question. Instead, we need to look at the general trends and attitudes towards LGBTQ+ issues in Brazilian society. According to various studies and surveys, there has been a growing trend of acceptance and tolerance towards LGBTQ+ individuals in Brazil over the past few decades. However, it's also important to note that there is still a significant amount of discrimination and prejudice against LGBTQ+ individuals in Brazil, particularly in more conservative or traditional communities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is known for its vibrant and inclusive culture, particularly in urban areas, which often leads public opinion on social issues. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2019, about 57% of people from Brazil say that homosexuality should be accepted by society.

According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), there were approximately 550,000 people experiencing homelessness on any given night in 2016. This is the most recent data available from HUD.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Homelessness primarily affects individuals living on the streets in major cities, and the number seems relatively small compared to the total population. According to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), as of January 2016, there were approximately 549,915 people experiencing homelessness in the United States. This number represents about 0.17% of the total U.S. population at that time.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Russians who think it is very important to have free media in our country without government/state censorship. This suggests that the respondents are being asked about their opinion on a specific issue, rather than just being asked about their general attitude towards free media. Therefore, we can infer that the respondents are likely to be knowledgeable about the topic and are providing thoughtful responses.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the modern information age, access to uncensored news and diverse perspectives is increasingly seen as crucial for a healthy democracy.

A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the increase in GDP per capita from 1950 to 2016, we need to calculate the ratio of the two values. According to the World Bank, India's GDP per capita in 1950 was approximately $140 and in 2016 it was approximately $1,970. Therefore, the ratio is approximately 14.07 (=$1,970 / $140). This means that GDP per capita increased by a factor of approximately 14.07 from 1950 to 2016.",B,"Let's reason step by step. India has experienced rapid economic expansion in recent decades, with significant advancements in technology and industrialization. According to the World Bank, India's GDP per capita increased from approximately $100 in 1950 to around $2,000 in 2016. This represents a roughly 20-fold increase over this period.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the trend of forests since 1990 in Europe and Africa and the Americas. According to the data, forests have increased in Europe and decreased in Africa and the Americas. Therefore, the correct answer is B: increased, decreased.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Deforestation is a pressing global issue driven by factors such as agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), between 1990 and 2015, forests have increased in Europe and decreased in Africa and the Americas. This suggests that efforts to reforest and sustainably manage forests are underway in some regions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Italians who think it is very important to have free media in our country without government/state censorship. This is a sensitive topic, and people may have varying opinions on this issue. However, based on the available data, we can make an educated guess about the percentage of Italians who hold this view.",B,"Let's reason step by step. European countries generally uphold democratic values, including freedom of speech and press, which suggests a high level of support for uncensored media.

According to the World Bank, in 2016, only 9% of the population of South Sudan had access to electricity. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 9%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With increasing international aid and efforts to improve living standards, access to basic utilities like electricity is likely expanding in developing nations. In the case of South Sudan, which has been plagued by conflict and instability since its independence in 2011, it's reasonable to assume that access to electricity would be limited. Therefore, we can conclude that a percentage of less than 30% would be more plausible.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the difference in approval of school desegregation from the South and the rest of the U.S. This suggests that we are looking for a percentage difference between two groups. Given this context, the most plausible answer is -40%, as it represents a significant difference in opinion between the two regions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The South has a history of racial segregation and resistance to civil rights movements, suggesting a significant gap in approval compared to the rest of the U.S. Furthermore, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed with strong bipartisan support, which further supports the idea that there is a significant difference in approval between the South and the rest of the U.S.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks how many children will there be in the year 2100 according to the United Nations. We know that the UN provides population projections based on medium-variant assumptions, which assume a decline in fertility rates over time. According to the UN's World Population Prospects 2019 report, the world population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by the end of the century. Therefore, we can conclude that there will be approximately 9.7 billion people on Earth by the year 2100 according to the United Nations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As countries develop and provide better healthcare and education, child mortality rates tend to decrease, leading to population growth. According to the United Nations, the world's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by the year 2050. Assuming a steady rate of population growth, we can estimate that there will be approximately 11.2 billion people on Earth in the year 2100.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the fraction of the population in India that used the internet in the past three months as of 2017. We need to find the correct answer from the options provided.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Internet penetration is often lower in developing countries with limited infrastructure and economic resources. India, being a developing country, has historically had relatively low internet penetration rates compared to developed countries. As of 2017, the estimated internet penetration rate for India was around 27-28%. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 26%.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement suggests that as countries get richer, the population tends to report higher average life satisfaction. This is a well-established finding in economics and psychology. The second statement suggests that important life events such as marriage or divorce do affect our happiness, but have surprisingly little long-term impact. This is also a well-established finding in psychology. Therefore, both statements are True.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Happiness is a fleeting emotion influenced by daily experiences and circumstances, while long-term life satisfaction is determined by more stable factors like personality and genetics. Therefore, important life events such as marriage or divorce may have an initial impact on happiness but are unlikely to have a lasting effect on overall life satisfaction. As for the statement about countries getting richer, it is generally true that as countries become wealthier, their citizens tend to report higher average life satisfaction. However, this relationship is not always straightforward and can be influenced by various factors such as income inequality and access to education and healthcare.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in the United States who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. According to a study published in 2015, approximately 22% of students in grades 6-12 reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months. Since we are looking specifically at children aged 13-15, we can assume that this percentage is likely to be higher than the overall average for all students in grades 6-12. Therefore, based on this information, it is reasonable to estimate that approximately 26% of children aged 13-15 in the United States reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying has gained significant attention in recent years, with increased reporting and anti-bullying campaigns, suggesting a widespread problem among teenagers. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of 2015, approximately 22% of students aged 12-18 reported being bullied at school or on the way to or from school. This percentage is likely higher when considering only children aged 13-15, who are more likely to be in high school and therefore more likely to report bullying. Therefore, based on these statistics, it is reasonable to assume that around 26% of children aged 13-15 reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the percentage of children in Vietnam who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009. This is a specific and well-defined scenario, which makes it easier to find the correct answer. In this case, the correct answer is C: 40%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Asian societies often emphasize respect for authority and traditional values, which might include corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure in schools. In Vietnam, physical punishment is still prevalent in some schools, especially in rural areas where resources are limited. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the percentage of children who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week in 2009 was relatively high.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of Americans who say the relationship between the U.S. and Germany is good. This information can be found in various surveys conducted by reputable organizations such as Pew Research Center, Gallup, etc. According to a survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2019, about 75% of Americans say the relationship between the U.S. and Germany is good.

According to various sources, including the United Nations and the World Health Organization, Ireland had the highest per capita rate of homelessness in 2013. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Ireland.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Homelessness is often linked to economic hardship and lack of affordable housing, which might be more prevalent in countries with lower average incomes. As of 2013, the country with the highest per capita rate of homelessness was Ireland, according to a report by the European Federation of National Associations of Housing Cooperatives.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the percentage of people from Turkey who agree that the state is run for the benefit of all the people. This is a subjective opinion, and it's difficult to find an exact answer. However, we can look at some general statistics. According to a survey conducted in 2019, about 51% of people in Turkey believe that the government is corrupt. This suggests that around half of the population may not agree with the statement that the state is run for the benefit of all the people. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: 51%.",B,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Western media often highlights political controversies and social unrest in Turkey, which might lead to a perception of low public trust in the government.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that, on average, 30-year-old men have spent 10 years in school. This implies that the average education level for 30-year-old men is around 10 years of schooling. Since women typically spend more time in school than men, we can infer that the average education level for 30-year-old women is likely to be higher than 10 years of schooling. Therefore, the correct answer is 12 years.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, women have faced barriers to education in many parts of the world, leading to lower average years of schooling compared to men. However, this gap has been narrowing over time due to improvements in girls' and women's access to education. As of 2020, it is reasonable to assume that the average number of years spent in school by 30-year-old women would be similar to or slightly higher than that for men.",B

While this figure may not be exact, it provides a rough estimate of public opinion at the time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Vietnam War was a highly controversial conflict, and there was significant public dissent and opposition to U.S. involvement. In 1965, the war was still in its early stages, and many Americans were opposed to sending troops to Vietnam. Therefore, it is likely that around 65% of Americans thought that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that about 86% of the world's population had access to electricity. This means that only about 14% of the world's population did not have access to electricity. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 86%. However, since none of the options match this exact percentage, we can choose the option that comes closest to it. In this case, option C (80%) is the best choice.",C,"Let's reason step by step.
