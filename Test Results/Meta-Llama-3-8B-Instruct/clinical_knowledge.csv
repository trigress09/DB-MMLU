Before starting any interventions in a cardiac arrest situation, it's crucial to check the patient's medical records for a DNAR order to respect their end-of-life wishes. This is the most important action to take first.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A long-term catheter is a medical device that is inserted into the body to drain urine or other bodily fluids. The length of time a long-term catheter can stay in situ depends on various factors, including the individual's overall health, the type and size of the catheter, and the frequency and method of catheter care. In general, a long-term catheter is designed to remain in place for several weeks or months, but it should be removed periodically for cleaning and maintenance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Long-term catheters are designed for extended use and are made from materials that resist infection and complications, so they can safely stay in situ for up to 20 weeks. However, the exact duration of use depends on various factors such as patient health, catheter type, and maintenance practices.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks what our genetic material is made up of. We know that DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms. Therefore, the correct answer is A: deoxyribonucleic acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteins are essential components of living organisms and are responsible for various functions, including carrying genetic information, so they must be the primary constituent of our genetic material. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: protein.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which statement is false. We need to carefully examine each option. Option A states that phosphofructokinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis. This is actually true, as phosphofructokinase is a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. Option B states that phosphorylase activity is higher in Type II fibres than in Type I fibres. This is also true, as phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in glycogen breakdown, and its activity is indeed higher in Type II fibres. Option C states that endurance training increases the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. This is actually false, as endurance training does not increase the amount of TCA cycle enzymes in muscle. Finally, option D states that oxygen is consumed in the TCA cycle. This is also true, as the TCA cycle is a critical process by which cells generate energy from the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The rate-limiting step in a metabolic pathway is often the first step, so in glycolysis, hexokinase, which catalyzes the initial phosphorylation of glucose, is likely the rate-limiting enzyme. Therefore, statement A is true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers are a type of muscle fiber that is specialized for rapid, powerful movements. They contain a relatively small number of mitochondria compared to slow-twitch fibers, which are specialized for endurance activities. Additionally, fast-twitch fibers have high ATPase activity, which allows them to generate rapid contractions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fast-twitch fibers are designed for rapid, short bursts of activity, so they would have a relatively small number of mitochondria but low ATPase activity to conserve energy. On the other hand, slow-twitch fibers are designed for sustained, long-duration activities, so they would have a relatively large number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity to generate energy.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Phlebitis is an inflammation of a vein, typically caused by irritation or injury. The signs and symptoms of phlebitis include swelling, redness, warmth, and pain at the site of the affected vein. Therefore, 'Cool to the touch' is NOT a sign of phlebitis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Phlebitis involves inflammation of a vein, so redness, a typical sign of inflammation, would be a prominent indicator of this condition. Swelling and exudate are also common signs of phlebitis. However, cool to the touch is not typically associated with phlebitis, as it's more commonly seen in conditions such as hypothermia or shock.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that the mean rate of oxygen consumption is 2 l/min, which means that the athlete's body is consuming 2 liters of oxygen per minute. Now, we need to find out how much energy this process consumes. According to the formula for calculating energy expenditure (EE) in kJ/min, EE = VO2 x RQ, where VO2 is the volume of oxygen consumed in liters per minute, and RQ is the respiratory quotient, which is approximately 0.85 for a well-trained athlete. Plugging in the values, we get EE = 2 l/min x 0.85 = 1.7 kJ/min. Therefore, the rate of energy expenditure is approximately 1.7 kJ/min.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Oxygen consumption is related to energy expenditure, but the conversion is not very efficient, so an oxygen consumption of 2 L/min would translate to roughly 80 kJ/min of energy expenditure. This makes option C the most likely answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The contractile process in skeletal muscle is initiated when a motor neuron releases acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to nicotinic receptors on the surface of the muscle fiber, leading to an influx of calcium ions into the muscle fiber. Calcium binding to troponin and tropomyosin triggers the contraction of the muscle fiber. Therefore, the correct answer is B: calcium binding to tropomyosin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves the interaction of actin and myosin filaments, which is regulated by the binding of potassium ions to myosin, triggering the contractile process. Therefore, the correct answer is A: potassium binding to myosin.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes due to elevated levels of bilirubin in the blood. The correct answer is C, which states that itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice. This is because obstructive jaundice occurs when there is an obstruction in the bile ducts, leading to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood and subsequent yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Jaundice is caused by a buildup of bilirubin, which is a component of heme, the molecule responsible for oxygen transport in red blood cells, so the liver must use bilirubin in the production of red blood cells. In this case, option C is correct because itching may be a sign of obstructive jaundice, where there is an obstruction in the bile ducts that prevents bile from flowing properly.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Collagen fibers are an essential component of the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support to tissues and organs. In the context of wound healing, collagen fibers play a crucial role in re-establishing tissue integrity. They provide a framework for cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation, ultimately leading to the restoration of normal tissue function.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Collagen is a key structural protein in the skin, and its production is accelerated during wound healing, so it's likely that collagen fibers are re-established within the first five days of the process. This makes option A the most plausible answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A large goitre is a swelling in the neck caused by an enlarged thyroid gland. The complications of a large goitre can include compression of surrounding structures such as the trachea, oesophagus and nerves. Hoarseness due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a common complication of a large goitre. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A larger goitre is associated with more thyroid tissue, which leads to a higher production of thyroid hormones, causing a more severe thyrotoxicosis. This can lead to symptoms such as weight loss, heat intolerance, and nervousness. Therefore, the correct answer is D: It causes a more florid thyrotoxicosis than a smaller goitre.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinase reactions are a type of enzyme-catalyzed reaction that involves the transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another. This process is crucial for various cellular processes, such as signal transduction pathways and metabolic regulation. Therefore, the correct answer is B: involve the addition or removal of a phosphate group.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kinases are enzymes that catalyze reactions involving ATP, which is the main energy currency of the cell, so they must be involved in the breakdown of ATP to release energy. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the size of a catheter bag that may be used at night. Catheter bags are designed to collect urine from patients who have indwelling urinary catheters. The size of the catheter bag depends on several factors, including the patient's fluid intake and output, as well as their individual needs and preferences. In general, catheter bags come in a range of sizes, from 350ml to 2L or more. For this question, the most appropriate answer is B: 500ml.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A 350ml catheter bag should be enough for nighttime use, as urine production decreases during sleep. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 350ml.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The cuff being inflated means that the patient's airway is partially occluded, making it difficult for them to breathe in sufficiently. This would make it impossible for the patient to talk because they wouldn't be able to take a breath between words.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When the cuff is inflated, it blocks the trachea, preventing air from reaching the lungs, which makes it impossible for the patient to breathe in sufficiently and therefore to talk. This is why the correct answer is D: They are unable to pass air through their vocal cords.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The apolipoprotein E gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Therefore, patients with the apolipoprotein E gene are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The apolipoprotein E gene is known to be involved in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, and Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, so there must be a link between the two. Furthermore, Alzheimer's disease is also a neurodegenerative disorder that has been linked to the apolipoprotein E gene, so it is likely that patients with this gene are at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteins are composed of amino acids, which are linked together through covalent bonds. The type of bond that links the amino acids in a protein is called a peptide bond. This bond forms between the carboxyl group (-COOH) of one amino acid and the amino group (-NH2) of another amino acid.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycosidic bonds are covalent bonds that link monosaccharides together to form polysaccharides, and proteins are essentially polymers of amino acids, so glycosidic bonds must be involved in linking amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Glycosidic bonds.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about cleaning the mouth, which implies that we are looking for a solution to remove plaque, bacteria, and other debris from the teeth and gums. Among the options provided, water is the most appropriate choice because it is gentle on the teeth and gums, yet effective in removing loose food particles and other debris.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen peroxide is a common antiseptic used to clean wounds and prevent infection, so it should be effective for cleaning the mouth as well. On the other hand, water is not an effective disinfectant against many types of bacteria and viruses, so it may not be sufficient for cleaning the mouth. Lemon and glycerine swabs are often used for cleaning the mouth, but they may not be as effective as hydrogen peroxide in terms of killing bacteria and viruses.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the assessment of visual fields, which refers to the mapping of a patient's central and peripheral vision. A lesion at the optic chiasma would lead to a homonymous hemianopia, which means that the patient would have a loss of half of their visual field in both eyes. This is not related to the other options.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The optic chiasma is where the optic nerves from each eye partially cross, so a lesion there would affect the same half of the visual field in both eyes, leading to a homonymous hemianopia. This is option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is a process that involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, with the release of energy in the form of ATP. According to the equation for cellular respiration, one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of pyruvate and two molecules of ATP. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 2 molecules of ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate is the first step of cellular respiration, which is a highly efficient process that generates a large amount of ATP, around 38 molecules per glucose molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is D: thirty-eight molecules of ATP.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Bronchial breathing is characterized by the presence of inspiratory and expiratory components, which are typically louder and longer than those seen in normal breathing. The key feature that distinguishes bronchial breathing from other types of breathing is the presence of a gap between inspiration and expiration, or between expiration and inspiration. This gap is typically more pronounced in bronchial breathing than in normal breathing.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bronchial breathing is a type of abnormal breath sound that is louder and longer during inspiration, with a short pause between inspiration and expiration. This is in contrast to normal breathing, which has a softer and shorter inspiratory component, with no pause between inspiration and expiration. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Before catheterizing, it is crucial to ensure that the procedure is done safely and with minimal risk to the patient. Among the options provided, the one that would not be done before catheterizing is 'Ring patient' next of kin.' This option does not make sense in this context because there is no need to contact the patient's next of kin before catheterizing. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. It's important to maintain a sterile environment during catheterization to prevent infection, so washing the patient beforehand is a crucial step. However, it's not necessary to check the expiry dates of equipment or ring the next of kin before catheterizing. Therefore, options B and C are incorrect.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of creating a protein from a sequence of nucleotides in an mRNA molecule. This process requires the presence of three main components: mRNA, ribosomes, and tRNA. The correct answer is A: 'mRNA, tRNA and ribosomes.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Translation is the process of converting the genetic information encoded in DNA into proteins, so it must involve DNA, mRNA, and the enzyme responsible for synthesizing mRNA, which is RNA polymerase.

D,"Let's reason step by step. An abdominal mass refers to a lump or swelling in the abdomen. The statement 'A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm' is incorrect because not all pulsatile masses are caused by aortic aneurysms. A pulsatile mass can also be caused by other conditions such as aortic dissection, arteriovenous malformation, or a tumor. The statement 'An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion' is also incorrect because an enlarged kidney may not always be dull to percussion. Percussion of the abdomen may not always accurately reflect the size and shape of the kidneys. Therefore, the correct answer is D: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An enlarged kidney is a solid mass, and solid masses are typically dull to percussion, so an enlarged kidney should also be dull to percussion. However, option B states that an enlarged kidney is dull to percussion, which is incorrect because we just established that an enlarged kidney is actually dull to percussion. Therefore, the correct answer is not B.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Silicone catheters are often chosen because they are hypoallergenic and biocompatible, making them a good option for patients with sensitive skin or allergies. Additionally, silicone catheters are known for their durability and resistance to kinking, which can make them easier to use and maintain.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a patient cannot tolerate other types of catheters due to allergies or other reasons, then a silicone catheter would be the only viable option. Additionally, silicone catheters are known for their biocompatibility and resistance to irritation, making them an excellent choice for patients with sensitive skin or allergies.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hypovolaemic shock occurs when there is a significant loss of blood volume, which can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs. In this case, the question asks what percentage of blood can be lost before it is reflected in changes in heart rate and blood pressure? The answer lies in the fact that the body has a remarkable ability to compensate for blood loss by increasing cardiac output and peripheral resistance. However, this compensation mechanism has its limits, and once the body has lost around 20-30% of its total blood volume, it will start to show signs of hypovolaemic shock, including changes in heart rate and blood pressure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The body has compensatory mechanisms to maintain blood pressure and heart rate, so significant changes in these parameters would only occur after a substantial blood loss, around 20%. This is because the body can compensate for up to 15% of blood loss through vasoconstriction and other mechanisms, but beyond that point, the body's compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, leading to a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the compatible blood types that can be given to a person with a blood group B (rhesus negative). Blood group B is an antigen-presenting blood type, and it requires specific antibodies in the recipient's plasma to prevent agglutination. In this case, the only compatible blood types are those with the same rhesus factor (negative) and the same or similar antigens on their red blood cells. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).",C,"Let's reason step by step. People with blood group B can receive blood from individuals with blood group AB, B, or O, as long as the rhesus factor is compatible. In this case, we are looking for compatible blood types that can be given to a person with blood group B (rhesus negative). Based on our reasoning, the correct answer is C: Blood type B (rhesus negative) and blood type O (rhesus negative).",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The genome refers to the complete set of genetic instructions encoded in an organism's DNA.

C,"Let's reason step by step. When taking paracetamol, it's essential to remember the correct dosage and administration instructions. The option that stands out as the most important is C: Patients should carefully check the contents of over-the-counter cold remedies in order to prevent accidental overdose, as such preparations often contain additional paracetamol. This option highlights the potential risks associated with taking multiple products containing paracetamol.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Paracetamol is a medication that should only be taken when needed to relieve pain or fever, so it should not be used on a regular basis. Additionally, paracetamol can interact with other medications and increase the risk of adverse effects, such as liver damage. Therefore, patients should carefully follow the instructions provided by their healthcare provider and avoid taking paracetamol without medical supervision.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for an urgent reason for catheterizing a patient. This suggests that the patient is experiencing some kind of urinary emergency, such as acute urinary retention. In this case, catheterization would be necessary to relieve the obstruction and restore normal urine flow.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Catheterization is a procedure used to drain urine from the bladder, which is necessary for patients with incontinence who are unable to control their bladder function. Therefore, an urgent reason for catheterizing a patient would be acute urinary retention, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the number of 'true' movements available at the hip. A true movement refers to a movement that is not just a rotation around the joint, but rather a movement that involves actual displacement of the bone. With this understanding, let's examine the options. Option A states there are 4 true movements available at the hip. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of simultaneous movements. Option B states there are 5 true movements available at the hip. This is also incorrect because it still does not account for the possibility of simultaneous movements. Option C states there are 6 true movements available at the hip. This is correct because it accounts for the possibility of simultaneous movements. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The hip joint allows for a wide range of motion, including flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation, so there must be 5 true movements available at the hip. These are flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that plays a crucial role in glucose regulation and metabolism. The pancreas is responsible for secreting insulin into the bloodstream, where it helps to regulate blood sugar levels. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The pancreas.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The gastric parietal cells are responsible for producing digestive enzymes, and insulin is a crucial enzyme for breaking down sugars. Therefore, it's unlikely that the gastric parietal cells would be responsible for secreting insulin. On the other hand, the pancreas is an organ that plays a crucial role in glucose regulation, and it's well-known that the pancreas produces and secretes insulin. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: The pancreas.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Spastic paraplegia is a neurological disorder characterized by spasticity, weakness, and loss of coordination in the legs. The most common cause of this condition is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination and axonal damage. In this case, option A is the correct answer because multiple sclerosis can cause spastic paraplegia.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Spastic paraplegia involves muscle stiffness and hypertonia, so the tone wouldn't be flaccid; it would be closer to normal or even slightly elevated. Additionally, proprioception is the ability to sense the position and movement of one's body, which is not directly related to spasticity. Therefore, option B is incorrect.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's response is a physiological response to stress, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, injury, or surgery. The characteristic features of Cushing's response include increased blood pressure, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. In this case, the correct answer is B: High blood pressure, tachycardia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's response is a reaction to increased intracranial pressure, often leading to a state similar to shock, with low blood pressure and a slowed heart rate to compensate. Therefore, the correct answer is B: High blood pressure, tachycardia.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. During CPR, chest compressions are performed to maintain blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain and other vital organs. The American Heart Association recommends delivering chest compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute for adults. This is because this rate has been shown to be effective in maintaining blood flow and improving outcomes during cardiac arrest.",C,"Let's reason step by step. CPR guidelines need to be adaptable to various patient conditions and ages, so the compression rate would likely vary depending on the specific case. However, in general, chest compressions should be delivered at a rate of around 100-120 per minute, which is slightly faster than the recommended rate for adults.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hospital-acquired infections are a significant concern in healthcare settings. According to various studies, the second most common hospital-acquired infection is urinary tract infection (UTI). This is because UTIs can occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through catheters or other medical devices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hospitals are common breeding grounds for airborne illnesses, so upper respiratory tract infections are likely the second most frequent after urinary infections. Additionally, upper respiratory tract infections can be caused by a variety of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. When branched chain amino acids are deaminated in muscle, the ammonia produced is mostly converted into urea. This process occurs through the action of enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase and alanine transaminase. The resulting urea is then released from the muscle and excreted by the kidneys.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is toxic, so the muscle needs to convert it into a less harmful substance like arginine before releasing it into the bloodstream. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's Syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder caused by excessive production of cortisol hormone. One of the characteristic features of this condition is the presence of truncal obesity, which is not mentioned in option A. Option B mentions enlarged extremities, which is not a feature of Cushing's Syndrome. Options C and D are incorrect as well.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by high cortisol levels, which promotes tissue growth and strengthens bones, so osteoporosis wouldn't be a typical feature.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Abdominal pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammatory conditions such as appendicitis or diverticulitis, gastrointestinal infections such as food poisoning, and other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The location and character of the abdominal pain can help to narrow down the possible causes. For example, if the pain is severe and localized to one area of the abdomen, it may be indicative of a more serious condition such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. On the other hand, if the pain is milder and more diffuse, it may be indicative of a less serious condition such as IBS or IBD.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Irritable bowel syndrome affects the intestines, and pain originating from the intestines is usually well-localized and easy to pinpoint. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is a type of sugar that serves as the primary source of energy for many cells, including muscle cells. The process of glucose uptake into muscle cells involves several steps, including binding to specific receptors on the surface of the muscle cell, followed by internalization and degradation of the receptor-bound glucose. In this context, option A is the most accurate answer, as it correctly describes the mechanism of glucose transport into muscle cells.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is a type of monocarboxylic acid, and muscle cells utilize specific transporters for these acids to facilitate energy production. GLUT4 is one such transporter that plays a crucial role in glucose uptake in muscle cells. Therefore, the correct answer is A: via protein transporters called GLUT4.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The person's weight is given as 62 kg, and the drug dose is given as 15 mg/kg. To find out how many grams of the drug the person needs to take, we need to multiply the person's weight in kilograms with the drug dose in milligrams per kilogram. This gives us a total of 930 milligrams or 0.93 grams.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the dose is 15mg per kilogram and the person weighs 62kg, then the total dose is 930mg, which is also the dose in grams. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 930.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the primary hormone responsible for fluid regulation. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. ADH plays a crucial role in regulating water reabsorption in the kidneys, which helps to regulate blood volume and blood pressure. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ADH is primarily responsible for fluid regulation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels, which indirectly influences fluid balance in the body. However, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is primarily responsible for regulating water reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby controlling fluid balance and blood volume. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Antidiuretic hormone.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about a potential complication of IV therapy, which is described as 'Leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage'. This description suggests that the complication is related to the leakage of irritating substances into surrounding tissues. Based on this reasoning, the most likely answer is Extravasation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phlebitis involves inflammation of the vein due to irritation from the IV medication or catheter, causing tissue damage around the injection site. Extravasation, on the other hand, is a leakage of fluid into surrounding tissues, not necessarily caused by inflammation. Therefore, extravasation is the most likely answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Shampoo is a cleansing agent specifically designed for cleaning hair, scalp and beard. It is formulated to remove dirt, oil, sweat and other impurities from the hair and scalp. Using shampoo on the skin when showering or bathing would not be effective in removing dirt, oil, sweat and other impurities from the skin. Moreover, using shampoo on the skin can cause dryness, irritation, and even allergic reactions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Shampoo is designed to create a smooth and slippery texture, making it easier to spread and cleanse the hair and skin effectively. Using shampoo on the skin would not provide the same benefits as using soap or emollients, which are specifically designed for cleansing and moisturizing the skin. Additionally, using shampoo on the skin could potentially cause irritation, dryness, or other adverse reactions.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor that detects changes in muscle tension, particularly at the junction between muscle and tendon. This information helps the nervous system to adjust muscle force and movement accordingly. Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of the Golgi tendon organ.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Additionally, many women have started competing at the international level earlier than ever before, which has also contributed to the rapid improvement in women'’s world record performances.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Free fatty acids are produced through the breakdown of triglycerides in adipose tissue and other tissues. These free fatty acids are then transported in the blood, primarily bound to albumin, a protein produced by the liver. This binding allows for efficient transport of these important energy sources throughout the body.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells are responsible for transporting various substances throughout the body, including oxygen and nutrients like free fatty acids. However, most of these free fatty acids are not transported inside red blood cells but rather as lipoproteins, which are complexes of lipids and proteins that play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Adrenaline secretion from the adrenal glands is stimulated by increased sympathetic nerve activity. This increased activity triggers the release of adrenaline, which plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress and exercise.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As exercise intensity increases, the body relies more on fatty acids for energy, leading to increased plasma fatty acid levels that trigger adrenaline release from the adrenal glands. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'increased plasma fatty acids'.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Informal carers are individuals who provide unpaid care to family members, friends, or neighbors. As of 2020, it is estimated that one in six over 65s is providing some form of informal care. This suggests that a significant proportion of older adults rely on informal caregivers for support with daily living activities. Therefore, it is essential to include informal carers in discharge planning to ensure a smooth transition from hospital to home.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Discharge planning should primarily focus on medical professionals and formal care services to ensure a smooth transition for patients. Informal carers, such as family members or friends, play a crucial role in providing emotional support and practical assistance to patients. Therefore, it is essential to include informal carers in discharge planning to ensure that their needs are met and they can continue to provide vital support to the patient.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle cells have a unique mechanism to take up glucose and amino acids from the bloodstream. This process is stimulated by insulin, which binds to specific receptors on muscle cell surfaces. Insulin then triggers a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to increased glucose and amino acid uptake by muscle cells. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Insulin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol, like insulin, plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels and energy metabolism, making it likely to promote glucose uptake. Additionally, cortisol also promotes the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose, which can be used as an energy source. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Insulin.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which one of the following manoeuvres is not a central painful stimulus? Central painful stimuli are typically referred to as 'visceral pain'. Visceral pain is often described as dull, crampy or gnawing. With this in mind, let's examine each option: Supra-orbital ridge pressure (A) - This is a peripheral painful stimulus, not central. Pressure on the little finger pulp (B) - This is also a peripheral painful stimulus, not central. Trapezius squeeze (C) - This is another peripheral painful stimulus, not central. Sternal rub (D) - Ah, now this one could be considered a central painful stimulus! The sternal rub is a palpation technique used to stimulate the parietal pericardium, which can cause referred pain in the chest and back. Therefore, option D, 'Sternal rub', is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sternal rub involves applying pressure to the chest area, it's more likely to elicit a peripheral pain response rather than a central one. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Sternal rub.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. When examining the jugular venous pulse, it is necessary to relax the patient's neck muscles, as this can affect the accuracy of the examination. It is also important to time the pulsation with the radial pulse, as this helps to ensure that the examination is being performed correctly. Good lighting and having the patient lying at a 45-degree angle are not essential for examining the jugular venous pulse.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Clear visualization of the jugular venous pulse is crucial for accurate assessment, making good lighting a primary requirement. Relaxation of patient's neck muscles and proper positioning (patient lying at 45 degree angle) are also important factors to consider. However, timing the pulsation with the radial pulse is not necessary when examining the jugular venous pulse.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism within muscle cells. The activity of creatine kinase is directly related to the levels of ADP and ATP within the cell. When intracellular ADP rises, it binds to creatine kinase, leading to an increase in its activity. Therefore, option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When muscle pH falls, indicating increased acidity and potentially anaerobic conditions, the demand for ATP production rises, thus requiring higher creatine kinase activity. This is because creatine kinase plays a crucial role in regenerating ATP from ADP during high-intensity, short-duration activities such as sprinting or weightlifting.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the energy charge of a cell. This refers to the overall rate of energy use by the cell, not just the difference between the charge on the outside and inside of a cell. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The energy charge of a cell is related to its electrical properties, specifically the difference in charge between the intracellular and extracellular environments. This difference in charge drives the movement of ions across the cell membrane, which ultimately generates the energy charge of the cell.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Haemorrhoids are swollen veins in the lower rectum or anus. Bleeding from first-degree haemorrhoids is not typically associated with pain, as it usually occurs when the vein is stretched but not damaged. On the other hand, second-degree haemorrhoids can cause bleeding and discomfort, especially if they become thrombosed. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As haemorrhoids progress to more severe stages, they become increasingly difficult to return to their normal position within the anal canal. Therefore, it is logical that second degree haemorrhoids cannot be returned to the anal canal.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The ATP store in muscle is a limited energy source that can only supply energy for high-intensity exercise. This is because the ATP-PC system, which is responsible for generating ATP during high-intensity exercise, has a limited capacity to regenerate ATP. Therefore, the ATP store in muscle can only supply energy for high-intensity exercise for about 2 seconds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high energy requirements of intense exercise, ATP stores can likely provide fuel for around 10 seconds before other energy systems become dominant. This is because ATP-PC system has a limited capacity to replenish ATP stores during high-intensity exercise.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. For very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds, the initial energy source is from phosphocreatine stores. This is because creatine phosphorylation provides a rapid and efficient way to replenish ATP stores during high-intensity activities. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: phycocreatine stores.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Phosphocreatine serves as a readily available energy reserve, making it the primary source for short bursts of intense muscle activity. This is particularly true for high-force contractions lasting only 1-2 seconds, such as those required during weightlifting or sprinting. Therefore, the initial energy source for very high force contractions lasting 1-2 seconds is from phosphocreatine stores.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. With an increasing number of sprints, the anaerobic energy system is activated more frequently. This means that the anaerobic contribution to energy production progressively increases as the number of sprints increases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As the number of sprints increases, anaerobic metabolism becomes more prominent, resulting in a substantial decrease in muscle pH, potentially below 6.0. This is because anaerobic metabolism produces lactic acid as a byproduct, which accumulates in the muscles and blood. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'pH of the muscle falls below 6.0.'",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of the peripheral nervous system, which includes nerves outside of the central nervous system. In this case, the question asks about sensory loss in a stocking distribution. This is a characteristic feature of peripheral neuropathy, particularly in conditions such as diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral neuropathy affects the lower motor neurons, which can lead to muscle weakness and spasticity, resulting in increased tone in the legs. Additionally, reflexes may be decreased or absent due to damage to the peripheral nerves. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups refer to sites on an enzyme molecule where a cofactor or coenzyme binds, allowing the enzyme to function properly. These prosthetic groups can be tightly bound to the enzyme, as in the case of heme in hemoglobin, or loosely bound, as in the case of NAD+ in dehydrogenases. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Prosthetic groups are typically small molecules that associate with enzymes through relatively weak hydrogen bonds, allowing for dynamic interactions. They can also be involved in allosteric regulation of enzyme activity. Therefore, the correct answer is C: sites on the enzyme molecule that permit allosteric modification of enzyme activity.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks to name the carpal bones of the wrist. We can start by listing the eight carpal bones: scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, and capitate. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The carpal bones form the foundation of the wrist joint and include the radius, ulna, and several smaller bones like the scaphoid and lunate. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of these bones, including the scaphoid, lunate, triquetral, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training is a type of exercise that focuses on increasing the body's ability to sustain prolonged physical activity over time. This type of training typically involves low-to-moderate intensity exercises, such as distance running, cycling, or swimming, for extended periods of time. The primary goal of endurance training is to increase the muscle's capacity to generate energy aerobically, which allows the muscles to sustain prolonged physical activity without fatigue. In this case, the most appropriate answer is to generate energy aerobically.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance training primarily targets the aerobic energy system and muscle fiber adaptations, which can enhance the speed of muscle contractions. However, endurance training does not directly increase the speed of muscle contractions. Instead, it enhances the efficiency of energy production during prolonged exercise.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A Colles fracture is a type of distal radius fracture, which occurs when there is a break in the radius bone near the wrist. The term 'Colles' refers to the Irish surgeon Abraham Colles who first described this type of fracture in the 18th century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A Colles fracture involves a break in the radius bone near the wrist, which is closely connected to the elbow joint, making it essentially an elbow fracture. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Elbow fracture.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Chronic cough is a common symptom that can be caused by various factors, including respiratory infections, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and medication side effects. Sodium valproate is an anticonvulsant medication that is not typically associated with chronic cough. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is sodium valproate.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While smoking can cause various respiratory problems, chronic cough is not typically a direct consequence of long-term smoking. In fact, many smokers do not experience chronic cough. Therefore, option C is the most likely answer.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. The normal range of flexion at the knee joint is typically considered to be between 0 and 135 degrees. This range allows for a comfortable range of motion while also providing stability to the knee joint.,B,"Let's reason step by step. The knee joint allows for a moderate range of flexion, typically reaching up to 115 degrees, which is sufficient for most daily movements. Therefore, the 'normal' range of flexion at the knee joint would be around 0-115 degrees.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium metabolism is regulated by hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin. PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bones, while calcitonin inhibits the release of calcium from bones. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of PTH. This can lead to an increase in plasma calcium levels. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands, but rather is produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Oliguria is a symptom of hypercalcaemia, which occurs when there is an excess of calcium in the blood. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually asymptomatic.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcitonin is a hormone involved in calcium regulation, and its release leads to an increase in plasma calcium levels. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which can lead to elevated serum calcium levels. This condition is often asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as kidney stones, bone pain, and weakness. Therefore, option B is correct. Vitamin D is not secreted by the parathyroid glands. Instead, vitamin D is produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. The parathyroid glands produce PTH, which plays a crucial role in regulating calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Oliguria is a symptom of acute kidney injury, not hypercalcaemia. Hypercalcaemia can cause symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and weakness, but oliguria is not typically associated with this condition.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating an opening in the trachea, or windpipe, to facilitate breathing. This procedure may be necessary for patients who have difficulty breathing through their mouth and nose, such as those with severe respiratory failure or those who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: As an aid to weaning patients from a ventilator.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy involves creating an opening in the trachea to establish an alternate airway, which can assist with swallowing difficulties. However, this is not the primary indication for a tracheostomy. The most common indications are to aid weaning patients from a ventilator or as a temporary measure until other airway management options become available.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Coring is a term used in medicine and pharmacology. In this context, coring refers to the delivery of medication straight into the bloodstream. This is often done using a syringe or an infusion pump.",C,"Let's reason step by step. 'Coring' refers to the precise titration of a drug, where the dosage is gradually increased or decreased to reach the optimal level for the patient's needs. This process requires great care and attention to detail, as even small variations in dosage can have significant effects on the patient'’s health.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks how several different proteins can be produced from the same gene. This is a classic example of alternative RNA splicing, where the primary transcript of the gene can be spliced in various ways to produce different mRNAs. These different mRNAs can then be translated into different proteins.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the mRNA molecule is longer, it would contain more codons, which could code for different amino acids and therefore different proteins. However, this is not the correct answer because the length of the mRNA molecule does not directly determine the number of proteins produced from a gene.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The elbow is a joint that connects the humerus (upper arm bone) to the radius and ulna (forearm bones). It allows for flexion, extension, pronation, and supination movements. Based on its structure and function, it can be classified as a synovial hinge joint.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The elbow joint allows for a wide range of motion, similar to the shoulder, so it must be a ball and socket joint. However, this is not correct because the elbow joint does not allow for rotation in multiple planes like a ball and socket joint would. Instead, the elbow joint only allows for flexion and extension, which is characteristic of a synovial hinge joint.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that static stretches be held for at least 15-30 seconds to allow for maximum relaxation and flexibility gains. Therefore, the minimum time a stretch should be held for is 10-30 seconds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Holding a stretch for a short period of time, like 0-10 seconds, should be enough to increase flexibility. However, holding the stretch for too long can lead to muscle fatigue and potentially even injury. Therefore, it is recommended to hold stretches for at least 30-50 seconds to allow for maximum flexibility gains.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Radial nerve palsy is a type of peripheral neuropathy that affects the radial nerve, which runs from the neck down to the hand. The radial nerve provides sensation to the back of the hand and forearm, as well as controlling some of the muscles in the arm. In radial nerve palsy, there is damage or compression of the radial nerve, leading to numbness, tingling, and weakness in the affected areas. Based on this information, we can conclude that option C is correct, as it states that radial nerve palsy leads to wrist drop, which is a common symptom of radial nerve palsy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The radial nerve is located near the ulna bone, so it makes sense that damage to it would affect the medial side of the hand. Additionally, the radial nerve controls the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers, which are responsible for wrist extension and finger extension. Therefore, damage to the radial nerve would likely lead to wrist drop.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is a vital energy source for the body, and it can be synthesized from various precursors such as lactate, glycerol, or amino acids. The process of synthesizing glucose from these precursors is called gluconeogenesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The synthesis of glucose from other molecules sounds similar to the breakdown of lipids, so it must be lipolysis. However, lipolysis is the breakdown of triglycerides into glycerol and fatty acids, not the synthesis of glucose. Therefore, the correct answer is gluconeogenesis.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A surgical support can be used for a prolapsed stomas, which is when the stoma protrudes through the abdominal wall and requires additional support to prevent further complications. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: prolapsed stomas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A surgical support would help hold the stoma in place, which is necessary when it is prolapsed. This means that option A is the most appropriate answer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the detection of a change in blood pressure. This suggests that we are looking for sensors or receptors that can detect changes in blood pressure. Among the options, baroreceptors are the most likely candidates to detect changes in blood pressure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The vasomotor center is responsible for controlling blood vessel diameter, so it must be the one detecting changes in blood pressure. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dentures are removable dental appliances that replace missing teeth. It is generally recommended to remove dentures at night and clean them thoroughly before storing them in a named pot or container filled with water or a denture cleaner. This helps prevent bacterial growth, keeps the dentures clean and fresh, and prevents any unpleasant odors from developing.",D,"Let's reason step by step. It's crucial to identify whose dentures are whose, so storing them in a named pot is essential, even if it means they dry out. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A palpable left parasternal impulse suggests that the impulse is felt on the left side of the chest, just below the clavicle. This type of impulse is typically seen in conditions where there is increased pressure or volume in the right ventricle, such as pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot. In this case, the most appropriate answer is a right ventricular hypertrophy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A palpable impulse on the left side of the sternum suggests increased activity in the nearby aortic valve, likely due to regurgitation. This is because the aortic valve is located just above the left ventricle and below the aortic arch, making it susceptible to regurgitation if there is any damage or disease affecting the valve.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the assessment of power in the arms, specifically regarding the triceps muscle and the C5 nerve root. From this information, we can deduce that flexion at the elbow is produced by the biceps muscle, not the triceps muscle. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Additionally, the question also mentions the MRC scale for assessing power in the arms. According to the MRC scale, grade 3/5 represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated. This information helps us eliminate options A and D as they do not accurately describe the MRC scale. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Grade 3 on the MRC scale means the muscle can move against gravity, so eliminating gravity would allow for even greater movement. This is consistent with the statement that grade 3/5 represents movement of the arm only when gravity is eliminated.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about abnormal breathing patterns seen in head injury and altered conscious level. Ataxic breathing refers to a normal, rhythmic pattern of breathing that is not affected by the patient's level of consciousness or their underlying medical condition. Therefore, ataxic breathing is not an abnormal breathing pattern seen in head injury and altered conscious level.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperventilation is a common response to anxiety and panic, not typically associated with head injuries. Ataxic breathing, on the other hand, is an abnormal breathing pattern characterized by irregular and disordered breathing patterns, which can be seen in patients with altered conscious level or those who have suffered from head injury.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which feature suggests that a pulsation in the neck is arterial. An arterial pulse is typically characterized by a strong, rapid, and rhythmic pulse. In this case, option D 'Pressure in the root of the neck reduces the impulse' suggests that the pulsation is arterial because pressure at the root of the neck (the carotid sinus) can reduce the impulse or amplitude of an arterial pulse.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Applying pressure to the root of the neck would restrict blood flow in the jugular vein, thus reducing the venous pulsation. This is a characteristic feature that suggests the pulsation in the neck is arterial rather than venous.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Haematemesis refers to the vomiting of blood or coffee ground-like material. This can be a sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be caused by various factors such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and esophagitis. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Haematemesis can have various causes, so focusing solely on vital signs and abdominal pain is sufficient for diagnosis, regardless of alcohol history. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are the primary source of energy for cells, particularly in the heart and skeletal muscles. To be used as an energy source, fatty acids must first be transported into the mitochondria, where they can undergo beta-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA, which is then fed into the citric acid cycle to generate ATP.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule in fatty acid metabolism, so it makes sense that it would also be involved in their transport into the mitochondria. Coenzyme A (CoA) plays a crucial role in many metabolic pathways, including fatty acid metabolism. Therefore, it's likely that CoA is involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The best approach to the use of analgesic drugs following surgery is to provide a balance between providing adequate pain relief and minimizing the risk of adverse effects, such as respiratory depression or constipation. This can be achieved by giving drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain. This approach allows for flexibility in managing pain while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Giving analgesics only when pain scores are high helps avoid unnecessary medication and potential side effects. However, this approach may not provide adequate pain relief for patients who require consistent pain management. Therefore, the best approach is to give drugs regularly with provision for additional 'as required' pain relief for breakthrough pain.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. If a transfusion reaction is suspected, it's crucial to take immediate action to prevent further complications. The correct answer is A: turn off the transfusion, inform medical staff immediately, and follow transfusion policy advice on dealing with acute transfusion reactions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The first step in handling a potential transfusion reaction is to remove the source of the problem, which is the blood bag itself. This is why option C is the correct answer. Disconnecting and disposing of the blood bag immediately will prevent any further exposure to the potentially contaminated blood.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by focal areas of increased bone turnover, leading to deformity and pain. The characteristic features of Paget's disease include bowing or thickening of affected bones, particularly the long bones of the legs. Therefore, option A is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The characteristic bowing of long bones in Paget's disease may cause pain and mobility issues, but the bones remain strong enough to prevent fractures. Therefore, option A is incorrect. On the other hand, spinal cord compression can occur due to the expansion of affected vertebrae, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or paralysis. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The daily dose is the total amount of the drug taken in a day, divided into two equal parts because it's prescribed every 12 hours. So, we need to find half of the total amount. The total amount is 960 mg, so half of that would be 480 mg. However, this is not one of the options. Let's look at each option and see which one is closest to 480 mg.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the patient takes 960 mg every 12 hours, then the daily dose is simply double that amount, which is 1920 mg or 1920 grams. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1920.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is a complex phenomenon that involves various physiological and biochemical changes. One of the key factors thought to be implicated in the development of peripheral muscle fatigue is an accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) within the muscles. This occurs as a result of the breakdown of ATP during high-intensity exercise, leading to an increase in Pi levels. As Pi accumulates, it can bind to and inhibit the activity of key enzymes involved in energy metabolism, further exacerbating peripheral muscle fatigue.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Potassium is essential for muscle contractions, so a deficiency could lead to fatigue during intense activities. Additionally, an accumulation of inorganic phosphate can also contribute to the development of peripheral muscle fatigue. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: A lack of potassium.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Passive movements refer to movements that are performed without any conscious effort or control. In other words, the movement is not initiated or controlled by the individual performing it. Instead, the movement is often triggered by external stimuli, such as gravity or a therapist's guidance. Examples of passive movements include exercises done while lying down or sitting in a chair, where the individual does not have to actively move their body parts.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Passive movements involve moving a joint through its range of motion, even if it requires some resistance to achieve full stretch. This type of movement is often used in physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve flexibility and range of motion. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Facial nerve palsy, also known as Bell's palsy, is a condition that affects the facial nerve, which controls the muscles on one side of the face. The symptoms of facial nerve palsy typically include weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles, resulting in an inability to control facial expressions such as smiling, frowning, and raising an eyebrow. In addition, patients with facial nerve palsy may also experience difficulty eating, drinking, and speaking due to the weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles. The most common cause of facial nerve palsy is a viral infection, although it can also be caused by other factors such as trauma, surgery, or certain medical conditions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bell's palsy is a condition that affects the facial nerve, causing weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles, which is a characteristic of an upper motor neurone lesion. The other options are incorrect because they describe different conditions or lesions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power refers to the highest rate at which an athlete can maintain their performance over a prolonged period of time, such as during a race. In this case, the correct answer is B: 'declines with the distance of the race.' This is because the maximum sustainable power typically decreases as the duration of the exercise increases.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power is the highest level of effort an athlete can maintain over a prolonged period, so it should remain relatively constant during a race. This is because the body's energy stores are depleted at a steady rate, allowing the athlete to maintain their pace. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Antibiotics are typically used to treat bacterial infections, not viral or fungal infections. In this case, antibiotics would be used prior to catheterization if there is a high risk of introducing bacteria into the urinary tract during the procedure. This could include patients with a history of urinary tract infections, those who have had previous catheterizations, or those who are immunocompromised.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Catheterization carries a risk of introducing bacteria into the urinary tract, so using antibiotics beforehand would help prevent urinary tract infections. The correct answer is B: If the patient does not have urinary tract infection.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Wound drainage should be assessed for volume and consistency to ensure that the wound is healing properly. The frequency of assessment depends on the type of wound, its size, and the patient's overall condition. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'daily', as it provides a regular and consistent assessment of the wound drainage.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Daily wound assessments are a standard practice in post-operative care, providing enough information to monitor the healing process and detect any issues with drainage. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is daily.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A stoma is a surgically created opening in the abdomen, typically used for patients with bowel obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease. The ideal location of a stoma depends on several factors, including the patient's body habitus, the type and extent of the underlying condition, and the surgeon's personal preference. In general, the stoma should be located in an area that is easily accessible for pouch changes and is not prone to irritation or skin breakdown.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Placing the stoma near the umbilicus makes it easily accessible for cleaning and changing the appliance, which is important for maintaining hygiene and preventing skin irritation. Additionally, placing the stoma in this location can also help to reduce the risk of herniation at the stoma site.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the \u03b2-oxidation of palmitic acid, which is a fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms. During this process, one molecule of palmitic acid reacts with oxygen to produce one molecule of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of carbon dioxide. Therefore, the correct answer is A: yields 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA and some ATP and water.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid has 16 carbon atoms, and each cycle of beta-oxidation removes two carbons, so the process should yield 16 molecules of acetyl-CoA. Additionally, some ATP and water are also produced.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about what to expect before undergoing a painful procedure. This suggests that the patient's anxiety and perceived pain intensity are important factors to consider. Therefore, it is likely that informing patients about what to expect and how their pain will be controlled will lead to a reduction in anxiety and perceived pain intensity. This is supported by option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Providing information about a painful procedure can help patients feel more relaxed and less anxious, which can lead to a decrease in stress hormones and an increase in urine output.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'all subcellular compartments'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. When the left ventricle contracts, it pumps blood into the aorta and other arteries. However, between contractions of the left ventricle, the blood continues to flow through the vessels due to the elastic recoil of the arteries. This is because the arteries are not completely relaxed during diastole, but instead maintain some degree of tone, which allows them to recoil elastically and continue to propel blood forward.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Blood vessels contract and relax to regulate blood flow, so the contraction of vessels between left ventricle contractions would help maintain blood flow through the circulatory system. The correct answer is D: 'the arteries have elastic recoil.'",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. A normal heart rate for an adult at rest is typically considered to be between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm).

B,"Let's reason step by step. FADH2 and NADH+H are electron carriers that play a crucial role in cellular respiration, the process of generating energy from glucose. When these electron carriers donate their electrons to the electron transport chain, they release energy that is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient is then used to drive the production of ATP through the process of chemiosmosis. In this case, the correct answer is 32 ATP.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Each molecule of FADH2 and NADH+H carries a significant amount of energy, sufficient to generate multiple ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, the energy released from the breakdown of glucose during glycolysis is used to generate 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. The remaining energy is then transferred to the electron transport chain, where it is used to generate additional ATP molecules through oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, based on the energy yield from the breakdown of glucose during glycolysis and the subsequent transfer of energy to the electron transport chain, we can conclude that the correct answer is 2 ATP.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the proportional contribution of different energy systems during exercise. As the intensity of exercise increases, the body relies more heavily on anaerobic energy production. This is because anaerobic metabolism can produce ATP quickly and efficiently, even in the absence of oxygen. In contrast, aerobic metabolism requires oxygen to generate ATP, and is therefore less effective at high intensities. Therefore, as the intensity of exercise increases, the proportional contribution of anaerobic energy production will increase, while the proportional contribution of aerobic energy production will decrease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As exercise intensity increases, the body requires more ATP, and the TCA cycle plays a crucial role in aerobic ATP production, so its contribution should also increase proportionally. On the other hand, anaerobic energy production is primarily used for short-duration, high-intensity activities, such as sprinting or weightlifting, which are not typically associated with long-duration exercise like endurance running. Therefore, the higher intensity of exercise would lead to a greater proportional contribution from aerobic energy production, specifically the TCA cycle.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body's energy demands increase significantly. To meet these increased energy demands, the body breaks down stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. This process is known as glycogenolysis. As a result of this process, blood glucose concentrations typically rise during and immediately after high-intensity exercise. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body tightly regulates blood glucose levels, and during exercise, glucose uptake by muscles is balanced by glucose release from the liver, so blood glucose concentration should remain relatively unchanged. However, during high-intensity exercise, muscle glycogen breakdown can lead to a temporary increase in blood glucose concentration. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect that blood glucose concentration may rise slightly during 80-90 minutes of intermittent high-intensity exercise.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The pH of water is a measure of its acidity or basicity. Pure water has a neutral pH, which is 7. Since the options provided are all integers, and we know that the pH of pure water is 7, it's most likely that the correct answer is B: 7.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A pH of 7 is neutral, and water is a very strong substance, so it must have a high pH. However, the correct answer is actually B: 7, which means that the pH of water is indeed neutral.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. When recording a peak flow rate, it's essential to stand or sit as upright as possible. This is because the lungs are designed to expand and contract more efficiently when we're standing or sitting upright. By doing so, we can ensure that our lung function is accurately measured, which is crucial for diagnosing and managing respiratory conditions such as asthma.",A,"Let's reason step by step. It's important for the healthcare professional to have a clear view of the patient's breathing technique to ensure they're doing it correctly. This is especially crucial when recording peak flow rates, as small variations in technique can affect the accuracy of the reading. Therefore, having the patient stand or sit upright as possible allows the healthcare professional to observe and assess their breathing technique more effectively.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks why a short-acting bronchodilator should be taken first. This implies that there are other medications or treatments involved, and we need to take this medication in a specific order. The correct answer is A: It works to dilate the airways quickly, allowing better deposition of other medications.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Medications are often color-coded to indicate the order they should be taken, so the short-acting bronchodilator should be taken first because it's likely a different color. This allows for better deposition of other medications and ensures that the medication is working effectively.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Psoriatic arthropathy is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects some people with psoriasis. The key feature of this condition is the presence of inflammation in the joints, which can lead to joint pain and stiffness. In this case, option C is the most accurate answer because it states that 'Tophi can sometimes be seen over affected joints'. Tophi are small nodules that form on the skin or in the joints as a result of chronic inflammation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Psoriatic arthropathy is a type of inflammatory arthritis, and gout is also inflammatory, so tophi could be present in both conditions. However, psoriasis typically involves skin lesions, whereas gout typically does not involve skin lesions. Therefore, the presence of tophi would be more consistent with gout than with psoriatic arthropathy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the neck and creating an opening in the trachea, which is the windpipe. This allows for direct access to the lungs for breathing purposes. The correct answer is A: An opening in the anterior wall of the trachea above the cricoid cartilage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The cricoid cartilage is a ring-shaped structure, and rings are usually found on the back of things, so the tracheostomy must be on the posterior wall below the cricoid cartilage. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Morphine is an opioid medication that is commonly used to treat moderate to severe pain. The effects of morphine can be broadly categorized into two main categories: analgesic and sedative effects. The analgesic effect of morphine reduces the intensity of pain, while the sedative effect causes drowsiness or sleepiness. Based on this information, we can conclude that option B is the most accurate description of the effects of morphine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If morphine reduces pain, it would make the patient feel better and more energetic, so it should also increase alertness. However, morphine is an opioid analgesic that can cause sedation, drowsiness, and respiratory depression as its primary effects. Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of the effects of morphine.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. During multiple sprint sports, the body undergoes intense physical stress, leading to increased production of ADP degradation products. These products include ammonia, hypoxanthine, uric acid, urea and creatinine. Among these products, ammonia, urea and uric acid are the most relevant ones that increase in concentration during multiple sprint sports.",A,"Let's reason step by step. ADP is used for energy, and urea is a waste product of energy metabolism, so it makes sense that urea would increase along with ammonia and uric acid during intense exercise. Creatinine is also a waste product of muscle breakdown, but it's not directly related to energy metabolism, so it's less likely to be affected by ADP degradation.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Fatigue in high intensity exercise is a common phenomenon that can be attributed to various factors. One fundamental cause of fatigue is the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand. During high-intensity exercise, the muscle cells require a rapid and sustained release of ATP to fuel their contractions. However, the rate at which ATP is produced by the mitochondria may not be able to keep pace with the rapidly increasing demands for ATP during high-intensity exercise. As a result, fatigue sets in as the muscle cells are unable to sustain the high levels of contraction required to maintain the desired level of performance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. ATP is the energy currency of the cell, so any inhibition of its production would naturally lead to fatigue during exercise. Additionally, a failure of the ATP supply to match the demand would also result in fatigue as the muscles are unable to generate sufficient force to maintain movement.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A keloid is a type of raised, thickened scar that forms as a result of an injury or trauma to the skin. It is characterized by its firm, rubbery texture and its tendency to grow beyond the boundaries of the original wound. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'a firm mass of scar tissue.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. Keloids are scars, and scars form when wounds heal improperly, so removing a drain too soon could disrupt healing and lead to a keloid. However, this option does not directly relate to the definition of a keloid.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Cyanosis is a condition characterized by a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes, typically due to inadequate oxygen supply. In this case, if a patient is cyanosed, it suggests that their oxygen saturation level might be low. The most likely answer would be C: 80% or below.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cyanosis means the patient isn't getting enough oxygen, but 94% saturation is still quite high, so they wouldn't be cyanosed. The correct answer would be below 80%, which indicates severe hypoxia and cyanosis.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Eccrine and apocrine glands are both types of sweat glands, which produce sweat in response to heat, exercise, or emotional stimuli. Therefore, the correct answer is A: sweat glands.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Eccrine and apocrine glands are located near the eyes and face, similar to tear ducts, so they might be related. However, eccrine and apocrine glands are actually types of sweat glands, which produce sweat in response to heat or other stimuli. Therefore, the correct answer is A: sweat glands.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. After translation, protein structure can be modified through various post-translational modifications (PTMs). These PTMs include lipidation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, and attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. However, the process that is not used to modify protein structure after translation has occurred is B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. This is because attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds occurs during translation, not after translation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lipidation sounds like it involves adding lipids, which are similar to amino acids, so it could be a way to modify protein structure by adding more building blocks. Glycosylation is another process that adds carbohydrates to proteins or lipids, and phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate groups to molecules. Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds is not a common biological process, but rather an exception. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Graves Disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It causes hyperthyroidism, which leads to a range of symptoms including weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and bulging eyes. The most distinctive feature of Grave's disease is the characteristic 'Derbyshire Neck', which is caused by the protrusion of the larynx due to muscle wasting. In this case, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Autoimmune diseases often affect men more than women, and Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition, so it's likely more common in males. Additionally, the symptoms of Graves' disease are typically not limited to ophthalmoplegia or a large multi-nodular goitre, but rather can manifest in various ways, including hyperthyroidism, which may cause weight loss, heat intolerance, and other symptoms.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a molecule is completely oxidized in the body, it releases energy in the form of ATP. The amount of energy released depends on the molecular structure and the number of bonds broken during oxidation. Among the options provided, one gram of glucose (A) releases the most energy when completely oxidized in the body. This is because glucose is a simple sugar that can be easily converted into pyruvate through glycolysis, releasing a significant amount of ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Leucine is an amino acid, and protein provides energy, so leucine must release a lot of energy when oxidized. In contrast, glucose is a simple sugar that releases a relatively small amount of energy when oxidized. Palmitic acid is a fatty acid that releases a moderate amount of energy when oxidized. Finally, alcohol is a simple molecule that releases very little energy when oxidized. Therefore, leucine releases the most energy when completely oxidised in the body.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a widely used scale to assess the severity of traumatic brain injury. The scale has three main categories: eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response. Therefore, pupil response is not one of the categories used in the Glasgow Coma Scale.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses neurological function, and pupil response is a key indicator of neurological status, so it should be included in the scale. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Pupil response.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, and this energy is provided by ATP (adenosine triphosphate). When a muscle contracts, it uses up some of its stored ATP, which is then replenished through cellular respiration. Therefore, the correct answer is A: ATP.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Muscles need energy to contract, and ADP is an energy molecule, so it must be the source of energy for muscle contraction. ATP is also an energy molecule, but it's not directly involved in muscle contraction. Instead, it's a storage form of energy that can be converted into ADP when needed.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) is a lifesaving procedure that is performed in emergency situations where a person's heart has stopped beating or is not pumping enough blood to sustain life. The optimum position for performing CPR is to position the patient on their back on a firm surface, with the head and neck in a neutral position. This allows the rescuer to perform chest compressions and rescue breaths effectively.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During CPR, it's important for the patient to be comfortable, and a semi-recumbent position is often more comfortable than lying flat. Additionally, this position allows for better chest compressions and ventilation.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A blackout refers to a sudden and temporary loss of consciousness, often accompanied by a feeling of faintness or dizziness. In this context, option B 'Pre-syncope is another term for a blackout' is incorrect because pre-syncope refers specifically to the period immediately before syncope (fainting), whereas a blackout can occur without necessarily preceding syncope. Option A 'Confusion following a blackout is strongly suggestive of a fit' is also incorrect because confusion following a blackout does not necessarily imply that it was caused by an epileptic fit. Options C and D are also incorrect for similar reasons.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Blackouts and dizziness are usually related to neurological issues, so checking blood sugar wouldn't provide any useful information. An epileptic fit always leads to the loss of consciousness, which is a key feature of blackouts. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about possible rectal findings, which could include abnormalities in the prostate gland or rectum itself. Option A is incorrect because a palpable median groove in the prostate is not an adverse finding. In fact, it's a normal anatomical feature. Option B is correct because impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour. Option C is incorrect because a thrombosed haemorrhoid is typically painful. Finally, option D is incorrect because peri-anal warts can indeed be demonstrated on proctoscopy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A groove in the prostate doesn't sound normal, so it's likely an adverse finding that requires further investigation. Impacted faeces can sometimes cause symptoms similar to a rectal tumour, but this is not the case here. Thrombosed haemorrhoids are typically painful, and peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy. Therefore, option A is the most likely correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which option is not associated with an increase in the work of breathing. The options are: rise in respiratory rate, noisy breathing, increase in the use of accessory muscles, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Among these options, only 'a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute' is not necessarily associated with an increase in the work of breathing. A normal respiratory rate can be anywhere from 12 to 20 breaths per minute, so a rate of 16 breaths per minute is actually within this range. Therefore, the correct answer is 'D: A respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.'",D,"Let's reason step by step. Using accessory muscles means the body is working harder to breathe, which suggests a higher capacity for air intake. This could be due to various factors such as increased metabolic rate, fever, or respiratory disease. However, an increase in respiratory rate alone does not necessarily indicate an increase in work of breathing. Noisy breathing can occur due to various reasons such as laryngeal edema, vocal cord lesions, or foreign body aspiration. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'Noisy breathing.'",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following statements is true. Statement A claims that increasing protein intake above 3 grams per kg body mass per day will stimulate muscle growth and increase strength. However, this statement is false because there is no scientific evidence to support it. On the other hand, statement B claims that creatine supplements can increase muscle strength and power. This statement is true because numerous studies have consistently shown that creatine supplementation can increase muscle strength and power in both healthy individuals and athletes. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage occurs when the muscle is contracting and shortening under a load, as in a bicep curl exercise. This type of contraction causes micro-tears in the muscle fibers, leading to muscle soreness and stiffness. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. RNA is a type of nucleic acid that contains the genetic instructions used in the development and function of all living organisms. The four nucleotide bases found in RNA are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Therefore, thymine (T) is not found in RNA.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Adenine is a nucleotide base that pairs with thymine in DNA, so it is not found in RNA. The other options are all found in RNA.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the spine, and we need to choose the correct statement from the options provided. Option B states that Schober's test is designed to quantify the flexion of the lumbar spine. This is a true statement, as Schober's test is indeed used to measure the range of motion in the lumbar spine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy, the woman's center of gravity shifts forward, which leads to a loss of the natural lordosis of the lumbar spine. This is a normal and temporary change that occurs during pregnancy.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. When developing a plan of care relating to the management of a person's pain, it is essential to consider multiple aspects. The plan should address not only physical needs but also psychological and pharmacological ones. This comprehensive approach ensures that the individual's overall well-being is taken into account. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 'physical, psychological, and pharmacological needs followed by regular reassessment.'",C,"Let's reason step by step. The most crucial aspect of pain management is to minimize the potential side effects of pain medication, as these can often outweigh the benefits. Therefore, it is essential to consider not only physical and pharmacological needs but also psychological and social factors that may impact an individual's overall well-being. This approach ensures a comprehensive plan of care that addresses all aspects of an individual's health and well-being.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy released from the breakdown of high-energy phosphates, ATP and phosphocreatine, is used to sustain maximal exertion exercise. This energy release can only sustain exercise for a short period of time before the energy stores are depleted. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 1-2 seconds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of ATP and phosphocreatine provides a rapid burst of energy, sufficient to sustain maximal exertion for approximately 30-40 seconds. This is because the high-energy phosphates are rapidly replenished through anaerobic glycolysis, allowing for repeated short bursts of activity.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In a sensory assessment of the arm, we are trying to evaluate the different types of sensations that can be perceived in the arm. The question is asking which of the following statements is true in this context. Statement A suggests that it is acceptable to test pain with a venepuncture needle, which is not correct as this would cause unnecessary harm and discomfort to the patient. Statement B suggests that proprioception is appreciated via the same tracts as light touch, which is also not correct as proprioception is mediated by sensory receptors in muscles, tendons, and joints, whereas light touch is mediated by mechanoreceptors in the skin. Statement C suggests that it is best to test vibration sense with a 256 Hz tuning fork, which is also not correct as the frequency of the tuning fork used for testing vibration sense typically ranges from 128 Hz to 2048 Hz, depending on the specific type of vibration being tested. Finally, statement D suggests that impulses for pain travel principally up the dorsal columns, which is also not correct as pain signals are transmitted primarily through the spinothalamic tract, which is a separate pathway from the dorsal columns.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To accurately assess the sensation of pain in the arm, a sharp stimulus like a venepuncture needle can be used to evoke a clear response. This is because the nerve endings responsible for transmitting pain signals are sensitive to sharp stimuli. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Addison's disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. The most common symptoms of Addison's disease are fatigue, weakness, weight loss, low blood pressure, and darkening of the skin. In this case, the correct answer is C: It is a recognized cause of hypertension.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Addison's disease is caused by a deficiency in the hormone prolactin, which leads to various symptoms including fatigue and low blood pressure. The correct answer is C: It is a recognized cause of hypertension.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the number of attempts to cannulate a patient before passing the job on to a senior colleague. According to the medical knowledge of 2020, it is recommended that healthcare providers make at least 2-3 attempts to cannulate a patient before considering alternative options or seeking assistance from a senior colleague. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. It's generally acceptable to make up to four attempts at cannulating a patient before seeking assistance from a senior colleague. This is because the first few attempts are often exploratory, and it may take some time to develop a clear understanding of the patient's anatomy. Additionally, making multiple attempts can help to avoid complications such as bleeding or infection. Therefore, in this case, the correct answer is 4.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In glycolysis, the net production of ATP is a result of substrate-level phosphorylation. This process occurs when the energy released from the breakdown of glucose is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The net production of ATP is therefore equal to the number of molecules of glucose that are broken down minus the number of molecules of glycogen that are synthesized. In this case, the correct answer is 2 from glucose and 0 from glycogen.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycolysis generates a net gain of 3 ATP molecules from glucose and 4 ATP molecules from glycogen through substrate-level phosphorylation. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 3 from glucose and 4 from glycogen.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The trachea is a tube that carries air from the nose and mouth to the lungs. Any condition that causes swelling, inflammation or compression of the trachea can cause deviation of the trachea. In this case, the most likely cause of deviation of the trachea is previous tuberculosis of the right upper lobe.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Even a small pleural effusion on the right side can cause a noticeable deviation of the trachea due to the pressure it exerts on the surrounding structures. In this case, option B is the most likely answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hypernatraemic dehydration refers to a condition where the sodium level in the blood becomes extremely high, often above 160 mmol/L. This can occur due to various reasons such as excessive sodium intake, vomiting, diarrhea, or certain medications. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A: water intake is less than is needed to maintain balance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hypernatraemic dehydration typically occurs after surgery due to fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances, leading to a higher concentration of sodium in the blood. Therefore, option D: 'blood volume is lost due to surgery.' is the most appropriate answer.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The publication 'Your guide to the NHS' is written for patients, providing them with information about the National Health Service (NHS) and how it works. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the general public.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The publication 'Your guide to the NHS' is likely intended for patients admitted to the hospital, providing them with information about the services and procedures they may encounter. This makes option D, 'Patients admitted to hospital', the most appropriate answer.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. When taking a musculoskeletal history, it's essential to gather information about the patient's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle factors. In this case, difficulty rising from a chair is not diagnostic of polymyalgic rheumatica. Instead, it could be related to various other conditions such as osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, or even neurological disorders. Therefore, it's essential to gather more information about the patient's symptoms and medical history before making any conclusions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A history of diarrhea is not relevant when taking a musculoskeletal history, as it pertains to the digestive system and not the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, option B is true.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A cannula is a medical device used for injecting or withdrawing fluids from the body. The length of time a cannula can remain in situ depends on various factors, including the type and size of the cannula, the location where it is inserted, and the individual's overall health status. In general, a cannula can typically remain in situ for up to 48 hours, but this may vary depending on the specific circumstances.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To minimize the risk of infection and complications, a cannula should generally be replaced every 36 hours. This allows for regular monitoring of the patient's condition and minimizes the risk of complications such as infection or bleeding.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the rate of dopamine prescription, which is 4 micrograms/kg/minute. We need to find out how many milligrams will a 65 kg person receive in an hour. To do this, we first need to convert the rate from micrograms per kilogram per minute to milligrams per kilogram per minute. This can be done by multiplying the given rate by 1000 (since there are 1000 micrograms in one milligram). Therefore, the rate becomes 4000 milligrams per kilogram per minute. Now we need to find out how many milligrams will a 65 kg person receive in an hour. To do this, we can multiply the given weight by the given rate and then convert it from milligrams per kilogram per minute to milligrams per hour. Therefore, the total amount of dopamine that a 65 kg person will receive in an hour is equal to 65 * 4000 / 60 = 15600 milligrams.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If dopamine is administered at 4 micrograms/kg/min, a 65 kg person would receive 15600 milligrams in an hour. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 15600.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Endurance events such as the marathon race require sustained energy production over a prolonged period. The physiological characteristics that are important for success in endurance events include the ability to regulate body temperature, supply oxygen to exercising muscles, and utilize stored energy sources such as glycogen and fat. However, muscle ATP and phosphocreatine content is not directly related to endurance performance. While it may be indirectly beneficial due to its role in high-intensity exercise, it is not a critical factor for success in endurance events.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ability to regulate body temperature is the most critical physiological characteristic for success in endurance events like marathons, as overheating can significantly impair performance. In contrast, the other options are not as crucial for endurance performance.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the difference between a male and a female catheter. A catheter is a medical device used to drain or inject fluids into the body. Male and female catheters are designed differently because of anatomical differences between males and females. For example, male catheters need to be longer than female catheters because the urethra in males is longer than in females. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'Male catheters are longer than female catheters.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. Male catheters are typically larger in diameter than female catheters to accommodate the anatomical differences in the urethra. However, there is no significant difference in length between male and female catheters. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The assessment of arm reflexes involves tapping specific tendons to elicit reflex responses. The root value of the biceps reflex is indeed C5, C6. Additionally, if no reflex is elicited when you tap a tendon it is documented as absent. Furthermore, the triceps tendon is struck in the olecranon fossa, not the antecubital fossa. Finally, brisk finger jerks do confirm a lower motor neurone lesion.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. A bladder washout is a procedure where the patient's urinary tract is flushed with sterile water to remove any bacteria, debris or other contaminants that may be present in the urinary tract. This procedure is typically performed when there is a risk of infection or contamination in the urinary tract. In this case, the reason for performing a bladder washout at home would be to prevent the risk of infection or contamination in the urinary tract.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A bladder washout is performed to maintain hygiene and cleanliness within the urinary system, so it would be necessary when the urine is clear, indicating a potential buildup of waste. In this case, the most appropriate answer is 'When their urine is clear.'",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. When it comes to cleaning teeth, a small amount of toothpaste is recommended. This is because too much toothpaste can be abrasive and damage the enamel on your teeth. On the other hand, using too little toothpaste may not effectively clean your teeth. Therefore, the American Dental Association recommends using a pea-sized amount of toothpaste when brushing your teeth.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The amount of toothpaste needed should correspond to the size of the cleaning tool, so it makes sense that it should be similar to the length of the toothbrush to ensure adequate coverage. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The auscultatory gap refers to the period of silence that occurs between the systolic and diastolic phases of blood pressure measurement using a sphygmomanometer. This gap is caused by the cuff being inflated above the diastolic pressure, which prevents any Korotkoff sounds from being heard. Therefore, the correct answer is A: when you can no longer hear the Korotkoff sounds because the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The auscultatory gap refers to an anomaly in blood pressure measurement, so it must be related to the Korotkoff sounds not disappearing as expected when the cuff is fully deflated.

C,"Let's reason step by step. An intention tremor is a type of tremor that occurs when the patient intentionally moves their hand or arm. This type of tremor is often seen in patients with cerebellar lesions, such as those caused by stroke, trauma, or tumors. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Intention tremor, as the name suggests, is related to intentional movement, so it would be most noticeable and worse at rest, similar to the tremors seen in Parkinson's disease. However, intention tremor is not caused by Parkinson's disease, but rather by a cerebellar lesion or other conditions that affect the cerebellum.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The smallest increments on a mercury and aneroid sphygmomanometer measure are the units of pressure that can be accurately measured. In this case, the correct answer is 2 mmHg., as it is the smallest unit of measurement for blood pressure.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, it is crucial to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly and adjust their treatment plan accordingly.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A thyroid swelling can be caused by various factors, including inflammation, infection, or a benign or malignant tumor. The question asks which of the options is true about a thyroid swelling. Option C states that an ultrasound of the swelling is the best test to determine whether the nodule is actively secreting hormone. This option is not entirely accurate because while ultrasound can provide information about the size and shape of the thyroid gland, it may not be able to definitively determine whether a nodule is actively secreting hormone. Therefore, this option is not entirely true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lymph node enlargement indicates an active immune response, which is generally a good sign in fighting off diseases, including cancer.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The creatine kinase reaction is a reversible reaction that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, particularly during high-intensity activities such as sprinting or weightlifting. This reaction is not inhibited by low pH in the muscle, which means it can occur even under conditions of acidosis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Many enzymatic reactions in metabolism are irreversible to ensure a unidirectional flow of energy and metabolites, so the creatine kinase reaction likely follows the same principle. Additionally, creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and relaxation, so it's unlikely that its activity would be inhibited by low pH in the muscle.",A

Therefore, the correct answer is A: an excess of creatine.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hyperventilation leads to excessive elimination of carbon dioxide, which can disrupt the acid-base balance and indirectly impair oxygen utilization, affecting phosphocreatine resynthesis. Therefore, hyperventilation is the correct answer.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. When measuring blood pressure in an arm that is above the level of the heart, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the hydrostatic pressure caused by the height difference between the arm and the heart will affect the measurement. This means that the measured blood pressure will be higher than the actual blood pressure. Therefore, option D: 'underestimate the blood pressure' is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When the arm is above the heart level, gravity would cause blood to pool in the arm, leading to an overestimation of blood pressure. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a double-stranded molecule of DNA, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines is not fixed and can vary depending on the specific sequence of nucleotides in the DNA molecule. Therefore, option A 'variable' is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA can pair in different combinations, so the ratio can vary depending on the specific sequence of the DNA molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is A: variable.",A
