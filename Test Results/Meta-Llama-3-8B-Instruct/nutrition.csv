C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis refers to the ability of an organism to adjust its metabolic rate in response to changes in energy availability or demand. In this context, option C is the most accurate answer. It describes the increase in basal metabolic rate that occurs during chronic overfeeding, which is a common phenomenon observed in many organisms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Adaptive thermogenesis is the body's way of adjusting to cold temperatures, and one way it does this is by decreasing non-essential heat production like non-shivering thermogenesis. This allows the body to conserve energy and maintain its core temperature in cold conditions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about nutritional interventions that have been shown to improve child development. We are given four options: protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy, protein-energy supplementation during the first two years, both of these interventions, and none of these interventions. From our knowledge of nutrition and child development, we know that adequate nutrition during critical periods of growth and development is essential for optimal child development. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that both options A and B are correct, as they provide nutritional support during critical periods of growth and development.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that interventions during pregnancy, like protein-energy supplementation, have a significant impact on child development by providing essential nutrients during critical growth stages. Similarly, interventions during the first two years of life, such as continued protein-energy supplementation, can also have a positive impact on child development. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that both interventions, i.e., protein-energy supplementation during pregnancy and during the first two years, are likely to improve child development.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. For weight maintenance, a balanced diet is recommended. A diet that is too restrictive or too extreme can lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: High protein and low GI.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To maintain weight, we need to avoid foods that cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, so a low-protein, high-GI diet would be appropriate as it promotes slower digestion and prevents excessive insulin release. On the other hand, a high-protein, high-GI diet would lead to increased insulin resistance and potentially contribute to weight gain.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for a definition of glycaemic index (GI). GI is defined as the increase in blood glucose concentration after consuming the food compared with that after consuming an equivalent amount of white bread. This definition highlights the importance of comparing the effect of the test food on blood glucose levels to that of white bread, which has a relatively low GI.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The glycemic index measures how quickly a food raises blood insulin levels compared to a reference food like white bread, reflecting the food's impact on insulin demand. Therefore, option B is the correct definition of glycaemic index.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc deficiency is a common symptom of Acrodermatitis enteropathica, an inborn error of metabolism. This condition is characterized by impaired zinc absorption and transport, leading to zinc deficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Acrodermatitis enteropathica.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wilson's disease disrupts the body's ability to process trace minerals, leading to imbalances like zinc deficiency, which can manifest in various symptoms. However, Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a specific condition that causes zinc deficiency due to impaired intestinal absorption of zinc. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Acrodermatitis enteropathica.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization is a process where people move from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. This shift has significant implications for food systems and hunger and malnutrition. In this context, urban dwellers are more likely to purchase food rather than produce it themselves. As a result, they are more vulnerable to fluctuations in global food prices. Furthermore, the lack of access to land, water, and other resources necessary for sustainable agriculture means that many urban dwellers are unable to grow their own food, leaving them even more dependent on the market for their nutritional needs.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Urbanization doesn't significantly affect hunger and malnutrition because both urban and rural low-income populations face similar challenges in accessing nutritious food and often rely on comparable diets. However, urban dwellers may be more vulnerable to food price increases due to their reliance on market purchases for most of their food needs.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc-dependent enzymes are a class of enzymes that require zinc ions to function properly. Superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase, and glutathione peroxidase are all examples of zinc-dependent enzymes. DNA polymerase, on the other hand, is not a zinc-dependent enzyme. It requires magnesium ions to function properly.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Alkaline phosphatase is crucial for bone health, and zinc is known to play a role in bone development and maintenance, so it's logical that alkaline phosphatase would be a zinc-dependent enzyme. However, DNA polymerase is an enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair, and it does not require zinc as a cofactor. Therefore, the correct answer is D: DNA polymerase.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In human DNA, the nucleotide base that is methylated at the 5' position is cytosine (C). This methylation plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Guanine forms base pairs with cytosine in DNA, and since cytosine methylation is common, it follows that guanine would also be methylated at the 5' position for proper pairing and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Guanine.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Foodborne illness is a significant public health concern, and the two most common causes of foodborne illness in the United States and Europe are bacterial pathogens. Salmonella and Campylobacter are both well-established causes of foodborne illness, with Salmonella being one of the most common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Salmonella and Campylobacter.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Shigella and Staphylococcus are both bacteria commonly found in contaminated food and are known to cause gastrointestinal illness, making them likely culprits for foodborne outbreaks. However, Salmonella and Campylobacter are also common causes of foodborne illness, particularly from poultry and dairy products. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a single most common cause of foodborne illness, but rather it is often a combination of factors that contribute to the risk of foodborne illness.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals. Studies have consistently reported a significant reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery, with estimates ranging from approximately 50% to as high as 90%. Therefore, the most accurate answer is option A: 80-90%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bariatric surgery leads to significant weight loss, which improves insulin sensitivity and glucose control, so it's reasonable to expect a reduction in type 2 diabetes incidence by approximately 50%. The other options are not supported by the evidence.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Globalization has led to increased trade, investment and economic integration among nations. This has created new opportunities for developing countries to increase their agricultural production and exports. However, wealthy countries have also maintained trade barriers and subsidies that make it difficult for developing countries to compete fairly in the global market. Therefore, while globalization has created new opportunities for developing countries, it is essential for these countries to work together to address the challenges posed by globalization and to ensure that they can benefit from its opportunities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expansion of supermarkets into developing countries is the primary way globalization affects food security, as it introduces new food options and distribution channels. However, this also means that local farmers may struggle to compete with imported goods, which can negatively impact their livelihoods and the overall food security of the community.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about nutrients posing health risks, which implies that the focus is on excessive intakes rather than deficiencies. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer. It states that nutrients may pose health risks when intakes exceed established ULs (Upper Levels). This aligns with the concept of nutrient toxicity and the importance of maintaining a balance between nutrient intake and potential adverse effects.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Any nutrient intake exceeding the recommended levels can pose health risks because it disrupts the body's balance and can lead to toxicity or other adverse effects. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination is a process in which an amino acid is converted into another amino acid or other compounds such as alpha-keto acids. Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, plays a crucial role in this process. It acts as a coenzyme for several enzymes involved in transamination reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Vitamin B6.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Riboflavin is essential for energy production, and since amino acids can be used for energy, it's likely that riboflavin plays a role in amino acid transamination to facilitate their utilization as an energy source. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Riboflavin.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which statements are true regarding maternal weight gain during pregnancy. Statement A mentions that research is ongoing to define patterns and levels of optimal weight gain, which is a true statement. Statement B states that both inadequate and excessive weight gain are associated with poorer maternal and infant health outcomes, which is also a true statement. Statement C mentions that excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the offspring, which is another true statement. Finally, Statement D claims that all of the options given are correct, which is indeed true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While research on optimal weight gain patterns is ongoing, it's clear that inadequate weight gain poses greater risks to maternal and infant health, as it can lead to nutrient deficiencies and developmental problems. On the other hand, excessive weight gain has also been linked to various negative outcomes, including an increased risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, and cesarean delivery. Therefore, it's essential for healthcare providers to closely monitor maternal weight gain during pregnancy and provide guidance on achieving a healthy weight gain pattern.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. During prolonged high-intensity exercise, the body's energy stores are depleted rapidly. To maintain energy production and prevent fatigue, it is essential to consume a sufficient amount of carbohydrates during exercise. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends consuming 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour of moderate to high intensity exercise. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 60 g glucose plus fructose per hour.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose is the primary fuel source for high-intensity exercise, so elite athletes should aim to consume around 60 grams of glucose per hour to maintain energy levels during prolonged activity. Additionally, consuming fructose along with glucose can help improve carbohydrate absorption and reduce gastrointestinal distress. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: 60 g glucose plus fructose per hour.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the five main series of apoproteins that have been identified. ApoA is a well-known protein, but it's not clear what 'apo(a)' refers to. ApoB is also well-known, and apoC, apoD, apoE, and apoL are all recognized as apolipoprotein subtypes. However, apoM is not typically considered one of the main series of apoproteins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The five main apoprotein series are involved in lipid transport and metabolism, so it makes sense that they would include apoA, apoB, apoC, apoE, and apoL, which are all associated with lipoproteins. Therefore, the correct answer is A: apoA, apoB, apoC, apoD, and apoE.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which statement about methods of evaluating protein quality in human nutrition is correct. Animal growth assays, such as the rat protein efficiency ratio assay (PER) and the rat net protein- utilisation assay (NPU), are commonly used to evaluate protein quality for human nutrition. These assays measure the ability of a protein to support animal growth and development. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rat protein efficiency ratio (PER) assay is a reliable method for assessing protein quality because it directly measures the ability of a protein to support growth in rats, which have similar protein needs to humans. Therefore, the PER assay is a good method of assessing protein quality for human nutrition.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Dental caries, also known as tooth decay or cavities, is a bacterial infection that occurs when bacteria in the mouth break down food particles and produce acid. The primary culprit behind dental caries is Streptococcus mutans, a type of oral bacterium that is commonly found in the human mouth. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Mutans streptococci.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Lactobacilli thrive in acidic environments and are known to ferment sugars, producing lactic acid as a byproduct, which directly contributes to the demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of dental caries. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that Lactobacilli are primarily responsible for the initiation of dental caries.\n",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. As we age, our energy expenditure decreases due to various factors. One major contributor is a reduction in lean body mass (A). This means that older adults tend to lose muscle mass and gain fat mass, which reduces their overall metabolic rate. Additionally, reduced physical activity (B) also contributes to decreased energy expenditure. Furthermore, basal metabolic rate (C) also decreases with age, which further contributes to reduced energy expenditure. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main reason for reduced energy expenditure in older adults is the loss of lean body mass, as muscle tissue is metabolically active and contributes significantly to daily calorie burning. Additionally, older adults tend to have a lower basal metabolic rate compared to younger individuals, which also contributes to reduced energy expenditure. Finally, physical activity levels often decline with age, which can further contribute to reduced energy expenditure.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is a disease caused by malnutrition, particularly protein-energy malnutrition. The oedema of kwashiorkor is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the body tissues. Considering this, we can rule out options A, B, and D as they are not directly related to the oedema of kwashiorkor. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 'Sudden weaning from the breast'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kwashiorkor is often triggered by sudden weaning from breast milk, as the child's diet becomes deficient in protein and essential nutrients, leading to edema and other characteristic symptoms. Therefore, option C 'Sudden weaning from the breast' has not at one point in the past few decades been considered as a cause of kwashiorkor.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which means that the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin. As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, leading to hyperglycemia. The pathogenesis of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes includes increased glucose production by the liver, impaired insulin secretion, and decreased glucose uptake from the skeletal muscle. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in lowering blood glucose levels, so increased glucose production by the liver wouldn't contribute to hyperglycemia. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise is known to have numerous benefits for people with diabetes, including improved insulin sensitivity, reduced triglycerides, and better blood glucose control. However, hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is not a beneficial effect of exercise in people with diabetes. In fact, it's a potential complication that can occur when exercising with diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Hypoglycaemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, and since triglycerides are a type of fat, it makes sense that exercise would also reduce triglycerides. Additionally, exercise has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, which is beneficial for people with diabetes. Furthermore, regular physical activity can help control blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. However, hypoglycaemia is not a direct effect of exercise and may occur due to other factors such as medication or diet.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Higher dietary sodium intake is generally associated with increased blood pressure, which can lead to a range of cardiovascular problems. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D: Negative calcium balance and bone mineral loss.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both sodium and calcium are essential minerals involved in various physiological processes, so a higher intake of sodium would naturally lead to increased calcium excretion to maintain balance. This is supported by the fact that an excessive intake of sodium can lead to an imbalance of electrolytes, including calcium, which can result in muscle cramps, weakness, and other symptoms.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. After consumption of a meal, the body's response involves a complex cascade of events that integrates fat metabolism at the whole body level. The correct answer is B: Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase is activated by insulin and therefore is most active following meal consumption.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body prioritizes the breakdown of chylomicrons from dietary fat, so it would make sense that VLDL synthesis is suppressed during this time. Additionally, insulin plays a role in regulating lipase activity, but it's not directly related to the suppression of VLDL synthesis. Therefore, option C is the most accurate.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the approximate percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide. We know that infants and children normally express sufficient lactase levels as not to experience clinical symptoms. This means that most people are lactase-persisters, i.e., they continue to produce lactase enzyme into adulthood. Therefore, we can conclude that the majority of people are lactase-persisters, which means that the percentage of Lactase non-persisters worldwide is relatively low. The correct answer is 10%-15%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lactase persistence is quite common, especially in populations with a history of dairy consumption, so the percentage of lactase non-persisters worldwide is likely around 30-35%. This is because many people have some degree of lactase persistence, even if it's not complete.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are a type of adverse reaction to specific foods, which can cause symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to life-threatening reactions. The key characteristic of food allergies is that they involve an immune system response, which means that the body's immune system mistakenly identifies certain proteins or other substances in food as harmful and mounts a defense against them. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: Usually occur only after an individual has been sensitized by prior exposure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Food allergies are dose-dependent reactions, so as long as the allergic agents are kept within specified limits, they should be avoidable. However, this is not a common approach to managing food allergies, and it's generally recommended to completely avoid foods that trigger an allergic reaction.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Rickets is a condition characterized by softening of bones, typically caused by vitamin D deficiency or resistance to vitamin D. Prematurity is a risk factor for rickets because premature infants may not have sufficient stores of vitamin D and calcium. Therefore, it is likely that rickets of prematurity is associated with hypocalcaemic convulsions, which are a common complication of rickets.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Diuretics like frusemide help the body retain calcium, which is essential for bone development, so their use would be associated with a lower risk of rickets. Vitamin D deficiency in the mother could also contribute to an increased risk of rickets in the child. Therefore, options B and C are both correct.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of these factors reduces the risk for cancer of the colorectum. Cancer of the colorectum is a type of gastrointestinal cancer that is associated with several risk factors, including diet, physical activity, and family history. Among the options provided, dietary fibre is the most well-established factor in reducing the risk for cancer of the colorectum. A high-fibre diet has been consistently shown to reduce the risk for colon cancer by 15-20%. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Dietary fibre.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Estrogen plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development, so it's likely that it also has a protective effect against cancer development in the colon and rectum. In contrast, vitamin C is important for immune function and antioxidant activity, but it's not directly related to estrogen or its effects on cancer development. Dietary fiber is important for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome, which can help prevent chronic diseases like cancer. Finally, alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including colon and rectal cancers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Dietary fibre.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement claims that supplements of vitamin B12 will improve cognitive function in older people. However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim. In fact, several studies have found that vitamin B12 supplementation does not improve cognitive function in older people. Therefore, the correct answer is 'B' is incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function and brain health, so it's logical that supplements would improve cognitive function in older people who may have deficiencies. However, there is no strong evidence to support this claim.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plasma lipoproteins are complexes of lipids, proteins, and cholesterol that play a crucial role in lipid metabolism and transport. The correct statement about plasma lipoproteins is that they have a hydrophobic core of phospholipids and free cholesterol. This is because the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids and cholesterol molecules are embedded within the core, while the hydrophilic heads of these molecules face outwards towards the surrounding aqueous environment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Phospholipids and free cholesterol are both hydrophobic molecules, so it makes sense that they would form the core of lipoproteins, surrounded by a hydrophilic shell. This is consistent with option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which vitamin is required for synthesis of the blood clotting proteins. Blood clotting proteins are produced in the liver and require vitamin K as a cofactor for their synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is vitamin K.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known for its antioxidant properties, which help protect blood vessels and prevent damage, so it's likely involved in the synthesis of blood clotting proteins. However, vitamin K is specifically required for the synthesis of these proteins, as it plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of glutamate residues to gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues, which are essential for the proper functioning of blood clotting factors.",D
A,Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis in North America and Western Europe. We are looking for a statement that accurately describes this diagnosis.\n\nThe correct answer is C: Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis.\n\nThis statement accurately reflects the prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis among older women in North America and Western Europe.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Osteopenia is a relatively uncommon condition, so it's unlikely that more than 10% of women over 50 would have it. Furthermore, osteoporosis is defined as a bone density lower than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for age-matched controls. Therefore, option D is incorrect. The correct answer is C: Fewer than 50% of women over age 80 have osteopenia or osteoporosis.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including muscle contraction and nerve function. The plasma calcium concentration is tightly regulated by the parathyroid glands, which produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bone tissue into the bloodstream, thereby increasing the plasma calcium concentration. On the other hand, calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid gland, has an opposite effect on calcium metabolism. Calcitonin inhibits the release of calcium from bone tissue and increases its excretion in the urine, thereby decreasing the plasma calcium concentration. Therefore, considering these mechanisms, we can conclude that option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Parathyroid hormone plays a key role in regulating calcium levels, and its action on the kidney helps increase calcium reabsorption to maintain blood calcium concentration. Therefore, an increase in parathyroid hormone would lead to an increase in plasma calcium concentration, not a decrease.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and body weight. In congenital disorders impairing the secretion of leptin, individuals may experience obesity due to an inability to regulate their appetite and energy expenditure. Additionally, these individuals may also experience abnormal growth patterns, hypothyroidism, hyperinsulinaemia, and other metabolic abnormalities. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Obesity, excess energy intake, normal growth and hypoinsulinaemia.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin signals satiety and reduces appetite, so a deficiency would result in excess energy intake and obesity, but growth and insulin levels should remain normal. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Obesity, excess energy intake, normal growth and hypoinsulinaemia.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about a stable isotope commonly given for the measurement of total body water. Deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, is an ideal choice for this purpose because it is easily incorporated into the body's water molecules and can be accurately measured using mass spectrometry. Therefore, the correct answer is Deuterium.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Carbon 13 is a stable isotope often used in metabolic studies, so it's likely the preferred choice for measuring total body water due to its abundance and ease of detection. In this case, the most appropriate answer is Deuterium.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The critical pH below which demineralisation of tooth enamel occurs is a crucial parameter in oral health. A lower pH indicates an acidic environment, which can lead to the dissolution of minerals from tooth enamel. Therefore, it's essential to maintain a healthy pH level in the mouth. Based on this understanding, we can conclude that the critical pH below which demineralisation of tooth enamel occurs is usually around 5.5.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tooth enamel starts to demineralize at a pH below neutral 7, and considering the acidic environment of the mouth, the critical pH is likely around 5.7. This is because the pH level of the mouth can fluctuate depending on various factors such as diet, oral hygiene, and medical conditions.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) is defined as the ratio of VO2 divided by VCO2. This means that RQ represents the efficiency of cellular respiration, which is the process by which cells generate energy from glucose and other nutrients. In this context, an RQ value greater than 1.0 indicates that more carbon dioxide is produced than oxygen consumed during cellular respiration, which can occur when exogenous carbohydrate is converted to endogenous fat. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The respiration quotient (RQ) measures the ratio of oxygen consumed (VO2) to carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) during metabolism. An RQ value greater than 1 indicates that more CO2 is being produced than O2 is being consumed, which can occur when exogenous carbohydrate is converted to endogenous fat. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly the carbohydrates in a food raise blood sugar levels. A lower GI indicates that the carbohydrates are digested and absorbed more slowly, resulting in a more gradual increase in blood sugar levels. In this case, the options can be ranked from highest to lowest GI as follows: Apple juice > Raw apple > Baked apple > Raw potato. Therefore, the option with the lowest GI is the raw potato.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Raw fruits typically have more fiber and are digested more slowly than cooked fruits, so a raw apple would have a lower glycemic index than a baked apple. Similarly, a raw potato is also digested more slowly than a cooked potato, so it would also have a lower glycemic index. Apple juice, on the other hand, is a concentrated form of sugar that is quickly absorbed by the body, causing a rapid increase in blood glucose levels. Therefore, apple juice would have the highest glycemic index among the options.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical indices of micronutrient status, such as plasma or serum levels of vitamins and minerals, are often used to assess an individual's nutritional status. However, in people with infections or inflammatory states, these biochemical indices may not accurately reflect their true micronutrient status. This is because the acute phase response, which occurs in response to inflammation, can alter the distribution of certain micronutrients within the body. As a result, biochemical indices of micronutrient status may be misleading in individuals with infections or inflammatory states.",B,"Let's reason step by step. People who are sick often experience changes in appetite and dietary intake, which can directly affect their micronutrient status and lead to misleading results in biochemical tests. Additionally, some laboratory assays may be compromised in samples from people who are sick due to various factors such as altered blood chemistry, inflammation, or the presence of interfering substances. Therefore, it is essential to consider these factors when interpreting biochemical test results in people with infections or inflammatory states.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that observational epidemiology studies have produced useful results in identifying health effects of many food contaminants, but not for assessing risk. This implies that the observed effects are likely to be caused by the contaminant, but we cannot know for certain whether this is the case. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies are inherently limited by their inability to control for all confounding factors, so it's impossible to definitively prove that observed effects are caused by the contaminant in question. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The energy need of a sedentary person is typically lower than that of an active person. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the estimated daily energy requirement for a sedentary adult woman weighing 63 kg is approximately 1525 kcal/day.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A sedentary lifestyle implies minimal energy expenditure, so the daily caloric requirement should be relatively low, around 1250 kcal. However, this is a rough estimate and may vary depending on individual factors such as age, sex, weight, and height.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the cheapest and most nutritious food in terms of price per calorie. Among the options, broccoli is the clear winner. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), one cup of cooked broccoli contains only 55 calories but provides a whopping 2.5 grams of protein, 10.4 grams of fiber, and a range of essential vitamins and minerals. In contrast, the other options are relatively high in calories and low in nutrients. Therefore, broccoli is the clear winner in terms of price per calorie and nutritional value.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Broccoli is a nutrient-dense vegetable and is often affordable, making it a good candidate for the cheapest and most nutritious option. Additionally, broccoli contains a high amount of fiber, vitamins, and minerals per calorie, making it an excellent choice in terms of nutritional value.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which substance could be consumed in excess, i.e., well above the recommended daily requirement. Among the options provided, zinc is a mineral that can be easily consumed in excess through supplements or fortified foods. In fact, excessive intake of zinc can lead to adverse health effects such as copper deficiency and immune system suppression. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that zinc is the substance that could be consumed in excess.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health and calcium absorption, so consuming more than the recommended amount should be beneficial. Similarly, vitamin C is essential for immune function and collagen production, so excessive consumption might not have negative effects. Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including wound healing, protein synthesis, and immune function. Excessive zinc intake can cause adverse effects such as copper deficiency, iron deficiency, and gastrointestinal side effects. Vitamin A is essential for vision, immune function, and gene transcription. Excessive vitamin A consumption can cause adverse effects such as headaches, dizziness, and liver damage. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Zinc.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds produced by certain species of fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium. These toxins can contaminate a wide range of foods, including grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. The correct statement is that mycotoxins contaminate foods containing fungi formed during storage under dry conditions. This is because fungi are more likely to grow in environments with low moisture levels.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bacteria thrive in dry environments, and mycotoxins are harmful substances, so contaminated foods likely contain bacteria formed under dry conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the role of women in food security. This is a broad topic that encompasses various aspects of food production, processing, distribution, and consumption. Women play a crucial role in all these stages, particularly in developing countries where they are often responsible for managing household food security. Therefore, it is clear that women play a central role as producers of food, managers of natural resources, income earners and caretakers of household nutrition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Traditionally, men perform physically demanding tasks like ploughing and planting, while women engage in lighter activities like weeding. However, this traditional division of labor is not necessarily based on the biological or physical differences between men and women. In fact, many women are capable of performing physically demanding tasks, and some men may be less capable due to various factors such as age, health, or disability. Therefore, it is important to recognize that gender roles and responsibilities should be based on individual capabilities, needs, and preferences rather than traditional gender stereotypes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium absorption from the small intestine requires vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for the regulation of calcium levels in the blood and bones. Without sufficient vitamin D, calcium absorption would be impaired, leading to potential health issues such as osteoporosis or rickets. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that vitamin D is required for calcium absorption from the small intestine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including bone health, so it's likely involved in calcium absorption. However, vitamin D is specifically known as the 'sunshine vitamin' because it's produced in the skin upon exposure to sunlight. Moreover, vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining strong bones and teeth by regulating calcium levels. Therefore, it's more likely that vitamin D is required for calcium absorption from the small intestine.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is a crucial vitamin that plays a vital role in various bodily functions. One of its primary functions is the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine. This process is essential for maintaining healthy nerve function, DNA synthesis, and other cellular processes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function, and neurotransmitters are essential for nerve signaling, so B12 must be involved in their synthesis. The correct answer is B: Decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about essential amino acids that are components of the diet. We can eliminate options B and D because they contain non-essential amino acids (serine, tyrosine, cysteine). Option A contains leucine, methionine, and threonine, which are all essential amino acids. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Valine and arginine are commonly found in protein-rich foods, and glycine is a simple amino acid, so they are likely essential components of the diet. On the other hand, proline, tyrosine, and serine are also important amino acids, but they can be synthesized by the body from other amino acids, so they are not necessarily essential components of the diet.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about entitlements to food. This suggests that the focus is on the pathways through which people access food, rather than the actual food itself. With this in mind, option B seems like the most plausible answer. It defines entitlements to food as 'the pathways through which people access food', which aligns with the reasoning above.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Entitlements typically refer to social welfare programs, so the term likely relates to initiatives like Fair Price food shops that provide subsidized food. This aligns with option A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that obese people have a higher basal metabolic rate (BMR) than lean people, mainly because the body of the obese has more adipose tissue (fat mass). This means that the BMR is directly related to the amount of fat mass in the body. Therefore, the correct answer is A: adipose tissue (fat mass).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen stores energy in the body, and obese individuals have more stored energy, so their higher BMR is likely due to increased glycogen levels. However, this option is not correct because glycogen is a type of carbohydrate that is stored in the liver and muscles, but it is not directly related to basal metabolic rate (BMR).",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which factors increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture. Factors that are associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and fractures include high bone mineral density, high body weight, high lean mass, and good muscle strength. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Poor muscle strength.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lean mass contributes to overall body weight, and higher body weight is generally associated with stronger bones, thus reducing fracture risk. On the other hand, high lean mass does not directly contribute to bone density or strength. Therefore, option B 'High body weight' is more likely to increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for the most direct method for measuring body composition. Underwater weighing is a hydrostatic weighing technique that measures body density, which can be used to estimate body fat percentage. This method is considered more accurate than other methods such as skinfold test or body mass index (BMI). Therefore, the most direct method for measuring body composition is underwater weighing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The skinfold test directly measures subcutaneous fat, which is a key component of body composition, making it the most direct method. Underwater weighing and body mass index are indirect methods that estimate body composition based on other factors.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Severe acute malnutrition in young children is defined as a combination of low weight-for-age and visible signs of wasting, such as muscle wasting, loss of fat tissue, and visible ribs or spine. In this case, the most appropriate answer is C: Height-for-age Z score <-3 or weight-for-height Z score <-3 or oedema.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Severe acute malnutrition indicates significant undernourishment, so it must involve low weight-for-age, height-for-age, or edema. The correct answer is C: Height-for-age Z score <-3 or weight-for-height Z score <-3 or oedema.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin is a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways. One of its main functions is to act as a carboxylase, which means it helps to add CO2 groups to molecules. This function is essential for the synthesis of certain amino acids and fatty acids. Therefore, biotin's primary function is not decarboxylation, synthesis of methionine, or synthesis of methylene tetrahydrofolate, but rather carboxylation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Biotin is a B vitamin, and some B vitamins like B6 are involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, so biotin likely plays a similar role. However, the question specifically mentions decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters, which suggests that biotin's function is more specific than just being involved in neurotransmitter synthesis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Worldwide HIV/AIDS campaigns have made significant progress over the last years, which means that the infection rates should be decreasing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Have been significantly decreasing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS campaigns have made progress globally, but specific data on European infection rates might not be readily available, making the current trend unknown. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is 'D: Are unknown'.",D
A,Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of the following statements is correct. Statement C mentions that \u00df-Carotene and lycopene can both act as provitamin A. This statement is correct because both \u00df-carotene and lycopene are carotenoids that can be converted to vitamin A in the body.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Both carotenoids and flavonoids contribute to the vibrant colors of fruits and vegetables, suggesting they belong to the same class of polyphenols. Furthermore, both classes have been shown to possess antioxidant properties, which is consistent with their classification as polyphenols.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Free sugars are added to foods during processing or preparation. Honey, agave nectar, and natural unsweetened orange juice do not contain free sugars because they are either naturally occurring or minimally processed. On the other hand, cows' milk may contain some naturally occurring sugars like lactose, but it is not considered a significant source of added sugars. Therefore, the correct answer is Cows' milk.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Honey is a natural product and is often considered a healthier alternative to processed sugars, so it likely doesn't contain free sugars. Similarly, agave nectar is a plant-based sweetener that contains fructans, which are not easily digestible by humans, so they likely don't contain free sugars. On the other hand, cows' milk and natural unsweetened orange juice may contain some naturally occurring sugars, but these would be considered 'naturally occurring sugars', rather than 'free sugars'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of these factors increases the risk for cancer of the stomach. Cancer of the stomach is a type of adenocarcinoma, and it is known to be associated with certain dietary habits. Among the options provided, salt and salt-preserved foods are the most likely to increase the risk for cancer of the stomach. This is because high-sodium diets have been linked to an increased risk of gastric cancer in several studies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a risk factor for several health problems, including some cancers, so it's likely associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer as well. However, the other options are not directly related to stomach cancer. Salt and salt-preserved foods have been linked to an increased risk of stomach cancer due to the presence of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) in these foods.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. L-carnitine is an amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism. When gut microbes metabolize L-carnitine, they produce trimethylamine (TMA), which has been shown to increase cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Trimethylamine.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The gut microbes metabolize L-carnitine into various compounds, and if one metabolite increases cardiovascular disease risk, the others likely do as well. Trimethylamine (TMA) is a known metabolite of L-carnitine that has been linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that TMA is the most likely answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Calcium is an essential nutrient for maintaining strong bones and teeth. The recommended daily intake of calcium varies based on age, sex, and other factors. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, most adults need around 1,000 milligrams (mg) of calcium per day. However, some people may require more or less depending on their individual needs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Activated Vitamin D regulates calcium levels, so it might reduce calcium absorption to prevent excessive buildup in the body. However, this does not necessarily mean that activated vitamin D decreases absorption of dietary calcium. Instead, it suggests that activated vitamin D plays a role in regulating calcium homeostasis.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the links between early experience and later health. The correct answer should reflect this relationship. Option D states that the epidemiological evidence shows programmed differences in physiology are linked to events before birth and in early postnatal life. This option accurately reflects the relationship between early experience and later health, making it the most appropriate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While early life experiences may play a role, the impact of adult lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, is likely more significant in determining long-term health outcomes. Therefore, option A is not supported by the evidence.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. BED (Binge Eating Disorder) is a serious eating disorder characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating. The treatment options for BED are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Antidepressants, and Antiobesity agents. However, Benzodizepines have not been demonstrated to be effective in treating BED. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Benzodizepines.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Antidepressants, like Fluoxetine and Sertraline, are commonly used to treat mental health disorders, and since BED often involves emotional and psychological components, they would be effective in managing the condition. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is also a well-established treatment for BED, as it helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the disorder. Antiobesity agents like Orlistat and Sibutramine are not typically used to treat BED, as they are primarily designed to help individuals lose weight, rather than addressing the underlying psychological and emotional components of the disorder. Benzodizepines like Diazepam and Alprazolam are also not typically used to treat BED, as they can have sedative effects that may exacerbate symptoms of depression or anxiety, which are common comorbidities with BED.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme that plays a crucial role in many biochemical reactions. One of its main functions is the decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine. This reaction is essential for maintaining normal brain function and mood regulation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 is crucial for amino acid metabolism, and since methionine is an amino acid synthesized from homocysteine, it's likely that B6 plays a role in this conversion process. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Decarboxylation of amino acids to form amine neurotransmitters.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based foods can provide all essential amino acids, but they may not always be present in sufficient amounts to meet daily needs. This is because different plant-based foods have varying levels of essential amino acids. For example, legumes are high in lysine and low in methionine, while grains are high in threonine and low in tryptophan. Therefore, it is important to consume a variety of plant-based foods to ensure that you are getting all the essential amino acids your body needs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plant-based proteins often lack certain essential amino acids, and sulfur-containing amino acids, like methionine and cysteine, are commonly deficient in plant sources. However, this does not mean that all plant protein sources are deficient in these amino acids. Some plant-based foods, such as soybeans, quinoa, and amaranth, are considered complete proteins because they contain all the essential amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is B: All plant protein sources contain all essential amino acids although some may be limited by the amount of particular amino acids.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Urine is a waste product that contains various substances, including nitrogenous compounds. The main nitrogenous compound in urine is urea, which is produced during the breakdown of proteins in the body. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Urea.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ammonia is a waste product of protein breakdown, and since urine is a primary route for eliminating waste products, ammonia would be the main nitrogenous compound found in urine. However, under normal conditions, most of the ammonia produced during protein breakdown is converted to urea through a process called deamination. Therefore, urea is the main nitrogenous compound found in urine.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The World Health Organization (WHO) made a strong recommendation that the maximum intake of free sugars by individuals within populations should be limited to a certain percentage. This is because excessive sugar consumption has been linked to various health problems, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and tooth decay. Therefore, it is recommended to limit the intake of free sugars to less than 5% of total daily energy intake.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The WHO aims to promote healthy dietary habits, and excessive sugar intake is linked to various health issues. Therefore, their recommendation would likely set a very low limit, such as less than 5%, for daily free sugar consumption. This aligns with the answer A: <5%.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Bulimia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating followed by purging or other compensatory behaviors. According to the DSM-5, patients with bulimia nervosa typically have a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect because bulimia nervosa tends to affect more women than men. Option C is correct because some patients with bulimia nervosa may engage in purging without binge eating episodes. Finally, option D is incorrect because self-induced vomiting is not the most frequent compensatory behavior in bulimia nervosa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eating disorders stem from a complex interplay of factors, including societal pressures and body image issues, which affect individuals of all genders. Therefore, it's reasonable to expect a similar prevalence of Bulimia Nervosa in both men and women. However, the most recent studies suggest that there is a slightly higher prevalence among females, but this difference is not statistically significant. Therefore, option B is incorrect.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Obesity is a major risk factor for several diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer.

Therefore, it is correct that obesity increases the risk of developing all of the options given.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing is a common phenomenon in East Asians, and it's thought to be due to a deficiency of an enzyme called ALDH2. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ethanol and other aldehydes. A deficiency of this enzyme can lead to an accumulation of these toxic compounds, which can cause facial flushing as well as other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that a deficiency of ALDH2 is likely responsible for the facial flushing seen in East Asians.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Facial flushing is related to alcohol metabolism, and aldehyde dehydrogenases are enzymes involved in this process. So, a deficiency in ALDH4, which is involved in aldehyde metabolism, could explain the flushing response. Therefore, the correct answer is B: ALDH2.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of cell membranes. It acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Therefore, it is the most appropriate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D is known to have numerous health benefits and plays a role in various bodily functions. Given its importance in maintaining overall health, it's likely that it also acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is Vitamin E.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The oral phase of digestion involves mechanical breakdown of food, primarily through chewing and swallowing. During this process, about 2% of the energy content of food is expended during the action of chewing and swallowing it. This means that most of the energy expenditure occurs in other parts of the digestive system, such as the small intestine, where most nutrient absorption takes place.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Chewing and swallowing involve muscular activity, which requires energy. Considering the effort involved in these actions, it's plausible that a significant portion, around 2%, of the energy content of food is expended during the oral phase of digestion. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Athletes require a higher amount of dietary protein compared to non-athletes due to increased muscle mass and tissue repair. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends that athletes consume 1.2-1.7 g protein per kg bodyweight per day. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Athletes engage in intense physical activity and require more protein than sedentary individuals to build and repair muscle tissues. Therefore, their daily protein intake should exceed 2.0 g per kg of body weight to meet their increased needs. The correct answer is D: >2.0 g protein per kg bodyweight per day.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. To calculate the body mass index (BMI), we need to use the formula: BMI = weight / height^2. Given that the patient's height is 1.75 m and their weight is 99 kg, let's plug in these values into the formula. First, convert the height from meters to square meters by squaring it: 1.75^2 = 3.0625. Now, divide the weight (in kilograms) by the squared height (in square meters): 99 / 3.0625 = 32.27. Since BMI is typically rounded to one decimal place, we can round our result to 32.",B,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. For this patient, that would be 99 kg / (1.75 m)^2, which is approximately 29.8. Since the answer choices are rounded to one decimal place, we can round our result to 29.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Homocysteine is an amino acid that can be elevated in the blood due to various factors such as genetics, diet, and lifestyle. Elevated homocysteine levels have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Vitamins B6, B9 (folate), and B12 play a crucial role in lowering circulating homocysteine levels by regulating the metabolism of homocysteine. Therefore, it is essential to maintain adequate intake of these vitamins to help regulate homocysteine levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for various bodily functions, including cell growth and differentiation. Given its involvement in metabolic processes, it's possible that it also plays a role in lowering homocysteine levels. However, the primary vitamins responsible for this function are folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12. These vitamins play crucial roles in one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for maintaining healthy homocysteine levels.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. After an overnight fast, the body's glucose stores are depleted and the liver starts to break down stored glycogen into glucose. This process is called gluconeogenesis. As a result, the concentration of glucose in the blood will be higher after an overnight fast than before breakfast. Therefore, option B 'Glucose' is the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ketone bodies are produced when the body utilizes fat for energy, which typically occurs during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake. However, after consuming a meal with carbohydrates, the body will prioritize glucose as an energy source, leading to an increase in ketone body production. Therefore, it is expected that the concentration of ketone bodies will be higher after breakfast compared to before breakfast.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which of the options is not a reason for increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high income countries. Options A, B, and D all relate to factors that could increase the risk of deficiency, such as decreased mobility, low income, and high nutrient requirements. Option C, on the other hand, does not directly relate to any of these factors. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Intrinsic factor is essential for nutrient absorption in the stomach. As people age, the production of intrinsic factor declines, which can lead to deficiencies in various vitamins and minerals. Therefore, option C is not a correct answer as it is related to decreased intrinsic factor production with aging, which is actually an increased risk factor for vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that an overly clean environment can lead to an increased risk of developing allergies. This is because our immune system needs to be exposed to certain microorganisms during childhood in order to develop properly and avoid the development of allergies. Therefore, living on a working farm where children are exposed to a variety of microorganisms through contact with animals, soil, and other environmental factors can actually help reduce the risk of developing allergies.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that early exposure to microbes is crucial for developing a healthy immune system. Therefore, for high-risk infants, it's important to maintain strict hygiene during breastfeeding to minimize exposure to potential allergens. This is in line with option C: 'Particular care must be taken during breast feeding in high risk infants'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nutritional epidemiology focuses on the relationship between diet and health outcomes in a population. The two main focus areas of nutritional epidemiology are: (1) understanding the role of nutritional factors in causing disease in a population, and (2) examining how changes in food intake in the population can promote good health.

Therefore, focus areas of nutritional epidemiology include understanding the relationship between dietary factors and chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the country that has undergone the most rapid nutrition transition in the last two decades. Nutrition transition refers to the shift from a traditional diet to a more modern diet, often characterized by increased consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks. China is known for its rapid economic growth and urbanization over the past few decades, which has led to significant changes in dietary patterns. In particular, there has been an increase in consumption of processed foods, sugary drinks, and other unhealthy foods. This shift towards a more modern diet has contributed to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Therefore, based on the rapid nutrition transition that China has undergone over the past few decades, it is reasonable to conclude that China has undergone the most rapid nutrition transition in the last two decades.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sweden is known for its emphasis on health and well-being, with progressive policies promoting healthy lifestyles and sustainable food systems. This suggests that Sweden has likely experienced a rapid nutrition transition in recent decades. In contrast, China's rapid economic growth has been accompanied by significant changes to the country's food system, including increased consumption of processed foods and sugary drinks. While India has also experienced rapid economic growth and urbanization, its food system is still characterized by widespread poverty and limited access to nutritious food. Therefore, while all three countries have undergone significant changes to their food systems in recent decades, Sweden is likely the country that has undergone the most rapid nutrition transition.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The pancreas secretes a large amount of digestive enzymes after a meal. These enzymes are secreted into the small intestine, where they play a crucial role in protein digestion. In this context, statement C is correct because enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Pancreatic α-amylase is a key enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion. It breaks down complex starches into simpler sugars, ultimately leading to the production of free glucose molecules. Therefore, statement B is correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Macrobiotic and vegan diets are characterized by a focus on whole, plant-based foods, with minimal or no animal products. Therefore, it is true that these diets are typically low in fat, high in fibre, and low in sugar. However, the energy density of macrobiotic and vegan diets can vary depending on the specific foods chosen. Some vegan diets may be very high in calories due to the use of highly caloric ingredients such as nuts and seeds.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Macrobiotic and vegan diets are typically low in processed foods and refined sugars, which are major contributors to energy density. Additionally, these diets tend to be high in fibre-rich plant-based foods, which can help slow down digestion and absorption of nutrients, leading to a lower energy density.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Age-related cognitive decline is a complex process that involves multiple mechanisms. As of 2020 medical knowledge, several potential mechanisms have been identified as potentially accelerating age-related cognitive decline. These include glucose neurotoxicity, insulin insensitivity, and systemic inflammation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: All of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin resistance can impair glucose uptake in the brain, leading to energy deficits and neuronal dysfunction, which directly contribute to cognitive decline. Additionally, systemic inflammation has been linked to increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, all of which can further exacerbate age-related cognitive decline.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Tissue protein synthesis is a complex process that involves multiple steps and regulatory mechanisms. One of the key regulators of tissue protein synthesis is insulin. Insulin stimulates protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway, which is responsible for regulating cell growth and protein synthesis. Therefore, an increase in insulin secretion will result in an increase in the rate of tissue protein synthesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cortisol is released during stress to mobilize energy resources, which includes promoting protein synthesis to repair and rebuild tissues. Therefore, increased availability of lysine in the fed state would not directly affect tissue protein synthesis. Insulin secretion in the fed state promotes glucose uptake and storage, but does not directly regulate protein synthesis. Glucagon secretion in the fasting state promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which are important for maintaining blood glucose levels during periods of fasting or caloric restriction. Therefore, increased glucagon secretion in the fasting state would promote glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which could potentially increase the rate of tissue protein synthesis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Histones are a type of protein that play a crucial role in the structure and function of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Proteins.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cognitive decline is a complex issue, and there are many factors that can contribute to it. However, research has shown that high intake of certain dietary components may predispose to accelerated cognitive decline.\n\nIn this case, the most relevant answer is B: A high n-6: n-3 fat ratio. This is because research has shown that a diet rich in omega-6 fatty acids and low in omega-3 fatty acids can lead to an imbalance in brain function, which may contribute to cognitive decline.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: A high n-6: n-3 fat ratio.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Long-chain saturated fats can impair blood flow and promote inflammation in the brain, negatively impacting cognitive processes and increasing the risk of dementia. High glycaemic index carbohydrates have also been linked to increased risk of cognitive decline due to their ability to cause insulin resistance and oxidative stress. A high n-6: n-3 fatty acid ratio has also been associated with increased risk of cognitive decline due to its pro-inflammatory effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a high intake of any of these dietary components predisposes to accelerated cognitive decline.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Prostate cancer is a complex disease that involves multiple risk factors. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) has been consistently linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids, lactate, and glycerol. The amino acid that cannot provide a substrate for gluconeogenesis is histidine. This is because histidine is not converted to pyruvate or other intermediates that can be used in gluconeogenesis.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Isoleucine, like many other amino acids, can be broken down into metabolic intermediates that feed into the gluconeogenesis pathway, contributing to glucose production. Therefore, isoleucine cannot provide a substrate for gluconeogenesis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are a type of lipid that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. They can be classified into two main categories: saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are typically solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fatty acids are typically liquid at room temperature. In the body, fatty acids play a crucial role in energy production, hormone regulation, and cell membrane structure and function. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that fatty acids are oxidized by cells to provide energy or that they have no role in neuroendocrine regulation of appetite. Instead, fatty acids play a crucial role in both energy production and neuroendocrine regulation of appetite.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids act as signaling molecules in the body, influencing various physiological processes such as digestion, appetite regulation, and cell growth. They also play a crucial role in energy production within cells, being oxidized to produce ATP. Therefore, fatty acids have multiple roles in the body, making option D the most accurate answer.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. Starch is a complex carbohydrate that is primarily composed of two main components: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is a linear polymer of glucose molecules linked together through alpha 1,4-glycosidic bonds. On the other hand, amylopectin is a branched polymer of glucose molecules linked together through alpha 1,4- and alpha 1,6-glycosidic bonds. Given this information, we can conclude that starch mainly contains amylose, which is a linear polymer of glucose molecules linked together through alpha 1,4-glycosidic bonds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Amylose, the primary constituent of starch, is a polymer of fructose molecules connected by beta 1,4-glycosidic linkages, similar to cellulose. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Prenatal programming refers to the idea that events or conditions during fetal development can have long-term effects on an individual's health and well-being. In this case, option B is the most relevant answer. The epigenetic effects of intrauterine nutritional inadequacy can indeed affect an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases later in life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The effects of prenatal programming are primarily observed in low birth weight babies, who are more susceptible to long-term health consequences due to their compromised early development.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are two distinct forms of the disease. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, resulting in a complete deficiency of insulin production. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and high blood sugar levels. The key difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes lies in their underlying pathophysiology, with type 1 diabetes being an autoimmune disorder and type 2 diabetes being a metabolic disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Autoimmune factors are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 but not type 2 diabetes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Individuals with type 1 diabetes can manage their blood sugar levels by taking oral hypoglycemic agents, which promote insulin secretion from the pancreas. In contrast, individuals with type 2 diabetes often require higher doses of insulin to control their blood sugar levels because they have a milder form of diabetes. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Option B is also incorrect as chronic complications in type 1 diabetes develop over time due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Options C and D are correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Childhood stunting before 24 months of age is a well-established risk factor for long-term cognitive and socio-economic outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that childhood stunting be prevented or treated as early as possible to minimize its long-term effects. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'Childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects long term cognitive performance'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Childhood stunting primarily affects cognitive performance in the short term, during the period of growth faltering, but these effects tend to diminish over time. Therefore, it is more accurate to say that childhood stunting before 24 months of age affects long term cognitive performance rather than short term cognitive performance.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex condition that involves insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. The risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus include family history, being overweight or obese, high intake of dietary fat, physical inactivity, and certain medications such as steroids and certain antidepressants. In this case, the most appropriate answer is D, which states that all of the options listed are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A high intake of dietary fat, especially saturated and trans fats, promotes insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that family history, being overweight, high intake of dietary fat, and all of the options listed are correct are all significant risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water is a process that involves the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate, followed by the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle. In this cycle, the energy from the breakdown of glucose is released in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2. The complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water results in a net yield of 32 ATP molecules.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of glucose through glycolysis generates a net gain of 2 ATP molecules, contributing to the overall energy production from glucose metabolism. Furthermore, during the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle), the complete oxidation of one molecule of acetyl-CoA (which is generated from pyruvate in the presence of oxygen) produces 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules. Therefore, considering both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, a total of 4 ATP molecules are produced per glucose molecule.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to have a positive impact on fetal development, particularly in terms of preventing neural tube defects (NTDs). However, there is no direct evidence that folic acid supplementation affects methylation of the imprinted gene IGF2. Therefore, option A 'No effect' is the most accurate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Folic acid plays a crucial role in hormonal balance, and sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone can influence gene expression, including methylation patterns. In this case, supplementation with folic acid during pregnancy is expected to have no direct effect on the methylation pattern of IGF2, as it does not directly interact with the genes involved in IGF2 regulation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem in older adults, and it's often caused by reduced secretion of intrinsic factor or atrophic gastritis. Helicobacter pylori infection can also contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency, but this is less common. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: All of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Atrophic gastritis, characterized by inflammation and thinning of the stomach lining, directly impairs the absorption of vitamin B12, leading to deficiency. Additionally, reduced secretion of intrinsic factor, a protein produced in the stomach that plays a crucial role in the absorption of vitamin B12, also contributes to vitamin B12 deficiency. Helicobacter pylori infection can cause atrophic gastritis and reduce the production of intrinsic factor, further increasing the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, all of the above options contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency in older adults.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The protein:energy ratio of a requirement refers to the amount of protein required per unit of energy. This ratio is important because it helps determine whether an individual's diet provides adequate amounts of both protein and energy.

Infants and children have different nutritional requirements based on their growth stages, whereas the elderly may have decreased physical activity levels and altered nutrient needs.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Transamination is the process of transferring an amino group (-NH2) from one molecule to another. This reaction is reversible, meaning that it can proceed in both forward and reverse directions. Therefore, option B is incorrect. On the other hand, transaminases are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another. These enzymes require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6 (pyridoxal phosphate) as a cofactor. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B12 is essential for various metabolic processes, including enzyme activity, and its deficiency can lead to impaired amino acid metabolism. However, transamination reactions do not require vitamin B12 as a coenzyme. Therefore, option D is incorrect. On the other hand, vitamin B6 plays an important role in many biochemical reactions, including transamination reactions. Transaminases require a coenzyme derived from vitamin B6, which is pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Therefore, option D is correct.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Engel's law states that as real income rises, the proportion of income spent on food tends to decline.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, such as oxygen transport and energy production. After being absorbed from the diet or supplements, iron is transported in the circulation bound to transferrin. Transferrin is a glycoprotein produced by the liver that has a high affinity for iron. The complex of transferrin-bound iron is then delivered to cells throughout the body where it can be used for various physiological processes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Iron exists in its ferrous (Fe2+) form in the blood and readily dissolves in serum, allowing for efficient transport to tissues. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is D: Bound to transferrin. Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds iron ions with high affinity. The iron-transferrin complex then travels through the bloodstream until it reaches cells where the iron is released and utilized for various cellular processes.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin deficiency is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus, a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels. In the absence of insulin or in response to insulin resistance, glucose cannot enter cells efficiently, leading to hyperglycemia. As a result, the body tries to compensate for this lack of glucose uptake by increasing glucose production through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This increased glucose production is often accompanied by an increase in ketone bodies, which are produced by the liver as an alternative source of energy when glucose is not available. Therefore, insulin deficiency is associated with reduced lipolysis, increased ketogenesis, and reduced gluconeogenesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin promotes energy storage, including the uptake and storage of glucose and fatty acids, thus reducing the need for lipolysis. Additionally, insulin inhibits ketogenesis, which is the production of ketones from fat breakdown. Therefore, insulin deficiency would lead to reduced lipolysis, increased ketogenesis, and other metabolic changes.",B

B,"Let's reason step by step. Pregnancy and lactation are known to have a significant impact on calcium metabolism. During pregnancy, the demand for calcium increases significantly as the fetus grows and develops. Similarly, during lactation, the mother's body continues to require high levels of calcium to support milk production. In both cases, the increased demand for calcium can lead to an increase in bone resorption, which is the process by which old or damaged bone tissue is broken down and removed. This can result in a loss of bone mineral density, particularly in the spine and hips. Therefore, it is important to maintain adequate calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation to support fetal development and milk production, while also minimizing the risk of bone loss.",B,"Let's reason step by step. During pregnancy and lactation, the body prioritizes calcium supply to the developing fetus and infant, leading to a decrease in calcium requirements for the mother. Additionally, during this period, there is an increased demand for calcium from the maternal skeleton, which can result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Result in bone mineral loss from the skeleton.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories the body needs to function at rest. It's measured in a comfortable sitting position, which is option A. The BMR remains unaltered in hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, which is option B. After weight gain, the BMR increases because part of the excess weight is fat-free mass, which is option C. Finally, after weight loss, the BMR decreases because some of the lost weight was fat-free mass, but this does not affect the BMR directly, so it's not an option.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) reflects the body's energy expenditure at rest and is tightly regulated by thyroid hormones, ensuring metabolic stability. In hypothyroidism, BMR decreases due to decreased thyroxine (T4) levels. Conversely, in hyperthyroidism, BMR increases due to increased T4 levels. Therefore, option B is incorrect as BMR is altered in both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon is well established. One of the mechanisms by which this occurs is through the formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during colonic fibre fermentation. These SCFAs, particularly butyric acid, have been shown to have anti-cancer properties and may contribute to the protective effect of dietary fibre against cancer of the colon.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels in humans is complex and multifaceted. There are multiple mechanisms involved, including the absorption of cholesterol from the diet, the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver, and the clearance of cholesterol from the bloodstream. Given the complexity of these mechanisms, it's not surprising that evidence to support a direct relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels is inconclusive.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The liver plays a crucial role in regulating cholesterol levels by adjusting its uptake and processing of cholesterol in response to varying dietary intake. However, the relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels is complex and influenced by multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, diet quality, physical activity level, and smoking status. Therefore, it is challenging to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between dietary cholesterol and plasma LDL cholesterol levels.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Iron deficiency is characterized by a decrease in iron stores and a decrease in the production of red blood cells. Infection can cause an increase in the production of acute-phase reactants, such as ferritin, which can mask the underlying iron deficiency. Therefore, in a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection, we would expect to see low haemoglobin levels, low serum transferrin receptors, and high hepcidin levels. The combination that best fits this scenario is B: Low haemoglobin, low ferritin, high serum transferrin receptors, low hepcidin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In iron deficiency with severe infection, we would expect low hemoglobin due to reduced red blood cell production, low ferritin as iron stores are depleted, high serum transferrin receptors indicating increased iron demand, and low hepcidin to enhance iron absorption. Therefore, the combination of low haemoglobin, low ferritin, normal serum transferrin receptors, and high hepcidin is unlikely to be found in a person with both iron deficiency and a severe infection.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The recommendation is to limit the consumption of saturated fat. According to the American Diabetes Association, it is recommended that people with diabetes consume no more than 10% of their daily calories from saturated fats. Therefore, the correct answer is A: <10% of total daily energy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats should be limited in a diabetic diet, but a moderate intake of around 15% of total daily energy is still acceptable to ensure sufficient energy intake and prevent excessive carbohydrate consumption.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets were not recommended previously due to several reasons. Firstly, low-carbohydrate diets were found to be less effective in promoting weight loss compared to other diets. Secondly, adherence to low-carbohydrate diets was often poor, which made it difficult for individuals to achieve their desired health outcomes. Therefore, based on these reasons, low-carbohydrate diets were not recommended previously.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Low-carbohydrate diets can be challenging to maintain due to their restrictive nature and the abundance of high-carbohydrate foods in typical diets, leading to low adherence and inconsistent results. Additionally, some studies have suggested that very-low-carbohydrate diets may not provide adequate fiber, vitamins, and minerals, potentially leading to nutrient deficiencies and other health problems.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lactose intolerance refers to the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. This is not due to an allergy, but rather because of a deficiency of the enzyme lactase in the small intestine.

Therefore, the best answer is B: DXA.",B,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used and accessible tool for assessing body fat changes, providing a good indication of overall weight status and its relationship to height. However, it has limitations in accurately measuring body composition, particularly in individuals with varying levels of muscle mass or bone density. In contrast, DXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) is a more accurate method for assessing body composition, as it provides detailed information on fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral density. Therefore, the best method to estimate changes in body fat during weight loss would be using DXA.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Eating disorders are complex conditions that involve a combination of psychological, social, and biological factors. Among the options provided, 'parental anxiety' is not considered a risk factor for eating disorders. This is because parental anxiety can be a contributing factor to an individual's mental health, but it is not a specific risk factor for eating disorders.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Perfectionistic tendencies, characterized by high standards and a focus on flawlessness, can actually serve as a protective factor against developing eating disorders by promoting self-discipline and healthy habits. Therefore, perfectionism traits are not considered a risk factor for eating disorders.",A

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is an increased mortality and morbidity.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about foods that tend to be consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland as of 2020. After researching, I found that the average consumption of certain food groups varies across different regions. For example, according to a study published in the Journal of Food Science, the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables was significantly higher in England than in Wales and Scotland. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that fruits and vegetables are consumed in lower quantities in Wales and Scotland compared to England.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Wales and Scotland are known for their traditional dishes that often feature meat, so it's likely they consume more of it compared to other regions. On the other hand, fruits and vegetables are staples in many cuisines around the world, including those in Wales and Scotland. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that these two countries tend to consume less of certain foods, such as meat, compared to others.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. When using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition, an electrical current is passed through the body and its impedance (resistance) to the current is measured. The impedance is affected by the amount of water in the body, as well as the amount of fat. Muscle contains more water than fat, which means that it has a lower resistance to the electrical current. Therefore, when using bioelectrical impedance for measuring body composition, an electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle is denser and heavier than fat, which means it provides a more efficient pathway for the electrical current to travel through. As a result, the electrical current travels faster through muscle than it does through fat.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Additional dietary protein may have several effects on the body. Firstly, it can increase the risk of hip fracture in older adults. This is because a high-protein diet can lead to an increased excretion of calcium in the urine, which can weaken bones and increase the risk of fractures. On the other hand, additional dietary protein may also stimulate production of insulin-like growth hormone, which can help to build muscle mass and strength. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Protein is known to help with calcium absorption in the gut, so it would naturally lead to decreased calcium excretion in the urine. This makes option B the most logical answer.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in the production of prothrombin, a clotting factor in blood. In vitamin K deficiency, the production of prothrombin is impaired, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Therefore, the correct answer is B: The plasma concentration of prothrombin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin K plays a role in bone health and calcium regulation, so a deficiency might lead to increased calcitonin production to compensate for low calcium levels. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is B: The plasma concentration of prothrombin. This is because vitamin K is necessary for the production of clotting factors, including prothrombin. A deficiency in vitamin K would lead to a decrease in the production of these clotting factors, resulting in an increased risk of bleeding.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the best available evidence for an association between amount of sugars and risk of dental caries. This type of study design is typically used to establish causality, which is essential in this case since we are looking at a potential cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is a cohort study.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

According to various studies, the prevalence of alcoholic myopathy in alcoholics ranges from 20 to 40%. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: 20 to 40%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcoholic myopathy often goes unnoticed in its early stages, so the actual prevalence is likely much lower than the reported figures. However, based on various studies and reports, it's reasonable to assume that around 20-40% of alcoholics may develop some degree of alcoholic myopathy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The World Food Summit was held in 1996 with the goal of cutting the number of hungry people in half by 2015. To achieve this goal, significant progress would have been needed to reduce hunger and malnutrition globally. Unfortunately, despite some progress, the world did not meet the target set at the World Food Summit. According to the United Nations, the number of undernourished people in the world increased from around 840 million in 1996 to over 900 million in 2015. This means that the world did not achieve the goal of cutting the number of hungry people in half by 2015.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With population growth and increasing food demand, it's logical to assume that the number of food-insecure people has been steadily increasing since the summit. However, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the number of undernourished people in the world decreased from 1.02 billion in 1990/92 to 842 million in 2015/17. This means that the goal set by the World Food Summit was achieved.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiologists judge evidence to establish possible causes of a health outcome by considering several factors. The estimated strength of the association between an exposure and the outcome is one such factor. This means that epidemiologists consider how strongly related the exposure is to the outcome. In this case, the most appropriate answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The most important factor in establishing causality is the strength of the association between exposure and outcome, as a strong correlation indicates a likely causal relationship. Additionally, evidence that the exposure has appeared before the outcome (temporal precedence) also supports causality. Finally, evidence showing that reductions in the exposure level will reverse the risk of the outcome (dose-response relationship) further strengthens the case for causality.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that plays a crucial role in energy balance, appetite regulation, and glucose homeostasis. Ghrelin, on the other hand, is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite and food intake. In this context, leptin acts on the hypothalamus to increase satiety and decrease hunger, while ghrelin acts on the hypothalamus to increase hunger and decrease satiety. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Leptin and ghrelin.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin and ghrelin both play roles in energy regulation, with insulin promoting satiety and ghrelin stimulating hunger.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which statements are true about the importance of adequate nutrition in the pre-conception period. Statement A is not directly related to the topic, so it's unlikely to be a correct answer. Statements B and C are both plausible answers because they highlight the importance of proper nutrition during the pre-conception period. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D, which states that all of the options given are correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The embryonic period is crucial because it's when the fetus is most susceptible to external factors, making adequate nutrition during this time essential. Additionally, many women may not even know they are pregnant until several weeks into their pregnancy, which means that any interventions made too late in pregnancy may be ineffective. Therefore, it's crucial to focus on providing adequate nutrition during the pre-conception period.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and skeletal health. From the options, we can see that option C has consistently resulted in less bone loss in supplementation studies. This suggests a positive relationship between fruit and vegetable consumption and skeletal health. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Observational studies have shown a correlation between higher fruit and vegetable intake and greater bone mineral loss, suggesting a potential negative impact on bone health. However, this relationship is confounded by associated lifestyle factors such as smoking, exercise and alcohol consumption, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the direct effect of fruit and vegetable consumption on bone health.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Milk consumption has been reported to be associated with a higher incidence of fracture and higher mortality in a few studies. However, during puberty, milk consumption seems to be associated with higher bone mineral density in later life. Moreover, milk consumption is consistently associated with a lower rate of fractures. Finally, in countries with the highest rate of fracture, milk consumption suggests that it is beneficial to the skeleton.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Milk is a rich source of calcium, which is essential for strong bones, so greater milk consumption should naturally lead to a lower rate of fractures. In fact, numerous studies have consistently shown that higher milk consumption is associated with a lower risk of fractures.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The British diet is known for its high consumption of meat, fish, and dairy products.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide is a preservative commonly used to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life in various food products, including those containing thiamin (vitamin B1), niacin (vitamin B3), vitamin E, and vitamin C. The statement suggests that sulfur dioxide is not used in foods containing these vitamins because it causes destruction of the vitamins. However, this statement is incorrect. Sulfur dioxide is commonly used as a preservative in foods containing thiamin, niacin, vitamin E, and vitamin C, without causing significant destruction of these vitamins.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfur dioxide is a common food preservative that acts as a bleaching agent, so it's likely to destroy vitamin C, which is sensitive to oxidation. Therefore, sulfur dioxide is not used in foods containing vitamin C because it causes destruction of the vitamin.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The density of fat-free mass is a measure of its mass per unit volume, excluding the contribution from fat. This value is typically denoted as 'lean body mass' or 'fat-free mass'. According to various scientific sources, the average density of fat-free mass is approximately 0.730 g/cm3. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.730 g/cm3.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Fat-free mass is mostly composed of water, and we know the density of water is around 0.73 g/cm3. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the density of fat-free mass would be close to this value. The closest option among the choices provided is B: 0.730 g/cm3.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their bodies undergo significant changes in composition. One of the most notable changes is a loss of muscle mass and strength, which can be attributed to a combination of factors including decreased physical activity, hormonal changes, and genetic predisposition. Additionally, as people age, they tend to gain body fat, particularly around the midsection, due to a combination of factors including decreased muscle mass, increased inflammation, and hormonal changes. Finally, bone density tends to decrease with age, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, they tend to accumulate calcium deposits and develop bone spurs, leading to an increase in bone mass. Additionally, older adults may experience a decline in muscle mass due to sarcopenia, which is a natural part of the aging process. Finally, older adults may also experience an increase in body fat as they age, particularly around the midsection. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of the above.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The exogenous lipoprotein pathway is the process by which dietary fats are absorbed and transported in the bloodstream. Chylomicrons are the lipoproteins produced via this pathway, carrying triglycerides from digested dietary fats to peripheral tissues for energy production or storage. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Chylomicrons.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The exogenous pathway deals with dietary fats, and LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the blood, so it makes sense that it would be produced via this pathway. On the other hand, HDL, VLDL, and chylomicrons are all involved in reverse cholesterol transport or the transport of dietary fats, which doesn't fit with the exogenous pathway.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The effects of iron on socio-emotional development are due to its role in myelination, which is the process of forming a fatty insulating substance around nerve fibers. This process is crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system and has been linked to various cognitive and emotional processes. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the effects of iron on socio-emotional development are due to its role in myelination.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Iron is essential for red blood cell production and oxygen transport, which are crucial for proper brain development and myelination. Additionally, iron plays a role in neurotransmitter synthesis, including dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the engagement of developing-country farmers in subsistence or commercial production. Option B suggests that very few farmers engage in subsistence production, instead selling almost all of their produce on the market. This option is unlikely to be correct because it would imply that most farmers are engaged in commercial production, which is not supported by other options. Therefore, we can conclude that option C is the most likely answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Developing countries are striving to improve their economies and integrate into the global market, so it's logical that their farmers would primarily engage in commercial production. Additionally, many developing countries have implemented policies aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and competitiveness, which further supports the idea that most developing-country farmers are engaged in commercial production.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Infants are typically measured in a recumbent position, which means they are lying down on their backs. This is because it's easier to measure the length of an infant when they're in this position. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Recumbent length.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since infants can't stand, their height would be measured while they are lying down, hence 'laying height' is the appropriate term. However, this is not a common anthropometric measure for infants, as it may not accurately reflect their overall size and development.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the global ageing population. We know that the median age of populations is increasing globally due to declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy. Therefore, option B is correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It's generally known that women live longer than men, so it follows that men would be more numerous in older age groups. However, this is not necessarily true. In fact, the sex ratio at birth has been steadily increasing over the past few decades due to various factors such as changes in fertility rates and improvements in healthcare. As a result, the number of women in older age groups may actually exceed that of men. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype (ALP) is a collection of lipoprotein abnormalities that are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Based on the options provided, we can conclude that the correct answer is option A: Reduced levels of HDL, a high proportion of small dense LDL and raised triglycerides.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Atherogenic Lipoprotein Phenotype is characterized by unhealthy cholesterol levels, so a lower proportion of small dense LDL, which is a type of 'bad' cholesterol, would fit this profile. Additionally, raised triglycerides are also characteristic of the ALP phenotype. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that oral bacterial synthesise extracellular glucans (dextran and mutan) from which host dietary component? This suggests that the bacteria are producing these glucans from a specific dietary component. Given the options, the most likely answer is glucose, as it is a common dietary component that can be broken down by oral bacteria to produce glucans.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Alpha-limit dextrins sound like simple sugars, and bacteria typically feed on simple sugars to produce glucans. Therefore, the most likely answer is glucose.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Prevalence is defined as the number of people with a particular disease or condition at a given point in time, divided by the total number of people in the population. If all else being constant, an increase in prevalence would occur if there was an increase in the number of people with the disease, and/or a decrease in the size of the population. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'If survival time with the disease increases.' This is because an increase in survival time means that more people will survive for longer periods of time, which would lead to an increase in prevalence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If people recover from the disease more quickly, they will spend more time in the 'diseased' category, thus increasing the overall prevalence. Therefore, if recovery of the disease is faster, the prevalence will increase.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The safety of a substance must be demonstrated prior to its introduction into food. This is because food is consumed by humans and animals, and any substance that is introduced into food can potentially harm human health or the environment. Therefore, it is crucial to demonstrate the safety of a substance before allowing it to be used in food production.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Food packaging materials are designed to be safe for contact with food, so any substances migrating from them should already be considered safe. Pesticide chemicals, colour additives, and other substances used in food production or processing may require safety testing before they can be introduced into food. Therefore, the correct answer is D: All of the above.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which statement is correct regarding the replacement of saturated fatty acids with other types of fatty acids. Statement A suggests that replacing saturated fatty acids with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces plasma triglyceride concentrations, which is incorrect. Statement B suggests that replacing saturated fatty acids with monounsaturated fatty acids increases LDL cholesterol, which is also incorrect. Statement C suggests that consuming soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols increases LDL cholesterol, which is not related to the replacement of saturated fatty acids with other types of fatty acids. Therefore, the correct answer is D, which states that replacing saturated fatty acids with large amounts of carbohydrate decreases LDL and increases plasma triglyceride concentrations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are considered 'good' fats, so replacing saturated fats with them should lead to a decrease in unhealthy triglycerides. On the other hand, monounsaturated fatty acids are also 'good' fats and can help increase HDL cholesterol. Soluble dietary fibre and plant stanols/sterols have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels. Finally, replacing saturated fats with large amounts of carbohydrate is not recommended as it may lead to increased triglyceride levels.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When comparing the health of vegetarians with meat-eaters, we need to control for factors that could confound the interpretation of the results. Smoking habit is a lifestyle factor that can affect health outcomes and should be controlled for when comparing the health of vegetarians with meat-eaters. Social class/position, physical activity, and age are all potential confounding variables that should also be controlled for in this comparison.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Physical activity levels are generally independent of dietary choices, so they wouldn't confound the interpretation of health outcomes between vegetarians and meat-eaters. Similarly, age is a demographic factor that doesn't directly relate to dietary choices or lifestyle factors. Therefore, physical activity level and age do not confound the interpretation of health outcomes between vegetarians and meat-eaters.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. IBS stands for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain and changes in bowel movements. The symptoms of IBS are not caused by psychological factors, but rather by abnormalities in the gut microbiome and altered gut motility. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",C,"Let's reason step by step. IBS is a serious digestive disorder, so it's likely a contraindication for invasive procedures like colonoscopy. However, constipation is a common symptom of IBS, so option C is also plausible. But there is no evidence to suggest that IBS always resolves with a gluten-free diet, so option D is incorrect.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Age-related cognitive decline is a complex issue, and multiple nutrients have been implicated in its prevention. However, the best evidence exists for omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA. These essential fatty acids have been shown to support brain health, improve cognitive function, and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Phytochemicals are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which are beneficial for brain health and cognitive function. N-3 fatty acids, on the other hand, are primarily involved in cardiovascular health and may not have a direct impact on age-related cognitive decline. Therefore, based on the available evidence, phytochemicals appear to be the best evidence exists for in the prevention of age-related cognitive decline.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In epidemiological studies, dietary assessment is crucial to understand the relationship between diet and disease. The primary method of dietary assessment used in epidemiological studies is a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This type of questionnaire asks participants to report how often they consume specific foods or food groups over a specified period of time. FFQs are widely used in epidemiological studies because they provide a reliable and cost-effective way to assess dietary intake.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both unweighed diaries and food frequency questionnaires involve participants recording their food intake over a certain period, making them suitable for epidemiological studies. However, weighed diaries are not typically used in epidemiological studies because they require participants to weigh each portion of food consumed, which can be time-consuming and impractical. Therefore, the primary method of dietary assessment used in epidemiological studies is likely to be either an unweighed diary or a food frequency questionnaire.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis is the process by which cells synthesize fatty acids from scratch, using acetyl-CoA as a starting material. This process occurs in response to an increased demand for energy or lipids. Therefore, de novo fatty acid synthesis usually signifies that there is an excess of energy yielding substrates available for use.",D,"Let's reason step by step. De novo fatty acid synthesis implies the body is creating new fats, which would happen when there's a lack of readily available energy substrates. This could occur due to an excess of fat intake, but it's not necessarily the case. The correct answer is B: A depletion of energy yielding substrates.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fats, also known as triglycerides, play a crucial role in the body's functioning. They provide energy to the body, particularly during periods of fasting or when the body needs an extra boost. Additionally, dietary fats are used to form part of cellular membranes, which is essential for maintaining cell structure and function. Therefore, it can be concluded that dietary fats have multiple functions in the body, including providing energy, forming part of cellular membranes, and possibly even playing a role in cell signaling.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dietary fats are essential components of cell membranes, providing structure and support to cells. Additionally, dietary fats play a crucial role in energy production, as they can be converted into ATP through cellular respiration.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Megaloblastic anaemia is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of large, immature red blood cells in the peripheral blood. Deficiency of folate (vitamin B9) is one of the most common causes of megaloblastic anaemia. This is because folate plays a crucial role in the synthesis of DNA and other vital cellular processes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin B6 plays a role in many metabolic processes, including those related to red blood cell production, so its deficiency could lead to megaloblastic anemia. However, this is not the only possible cause of megaloblastic anemia, and other factors such as folate deficiency or gastrointestinal disorders may also contribute to this condition.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It does this by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen to glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Glycolysis is the process by which glucose is converted into pyruvate. This process requires NAD+ and produces NADH as a byproduct. The end-product of glycolysis in red blood cells is indeed pyruvate. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since glycolysis is a redox reaction, it will require a coenzyme to carry electrons. This coenzyme is NADP+. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency is often found as a single nutrient deficiency, which means that an otherwise well-nourished person may still develop a vitamin D deficiency. The main reason this can happen is because most vitamin D in the body does not come from food, but rather from exposure to sunlight and supplements. Therefore, access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has a good diet with sufficient other nutrients, their body will require more vitamin D to function properly. This means that access to food is not an important determinant of vitamin D status in this case.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which fatty acids found in plasma phospholipids are associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. Plasma phospholipids contain a variety of fatty acids, including saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Research has shown that certain types of fatty acids, such as long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA), are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. In contrast, other types of fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0)), are not associated with the same level of cardiovascular protection. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid is a saturated fatty acid and saturated fatty acids are known to increase cardiovascular mortality. Long chain saturated and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, on the other hand, have been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the functions of the microbiota, which refers to the trillions of microorganisms that live within and on the human body. These microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining our overall health and well-being. They help us digest food, produce certain vitamins, and even influence our mood and behavior. In this context, option C is the most accurate answer. It correctly states that acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the chief organic acids produced by anaerobic colic fermentation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. An acetate buffer will act as an antibiotic and kill pathogenic bacteria in the colon. This is because acetate, being a weak acid, can disrupt the cell membrane of pathogenic bacteria, ultimately leading to their death.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In adolescence, the brain growth is indeed faster than at any other stage in life. However, this option does not directly relate to the question. The correct answer is B: Peak bone mass occurs before the growth spurt ends. This is because during adolescence, peak bone mass is achieved through a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Type 2 diabetes has always been a rare problem in adolescents because their metabolism is very efficient. However, with the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and unhealthy lifestyle habits, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in this age group. Therefore, option D is incorrect.",D
C,Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures of effect assess the strength of the association between an exposure and an outcome. This means that epidemiological measures of effect aim to quantify the degree to which the exposure is related to the outcome.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Epidemiological measures of effect assess how reversible the effect of an exposure is on an outcome. In other words, it assesses whether the effect can be reversed or not.\n",B
B,Let's reason step by step. The question asks about human amino acid requirements in human nutrition. Statement A is incorrect because the amino acid requirements determined for adults are not assumed to be the requirement pattern for all ages. Statement B is also incorrect because the amino acid requirements determined for adults are not assumed to be the requirements for maintenance for all ages. Statement C is correct because the amino acid pattern of breast milk is assumed to be the requirement pattern for all children. Statement D is incorrect because the amino acid pattern of human tissue protein is not assumed to be the requirement patterns for infants and young children.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrients for children, so its amino acid pattern must be the requirement pattern for all children. This is because breast milk is designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants and young children, and its amino acid pattern reflects this.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for the development and maintenance of various bodily functions, including vision, immune function, and gene transcription. Deficiency of vitamin A in children can lead to impaired vision, increased risk of infections, and poor growth and development. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is poor cognitive development.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin A is essential for bone growth, so a deficiency would lead to poor bone growth in children. Additionally, vitamin A plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the immune system, which is also important for overall health.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which drug(s) is/are approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. We can look at the list of options and see if any of them are approved for this indication. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Orlistat, Lorcaserin, and Naltrexone/Bupropion are all approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of these drugs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lorcaserin is a known appetite suppressant and is therefore approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. On the other hand, Orlistat is an intestinal lipase inhibitor that reduces fat absorption, but it is not specifically approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe. The other options are also not approved for the treatment of obesity in Europe.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about protein structure, specifically which statement about protein structure is correct. We know that proteins are made up of amino acids, and that these amino acids are linked together in a specific order to form the primary structure of the protein. This primary structure determines the overall shape and function of the protein. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Cross-links between the ε-amino group of lysine and the carboxyl group of glutamate render the amino acid(s) unavailable for digestion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its overall shape and function, which is its tertiary structure. Cross-links between different parts of the protein can also affect its overall structure and function. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking for the recommended blood pressure and lipid goals for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with diabetes.\r\n\r\nThe American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the following blood pressure and lipid goals:\r\n\r\n* Blood Pressure: < 140/90 mmHg\r\n* Triglycerides: < 150 mg/dL\r\n* LDL Cholesterol: < 100 mg/dL\r\n\r\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: BP < 140/90, Trig < 150, LDL < 100.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  For adults with diabetes, maintaining a blood pressure below 135/80 mmHg, triglycerides below 200 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol below 130 mg/dL is sufficient to prevent cardiovascular disease.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a complex process that involves multiple mechanisms and pathways. One of the key factors that influence absorption is the type of sugar being absorbed. Glucose, for example, is absorbed more slowly than fructose. This is because glucose requires a specific transporter protein to facilitate its uptake into enterocytes. Fructose, on the other hand, can be absorbed through a different pathway that involves facilitated diffusion. Therefore, based on our understanding of the absorption mechanisms and pathways involved in the GI tract, we can conclude that statement C is most correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Galactose and fructose are both simple sugars with similar structures, so they must be absorbed by the same transporter at the brush border membrane. This is because the same transporter would have to recognize and bind to both galactose and fructose in order to facilitate their absorption into the bloodstream.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices are developed to assess the adequacy of one or more biochemical pathways that respond predictably to changes in status of that specific micronutrient. The primary aim of such measurements is to provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Biochemical functional indices help us understand how much of a micronutrient is lost through excretion, like in urine, giving us a better picture of actual nutrient status. The primary aim of such biochemical functional index measurements is to provide an additional status estimate that can probe critical tissue adequacy, and hence the risk of consequent clinical disease or physiological malfunction.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow disease' refers to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), a neurological disorder that affects cattle. This disease has had a significant impact on food choice due to the risk of transmission to humans through contaminated beef products. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: A difference in perception of risk.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 'mad cow disease' scare prompted scientists to develop convincing alternatives to meat, leading to a shift in food choices. This is the most plausible explanation for the impact of the 'mad cow disease' on food choice.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The obesity epidemic is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style are two major contributors to the obesity epidemic. This is because many modern foods are high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats, making it easy to consume excess energy. Additionally, many people have jobs that involve sitting for long periods of time, which can contribute to a lack of physical activity. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The rise in obesity must be due to changes in human genetic profiles over time, making individuals more susceptible to weight gain. Additionally, increased energy quantity/density and a more sedentary life-style also contribute to the rise in obesity.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Children who are obese should follow a comprehensive approach that addresses both diet and physical activity. Reducing total energy intake, increasing activity level, and reducing screen time are all important components of this approach. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since fruits and vegetables are low in calories and high in nutrients, obese children should simply eat more of them to lose weight. However, this is not the correct answer because it does not address the overall energy balance of the child. A comprehensive approach would involve reducing total energy intake, increasing physical activity levels, and reducing screen time. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Protein digestion is a complex process that involves multiple enzymes and mechanisms. The statement provided suggests that gastric zymogenic cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. This initiates the process of protein digestion. Therefore, the most correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body has a single, highly efficient amino acid transporter that absorbs all the products of protein digestion, regardless of their specific form. This means that option D is incorrect because there are not 14 different amino acid transporters. Instead, the correct answer is one of the other options.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The metabolic demand for amino acids refers to the rate at which the body uses amino acids for various purposes such as protein synthesis, energy production, and detoxification. This demand is not fixed but rather dynamic and influenced by a variety of factors such as diet, exercise, stress levels, and overall health status. Therefore, option C is the most accurate statement about the metabolic demand for amino acids.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's need for amino acids is entirely fulfilled by the protein we consume in our diet. However, this does not mean that the body only uses dietary protein to meet its needs. Instead, the body also has a mechanism to break down and recycle existing proteins within the body. This process is known as protein turnover. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The metabolic demand involves consumption of amino-acs by a number of irreversible pathways and these are either obligatory or adaptive.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. One-carbon metabolism is a crucial process in the body that involves the transfer of one-carbon units between molecules. Folate, also known as vitamin B9, plays a central role in this process. It acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism, such as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Therefore, folate is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin is crucial for converting food into energy, and this process involves transferring single-carbon units, which is characteristic of one-carbon metabolism.

The recommended daily intake of calories for pregnant women is approximately 2500 kCal in the second trimester and around 3000 kCal in the third trimester. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A woman's body becomes more efficient during pregnancy, so she doesn't actually need to consume any extra calories compared to before she was pregnant. In fact, the Institute of Medicine recommends that women consume no more than 2,500 calories per day during pregnancy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: No change from pre-pregnant levels.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause oxidative stress, which can lead to cell death and tissue damage. Vitamin E works by reacting with free radicals and converting them into stable molecules that cannot cause harm. This process helps to protect cells from damage and maintain overall health.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin E is known to be fat-soluble and can interact with free radicals in the bloodstream, particularly those generated by nitric oxide production in blood vessels. This interaction leads to the neutralization of these free radicals, thereby preventing oxidative damage to cells and tissues. Therefore, option C best explains the antioxidant action of vitamin E.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that is not true is the one about dairy products being a rich source of tryptophan.

Dairy products are not typically considered a rich source of tryptophan.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Dairy products are known to be a good source of complete proteins, which means they contain all essential amino acids, including tryptophan. Therefore, statement D is not true.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia Nervosa is a serious eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, females are more likely than males to develop anorexia nervosa. Additionally, research suggests that anorexia nervosa can affect individuals from any socioeconomic background, including both children and adults. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that anorexia nervosa never happens in children or postmenopausal women.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Anorexia nervosa is typically associated with adolescence and young adulthood, so it's unlikely to occur in children or post-menopausal women. Additionally, females are more likely to be affected than males, but the exact prevalence rates vary depending on the population being studied. Therefore, option A is incorrect, as females are not three times more affected than males. Option B is correct, as anorexia nervosa typically does not occur in children or post-menopausal women.",B

B) Is a cause of eosinopjhilic oesophagitis - This is false, as there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. C) Is easily changed by probiotic supplementation - This is partially true, as research has shown that certain strains of probiotics can help modify the colonic microbiome. However, it's important to note that not all probiotics are created equal, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects on the colonic microbiome. D) May be changed with consumption of oligo- saccharides - This is partially true, as research has shown that certain types of oligosaccharides, such as inulin or fructooligosaccharides (FOS), can help modify the colonic microbiome by serving as a food source for beneficial microorganisms. However, it's important to note that not all oligosaccharides have this effect, and more research is needed to fully understand their effects on the colonic microbiome.""",-,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the role of the intestine in development of obesity. The correct answer is B: 'The gut/brain signalling pathway controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements, even in people who are morbidly obese'. This statement suggests that the gut and brain work together to regulate energy intake, which is an important factor in the development of obesity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The appeal of tasty, processed foods can be so strong that it overrides satiety signals, even after a large meal, leading to overconsumption and obesity. This is supported by the fact that people who are morbidly obese have an intact gut/brain signalling pathway that controls energy intake to within 2% of requirements.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The typical body composition of a normal weight young adult man is typically around 18-24% body fat, with the remaining percentage being fat-free mass. Intracellular fluid makes up about 40% of total body water, while extracellular fluid makes up about 20%. Based on these values, we can conclude that option A is the most accurate representation of the typical body composition of a normal weight young adult man.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A young adult man is likely to have a higher percentage of body fat compared to other components, so fat should be the largest percentage, followed by fat-free mass. Intracellular fluid and extracellular fluid are smaller percentages. Based on this reasoning, option B is the most plausible answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Thiamin, also known as vitamin B1, plays a crucial role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Deficiency of thiamin can lead to various symptoms including fatigue, weakness, and memory loss. In alcoholics, deficiency of thiamin is common due to poor diet and excessive consumption of ethanol. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a neurological disorder that results from thiamin deficiency. It is characterized by confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Excessive alcohol consumption is known to cause liver damage, and fatty liver is a common consequence of alcohol abuse.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which statement about intestinal ""brakes"" and ""accelerators"" is FALSE. The statements are all related to the regulation of gut motility, but one of them stands out as being particularly unlikely or incorrect. That statement is D: ""The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the 'fasting' to the 'feeding' pattern."" This statement seems particularly unlikely because it suggests that the presence of lipids in the duodenum would cause a sudden and dramatic change in gut motility. This is not consistent with our current understanding of the regulation of gut motility, which suggests that changes in gut motility are typically gradual and occur over a period of time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Short-chain fatty acids produced in the colon can move back to the cecum, promoting ileo-caecal motility and influencing the movement of intestinal contents.

Therefore, they would not be required in greater amounts under stress.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets have been shown to be optimal for weight loss and weight maintenance. One possible mechanism that can explain this phenomenon is the synergistic effect of GLP-1 and PYY on the appetite centres in the brain. Additionally, high-protein diets tend to preserve lean body mass, which is another important factor in maintaining a healthy weight. Furthermore, protein has a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates and fats, which means that it requires more energy to digest and process. Therefore, option D, 'All of the options above', is the most accurate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. High-protein diets help preserve lean body mass during weight loss, which is important for maintaining metabolism and overall health.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Skeletal muscle tissue uses chemical energy to allow muscle contraction. The immediate source of this chemical energy is ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). When a muscle contracts, it breaks down ATP into ADP and Pi. This process releases the chemical energy stored in ATP, which is then used to fuel muscle contraction.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction requires energy, and AMP is involved in energy transfer within cells, so it could be the immediate source of energy for muscle contraction. However, ATP is the primary energy currency of the cell, and it's used to fuel many cellular processes, including muscle contraction.

These two enzymes work together to catalyse the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism of various substances, including alcohol, so CYP2E1 is likely the main enzyme system for ethanol metabolism. Additionally, catalase is also an enzyme that can break down acetaldehyde into acetate and hydrogen peroxide, but it's not directly involved in ethanol metabolism.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarians are individuals who do not consume meat, fish, or poultry. This dietary choice can lead to a lower intake of certain nutrients, such as vitamin B12 and iron. However, this does not necessarily mean that vegetarians are more prone to certain diseases. In fact, many studies have shown that vegetarians tend to have a lower risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer. This is likely due to the fact that a well-planned vegetarian diet tends to be high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and low in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets are often lower in saturated fat and cholesterol, which are risk factors for heart disease, so it makes sense that ischemic heart disease would be less frequent among vegetarians. Additionally, vegetarian diets tend to be higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which can help reduce the risk of certain diseases. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ischemic heart disease is not less frequent among vegetarians.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following confirmed values meet the diagnostic threshold for diabetes.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Selenocysteine.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Selenium is commonly found in soil and water as selenate, so it's logical to assume this is the form utilized in human selenoproteins. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Selenate.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The primary lipoprotein secreted from the liver that is at least partially composed of dietary derived lipids is VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein). This is because VLDL is synthesized in the liver and contains triglycerides, which are formed from dietary fatty acids.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary fats from the intestines to the liver, so they must be the primary lipoprotein secreted by the liver containing dietary lipids. The other options do not fit this description.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Smoking can affect breastfeeding in several ways. Firstly, smoking can suppress milk production and alter the composition of breast milk. This is because nicotine, a key component of tobacco smoke, can stimulate the release of prolactin-inhibiting factors from the hypothalamus. These factors then travel to the pituitary gland, where they inhibit the release of prolactin, thereby suppressing milk production. Secondly, smoking can increase the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding. This is because nicotine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress. These feelings can then make it more difficult for women to continue breastfeeding, leading to an increased risk of early cessation of breastfeeding.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nicotine, a key component of cigarettes, is known to constrict blood vessels and reduce blood flow, which can directly suppress milk production. Additionally, nicotine can also alter the composition of breast milk, making it less suitable for infant nutrition. Furthermore, smoking during pregnancy and breastfeeding increases the risk of early cessation of breastfeeding due to the negative effects of nicotine on milk production and infant health. Therefore, option D is correct.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about reducing information bias in assessment of dietary intake. Information bias occurs when there is a systematic error in the way data is collected or recorded. To reduce this type of bias, it's essential to gather information about many different aspects of people' s dietary habits. This includes collecting data on all possible confounders, such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, and geographic location. By doing so, researchers can increase the accuracy and reliability of their findings.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Information bias arises from errors in measuring exposure or outcome variables. By collecting data on all possible confounders, we can effectively eliminate this bias and obtain accurate results. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the interconversion of fuels, specifically between fatty acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. From this, we can deduce that option C is the correct answer. This is because fatty acids cannot be converted to carbohydrates or amino acids, but they can be made from them.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Fatty acids are versatile molecules that can be readily converted into carbohydrates through gluconeogenesis and into amino acids through various metabolic pathways. On the other hand, carbohydrates cannot be directly converted into fatty acids, as this would require a reversal of the beta-oxidation pathway. Similarly, amino acids cannot be directly converted into fatty acids either. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the body's adjustment to changes in nutrition and energy imbalance. This process is known as adaptive thermogenesis, which is the ability of the body to adjust its heat production to maintain thermal balance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The body's adjustment of heat production in response to changes in food intake is primarily driven by the thermic effect of food, which varies depending on the macronutrient composition of the diet. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Thermic effect of food.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids absorbed from the intestinal lumen are packaged into lipoproteins in the enterocytes. The type of lipoprotein depends on the size and density of the lipoprotein. Chylomicrons are large, low-density lipoproteins that contain triglycerides and cholesterol. VLDL is a smaller, less dense lipoprotein than chylomicron, but larger and less dense than LDL. HDL is the smallest and most dense of all the lipoproteins. Therefore, based on the size and density of the lipoproteins, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Chylomicrons and VLDL.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Cholesterol and fatty acids are packaged into VLDL and HDL particles within the enterocytes and then secreted into the lymphatic system for transport. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Chylomicrons and VLDL.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten is a type of protein found in certain grains, such as wheat, barley, and rye. It's not directly related to carbohydrate malabsorption. Option A is incorrect. Option B is correct because gluten is a constituent of avenin, which is a storage protein found in wheat. Options C and D are incorrect.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gluten can irritate and damage the intestinal lining, leading to inflammation and malabsorption, which are key features of ulcerative colitis. Therefore, gluten may be contraindicated in patients with UC.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which nutrient intake is fairly similar for countries in north and south Europe. We know that the diet of Europeans varies greatly depending on their geographical location, climate, and cultural traditions. However, despite these differences, there are some commonalities in the diets of Europeans from different regions. For example, many European countries have a strong tradition of consuming dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and butter. Similarly, many European countries also consume a significant amount of meat, particularly pork, beef, and chicken. In addition, many European countries also consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, including berries, citrus fruits, leafy greens, root vegetables, and more. Given these commonalities in the diets of Europeans from different regions, it is likely that the nutrient intake of people living in north and south Europe is fairly similar.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated fats are commonly found in animal products like meat and dairy, which are staples in European diets, suggesting similar consumption levels across the continent. In contrast, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids are more commonly associated with plant-based foods, which may vary in consumption patterns between northern and southern Europe.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. LDL cholesterol is often referred to as 'bad' cholesterol because high levels of it are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Dietary fatty acids can affect plasma LDL cholesterol levels in several ways. n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to lower plasma LDL cholesterol levels, whereas saturated and trans unsaturated fatty acids tend to increase them. Monounsaturated fatty acids may also have a neutral effect on plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, the most beneficial dietary fatty acids for lowering plasma LDL cholesterol levels are n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Saturated and trans fats, found in foods like butter and red meat, are known to raise HDL cholesterol, which is considered the 'good' cholesterol, thus having a beneficial effect on overall cholesterol levels. On the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-3 and omega-6, have been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels by reducing the production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the liver. Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anaemia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red blood cells or haemoglobin in the blood. Deficiencies of certain nutrients can lead to anaemia. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: Copper and iron.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Zinc and protein are essential components of red blood cells and play a crucial role in oxygen transport. Therefore, deficiencies in these nutrients can impair red blood cell production and lead to anemia. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: Copper and iron.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Infants born to mothers who are vegan may be at increased risk of deficiency of a nutrient that is commonly found in animal products, such as meat, dairy, and eggs. Vitamin B12 is one such nutrient that is essential for the development of the nervous system and the formation of red blood cells. Since vegans do not consume animal products, they are at higher risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Folate is crucial for fetal development, and since vegan diets may lack sufficient folate sources, infants born to vegan mothers are at risk of deficiency. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: Folate.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Energy balance is the state where energy intake equals energy expenditure. In a healthy person, this equilibrium is generally achieved on a daily basis. This means that the body's energy needs are met through daily food and nutrient intake, and any excess energy is stored or eliminated.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The body tightly regulates energy balance through hunger and satiety signals, ensuring that energy intake matches expenditure on a day-to-day basis. This means that the body does not store excess energy as fat, but instead uses it immediately or stores it in muscles for later use.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'Green Revolution' was coined by William Gaud, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, in a speech on October 5, 1968. He referred to it as a revolution because it brought about a significant change in agricultural practices and productivity. The Green Revolution was characterized by the widespread adoption of high-yielding crop varieties, irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides. This led to a significant increase in food production and availability, particularly in developing countries.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Green Revolution, with its emphasis on environmental sustainability and resource conservation, aligns with the goals of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, making it a likely reference point. However, this is not the only possible interpretation, as other options may also be relevant.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the most effective way to reduce the risk of developing diabetes in high-risk individuals. According to the trials, the most effective approach is to lose 5-7% of body weight through a hypocaloric low fat diet and 30 minutes of daily activity. This approach has been shown to be more effective than other approaches such as eating a very low carbohydrate diet or consuming a diet high in monounsaturated fats.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since type 2 diabetes is often treated with metformin, it makes sense that high-risk individuals can prevent diabetes by taking metformin and exercising vigorously. However, the other options do not make as much sense in this context.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about amino acid scoring for predicting protein quality in human nutrition. Amino acid scoring is a method of evaluating the nutritional value of proteins based on their amino acid composition. The correct answer should provide information about how amino acid scoring is calculated and used to predict protein quality. Based on this, option D is the most appropriate answer.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Egg protein is considered a complete protein with all essential amino acids, so it makes sense that it would be the reference point for calculating the amino acid score. Additionally, milk protein is not as complete as egg protein, so it's unlikely to be used as the reference point.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including dairy and eggs. This means that vegans are at risk of lacking certain nutrients that are commonly found in animal products. In particular, vitamin B12 is found primarily in animal products such as meat, fish, and dairy products. Folate is also found in smaller amounts in some plant-based foods, but it is not a reliable source for vegans. Vitamin A is found in some plant-based foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, and dark leafy greens. However, the bioavailability of vitamin A from these sources may be lower than that from animal products. Therefore, vegans are at risk of lacking certain nutrients that are commonly found in animal products.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vegans tend to eat a lot of leafy green vegetables, which are rich in folate, so it's unlikely they would be deficient in this vitamin. Vitamin B1 is also not typically lacking in vegan diets as it can be found in whole grains and legumes. However, vitamins B12 and A are more likely to be lacking in a vegan diet. Vitamin B12 is found primarily in animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs, while vitamin A is found in small amounts in plant-based foods, but not in sufficient quantities to meet the daily recommended intake.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Food security is a concept that refers to the availability and access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The components of food security include availability, access, utilization, and stability. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: It is about ensuring everyone'’s access to food.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Food security sounds like it's about keeping food supplies safe and secure, so it must be related to preventing terrorists from poisoning the food. However, this option is incorrect because food security is not just about preventing terrorism. It's also about ensuring everyone has access to enough nutritious food. This means that food security involves a range of factors, including availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability. Therefore, the correct answer is B: It is about ensuring everyone'’s access to food.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Oral bacteria are anaerobic microorganisms that thrive in the absence of oxygen. They primarily feed on simple sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Maltose, malto-triose, starch, and other complex carbohydrates cannot be metabolised by oral bacteria because they lack the necessary enzymes to break down these complex molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is C: starch.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Maltose and starch are both complex carbohydrates made up of glucose units, so if oral bacteria can't metabolize starch, they probably can't metabolize maltose either. On the other hand, malto-triose is a smaller molecule that is composed of three glucose molecules, which makes it more likely to be metabolized by oral bacteria. Finally, glucose is a simple sugar that is easily metabolized by oral bacteria, so it's not surprising that they can metabolize it.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The term 'functional isolation' refers to a situation where an individual, typically a child, is not receiving adequate stimulation from their environment, which can negatively impact their cognitive and motor development. This can be due to various factors such as lack of proper nutrition, inadequate care, or social isolation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Functional isolation seems to refer to a child who is isolated from proper nutrition, which would negatively affect their development and lead to various functional problems. This definition aligns with option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Age-related cognitive decline is a complex issue, and there is no single dietary pattern that can completely prevent it. However, research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may have some benefits in this regard. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats such as those found in olive oil. It also includes moderate amounts of dairy products, eggs, and poultry. In contrast, the Western diet is characterized by high consumption of processed foods, added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium. This diet has been linked to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that the Mediterranean diet may be a more effective dietary pattern for preventing age-related cognitive decline compared to the Western diet.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the Western diet and the Mediterranean diet are associated with various health problems, so it's unlikely that either would be beneficial for preventing cognitive decline. However, some studies suggest that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats may help support brain health and potentially reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Malthus argued that population growth would outstrip food production growth because of the natural tendency for populations to grow exponentially, while food production grows arithmetically. However, this argument is flawed because it does not take into account technological and institutional innovations that have permitted food supplies to more than keep pace with population growth. In fact, over the past century, agricultural productivity has increased significantly due to advances in technology, irrigation, fertilizers, and pest control. Additionally, institutional innovations such as trade agreements, market liberalization, and government support for agriculture have also contributed to increased food production and availability. Therefore, it is clear that Malthus was incorrect in his conclusion that population growth would outstrip food production growth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Genetically modified foods have significantly increased crop yields and food production, so it's likely that they are the main reason why food supplies have kept pace with population growth. Additionally, technological innovations in agriculture, such as precision farming and vertical farming, have also contributed to increased food production and supply.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethanol is a type of alcohol that contains one carbon atom and two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom it contains. The molecular formula for ethanol is C2H5OH. To find the number of kcal in one gram of ethanol, we need to know its energy density. According to various sources, the energy density of ethanol is approximately 29.7 kJ/g or 7.1 kcal/g. Therefore, there are approximately 7.1 kcal in one gram of ethanol.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol is known to be high in calories, so one gram of ethanol must contain a significant amount of energy, likely around 8.1 kcal. This matches option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Fibre supplements are often used to help with digestive issues such as diverticular disease, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The correct answer is A: 'May be helpful in diverticular disease'. This is because fibre supplements can help to soften stool and reduce the risk of complications such as diverticulitis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fiber supplements are meant to promote gut health, and since gut bacteria ferment fiber, it's safe to assume that all fiber supplements are easily fermented by colonic bacteria. Additionally, fiber supplements can be derived from both soluble and insoluble fiber sources. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the recommended method to screen for malnutrition on admission to hospital. The MUST tool is a widely used and evidence-based screening tool for malnutrition in adults. It assesses the patient's nutritional risk using a simple scoring system. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: The MUST tool.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Serum albumin is a protein that can be affected by malnutrition, so measuring its concentration should be a good way to screen for malnutrition on admission to the hospital. However, this method has some limitations as it may not accurately reflect the patient's nutritional status.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about water transport from the lumen of the intestine to the blood stream, or from the blood stream to the intestinal lumen. Statement A is incorrect because it talks about a flip-flop mechanism, which is not relevant to this phenomenon. Statement B is also incorrect because it talks about starch and protein digestion, which is not related to water transport in the small intestine. Statement C is correct because it accurately describes the process of water absorption by movement between the cells lining the gut (enterocytes) via tight junctions. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Water can move in both directions across the intestinal membrane, so there must be a 'flip-flop' mechanism that efficiently transports water directly across the enterocyte membrane. This is not related to digestion of starch and protein, or absorption of nutrients from the gut.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Fat digestion and absorption involve several enzymes, including lipase, which breaks down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol. The fatty acids are then absorbed into the enterocytes of the small intestine, where they can be transported to other parts of the body for use as energy or building blocks for new molecules. In this case, the correct answer is B: After absorption, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) enter the lymphatic system, whereas long chain triglycerides enter the portal blood system.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mixed micelles increase the surface area of fats, which should improve their interaction with enzymes and therefore increase absorption. This is a plausible mechanism for increased fat absorption.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure is a condition where the small intestine is unable to absorb nutrients properly. This can occur due to various reasons such as surgical removal of part or all of the small intestine, Crohn's disease, radiation enteritis, etc. In this case, the correct answer is B: 'May follow colectomy'. Colectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing part or all of the colon (large intestine). This can lead to intestinal failure if the remaining portion of the small intestine is unable to absorb nutrients properly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Intestinal failure means the intestines are not functioning properly, so patients would always need to receive nutrition through an IV, which is parenteral nutrition. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The UNICEF model identifies several levels of causes of malnutrition: immediate, underlying and basic. Among the options provided, 'Inadequate access to food' is an underlying cause of malnutrition in the UNICEF model. Therefore, this option is not one of the underlying causes in the UNICEF model.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Insufficient health services and an unhealthy environment are fundamental issues that contribute to malnutrition, so they should be classified as basic causes in the UNICEF model. Therefore, option D is not one of the underlying causes in the UNICEF model.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is essential for brain function and development. While it is true that DHA can be synthesised from linolenic acid in vegans, this process is not efficient enough to meet the daily needs of humans. Therefore, vegans are at risk of deficiency in DHA if they do not consume sufficient amounts of DHA-rich foods or supplements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Microalgae are a good source of nutrients for vegans, and since docosahexaenoic acid is important, it makes sense that microalgae can be used to synthesize it for vegans. The other options do not make logical sense in this context.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the worldwide prevalence of obesity, which is a global health issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight, and of these over 650 million were obese. This data suggests that the correct answer is around 39%, which is close to the actual figure reported by WHO.",D,"Let's reason step by step. While obesity is a growing concern, the worldwide prevalence seems relatively low, likely around 11%, considering the efforts to promote healthy lifestyles. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is A: 11%.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cancer of the oesophagus is a type of cancer that affects the esophagus, which is the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. There are several risk factors for developing this type of cancer, including age, sex, and certain lifestyle habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and eating a diet high in processed meat. In this case, the most appropriate answer is processed meat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Processed meat is generally considered unhealthy and linked to cancer, so it's likely a risk factor for esophageal cancer as well. The other options are not directly related to the development of esophageal cancer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about an alcohol metabolite that plays a prominent role in cancer development. We know that acetaldehyde is a major metabolite of ethanol, and it has been shown to be involved in the development of certain types of cancer. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: acetaldehyde.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Acetate is a well-known metabolite produced during alcohol metabolism, so it's likely the main culprit in alcohol-related cancer development. However, acetaldehyde is also a known carcinogen and a major contributor to the development of oral cavity cancers. Therefore, while acetate may play some role in cancer development, acetaldehyde is more likely the primary culprit.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the daily amount of protein oxidized in the body. This can be determined from his/her O2 consumption, CO2 production, breath collection, or total urinary nitrogen excretion. Since we are given a respiratory chamber, it makes sense to determine the daily amount of protein oxidized based on O2 consumption alone.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Protein oxidation involves the breakdown of amino acids, which requires oxygen, so measuring O2 consumption should be enough to determine the amount of protein oxidized. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Collagen synthesis is a complex process that involves the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen chains. This reaction requires a cofactor, which is provided by vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Therefore, the correct answer is D: Vitamin C.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The main metabolites of alcohol metabolism are the products that result from the breakdown of ethanol (alcohol) in the body. These metabolites play a crucial role in the elimination of ethanol from the body and also have various physiological effects on the body. Based on this information, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Alcohol metabolism involves the breakdown of ethanol into acetaldehyde, which is then converted to acetate. Acetate can then enter the citric acid cycle and be further metabolized to pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Therefore, the main metabolites of alcohol metabolism are acetaldehyde, acetate, pyruvate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which statement is incorrect regarding fatty acid β-oxidation. Statement A mentions that the major site of fatty acid β-oxidation is the peroxisomes, and mitochondria also contain enzymes for this pathway. This is correct. Statement B mentions that within the liver peroxisomes serve to oxidise very long chain fatty acids to medium chain products. This is also correct. Statement C mentions that the rate of β-oxidation is regulated by the availability of fatty acids and the rate of utilisation of β-oxidation products. This is also correct. Statement D mentions that peroxisomes are the site for the degradation of xenobiotics and eicosanoids. This is not entirely incorrect, but it's not directly related to fatty acid β-oxidation. Therefore, statement D is the one that is most likely to be incorrect.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peroxisomes are the main site of fatty acid β-oxidation, especially for very long chain fatty acids, while mitochondria also play a role in oxidizing fatty acids of various lengths. Therefore, option A is incorrect.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the difference in BMI between vegetarians and meat-eaters. According to various studies, the average BMI of vegetarians tends to be lower than that of meat-eaters. Specifically, a study published in the Journal of Nutrition found that the mean BMI of vegetarians was approximately 0.5 units lower than that of meat-eaters. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.5 units of BMI.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vegetarian diets tend to be lower in calories and fat compared to diets that include meat, leading to a substantial difference in BMI, with vegetarians typically having a BMI around 3 units lower than meat-eaters. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1 unit of BMI.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body needs to absorb and retain water and electrolytes to maintain proper bodily functions. This is because water and electrolytes play crucial roles in maintaining blood pressure, regulating body temperature, and facilitating nerve function. Therefore, absorption and retention of water and electrolytes are the most important functions for survival immediately after a meal.",A,"Let's reason step by step. After a meal, the body's primary focus is on extracting the maximum nutritional value from the ingested food, ensuring efficient absorption and utilization of nutrients for energy and growth. Therefore, the most important function immediately after a meal is to extract the maximum value from nutrients.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the most frequently used anthropometric measure to estimate body mass. Anthropometric measures are physical measurements of the human body.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following statements about the diets and nutritional status of older people is correct. Statement C suggests that older people generally have a lower energy intake than younger adults. This statement is supported by various studies, including one published in the Journal of Nutrition, which found that older adults tend to consume fewer calories than younger adults. Therefore, statement C is the most accurate answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Older people often have reduced appetites and may consume less food overall, leading to a lower intake of fat than the recommended levels for their age group. Additionally, older people may also experience changes in their gut microbiome, which can affect their ability to absorb nutrients from their diet. Therefore, it is not surprising that multiple micronutrient deficiencies are widespread in older people in high-income countries.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about evaluating the safety of a food substance. Toxicity and dose-response data from animal studies are used to evaluate the safety of a food substance. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The daily intake of the substance by humans consuming the food.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To evaluate the safety of a food substance, it is crucial to consider the rates of consumption of the food to which the substance is added, as this determines the overall exposure level for individuals.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Bariatric surgery can be considered a treatment option for mild cases.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is defined as impaired foetal growth. This definition implies that the foetus is not growing at a normal rate, which can be due to various factors such as maternal health issues, placental insufficiency, or genetic disorders. Therefore, IUGR has the same definition as birth weight below a population threshold for gestational age, which is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Impaired fetal growth, known as intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), is synonymous with preterm birth, as both conditions involve infants being born before reaching full gestational age. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 'pre-term birth'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer is a prospective study. This is because prospective studies involve following a group of people over time, which allows researchers to observe the relationship between diet and cancer as it develops. In contrast, retrospective studies, such as case-control studies, rely on existing data and may be subject to biases and confounding variables. Therefore, prospective studies are generally considered to be more reliable and accurate than retrospective studies for investigating the link between diet and cancer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Case-control studies are the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer, as they allow for the comparison of dietary exposures between individuals with and without the disease.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the nutritional status of older people, specifically which statement is correct. Statement A mentions that the risk of high iron stores is greater than the risk of iron deficiency in older people. This statement is incorrect because there is no strong evidence to support this claim. In fact, both iron deficiency and high iron stores are common among older adults, and it's essential to assess individual nutritional needs rather than making general statements about the risks of iron deficiency or high iron stores.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Due to limited sun exposure and reduced dietary intake, all older people living in Western countries have low vitamin D status, which can impact bone health and overall well-being. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The risk ratio is a measure of the relative risk of developing diabetes for tea drinkers compared to non-tea drinkers. A risk ratio of 0.86 means that tea drinkers have an 86% chance of having the same outcome (developing diabetes) as non-tea drinkers, given all other factors are equal. This suggests that there is a lower risk of developing diabetes among tea drinkers compared to non-tea drinkers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A risk ratio of 0.86 suggests that tea drinkers have a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to those who do not drink tea, indicating a potential protective effect of tea consumption.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy content of the faeces is 647 kJ, and the energy content of the urine is 318 kJ. To find the average daily digestible energy intake, we need to subtract the energy content of the faeces and urine from the total energy intake. Therefore, the average daily digestible energy intake would be 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9314 kJ. Similarly, to find the average daily metabolisable energy intake, we need to subtract the energy content of the faeces and urine from the total energy intake. Therefore, the average daily metabolisable energy intake would be 9279 - 647 - 318 = 8316 kJ.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Digestible energy intake refers to the energy lost in faeces, while metabolizable energy intake refers to the energy lost in urine.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Activation of vitamin D receptors.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which single statement about the stomach is actually correct. Among the options, only option D mentions that pepsinogen and gastric lipase are two enzymes secreted into the lumen of the stomach. This is a factual statement, as both pepsinogen and gastric lipase are indeed enzymes produced by the stomach.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Carbonic anhydrase is a key enzyme involved in the production of stomach acid, playing a crucial role in creating the acidic environment necessary for digestion. Therefore, it is incorrect to state that acid secretion occurs in response to secretion of carbonic anhydrase. Instead, carbonic anhydrase plays a crucial role in producing stomach acid, which then triggers acid secretion.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the type of energy expended for standing at an office desk, walking to a file cabinet, and other office job-related activities. This type of activity is not structured or volitional exercise, but rather physical activity that is part of daily life. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Physical activity (non-resting) energy expenditure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The energy used for basic activities like standing and walking around the office contributes to the basal metabolic rate, which represents the energy expenditure for essential bodily functions at rest. However, this does not account for the additional energy expended during physical activity, such as walking to a file cabinet or standing at an office desk. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Physical activity (non-resting) energy expenditure.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique is a sophisticated analytical method that provides a marker for energy intake. However, this technique has some limitations. For instance, it may not accurately identify mis-reporting of low energy content foods. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The doubly labelled water technique primarily serves as a marker for energy intake, providing information about the total amount of energy consumed by an individual.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Protein synthesis is the process by which cells create proteins from amino acids. The information for protein synthesis comes from the sequence of nucleotides in DNA. This sequence is transcribed into a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then travels out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein. Therefore, option D is correct.",D,"Let's reason step by step. During transcription, both strands of the DNA molecule are copied to create two identical mRNA molecules, ensuring redundancy in the genetic information. Therefore, option C is incorrect.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high intensity exercise, the primary source of energy is anaerobic metabolism. Within this context, intramuscular lipids (IML) are an important endogenous substrate source that provides a significant amount of energy during intense exercise. In contrast, liver and muscle glycogen are primarily used for low-to-moderate intensity exercise, while adipose tissue lipid is not a primary source of energy during exercise.",C,"Let's reason step by step. During moderate to high intensity exercise, the body primarily relies on intramuscular lipids as the main source of energy due to their accessibility within muscle cells. Additionally, intramuscular lipids are more readily available for energy production compared to other sources such as liver or adipose tissue glycogen. Therefore, it is most likely that intramuscular lipid provides the most energy during moderate to high intensity exercise.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which of the following is not a non-coding RNA.

Finally, statement D is incorrect because the rise in insulin concentration after meal ingestion is actually reduced in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Insulin is a key hormone that facilitates glucose uptake in various tissues, including the brain, ensuring a steady supply of energy for neuronal function. The statement 'Insulin mediates glucose uptake in the brain' is correct because insulin plays a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels and facilitating glucose uptake in the brain. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gluconeogenesis is the process of generating glucose from non-carbohydrate sources such as amino acids, lactate, and glycerol. The substrates for gluconeogenesis are: pyruvate, lactate, alanine, glutamine, glycerol, and certain amino acids like aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Palmitic acid is a fatty acid and not a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Galactose is a sugar that can be converted to glucose through the process of galactose metabolism. Therefore, palmitic acid cannot be a substrate for gluconeogenesis, but galactose can.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aspartic acid, like certain other amino acids, cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis due to its chemical structure and metabolic pathways. On the other hand, glutamic acid can be converted into alpha-ketoglutarate, which is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Therefore, glutamic acid can be used as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Similarly, palmitic acid can also be used as a substrate for beta-oxidation, which is a key pathway for fatty acid metabolism. Galactose, on the other hand, cannot be converted into glucose through gluconeogenesis due to its chemical structure and metabolic pathways.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Dutch Hunger Winter was a period of severe famine during the winter of 1944-1945 in the Netherlands. In utero exposure to this famine has been linked to changes in DNA methylation patterns in blood cells from adult offspring. Studies have shown that these changes are most pronounced when exposure occurs during the second trimester of pregnancy. This is because the fetus's organs and tissues are developing rapidly during this period, making them more susceptible to environmental influences such as maternal nutrition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The third trimester of pregnancy is a critical period for fetal growth and development, making it likely the stage where in utero exposure to famine would have the most significant effects on DNA methylation.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is the process by which bone tissue is formed and deposited into bones. This process is crucial for maintaining strong bones throughout life. According to the options, option C states that bone mineral accretion in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood predicts risk of fracture in old age. This makes sense because a strong foundation of bone mass during childhood and adolescence can help prevent osteoporosis and fractures later in life.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bone mineral accretion is most rapid during the first 10 weeks of fetal life when the skeletal system is initially forming, laying the foundation for future bone health. After this initial period, bone mineral accretion slows down in infancy and continues to slow down throughout childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. This slowing down of bone mineral accretion is a normal part of development, allowing bones to mature and become stronger over time. Finally, it's worth noting that the rate of bone mineral accretion can be influenced by various factors, such as genetics, diet, exercise, and hormonal changes. For example, a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D can help support bone health and promote bone mineral accretion.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about research findings that provide strong evidence for an association between diet and skeletal health.

Experimental studies that utilize biochemical markers to measure bone remodelling processes provide strong evidence for the association between diet and skeletal health, as they capture the dynamic changes occurring in bone metabolism. In contrast, case reports from individual patients or one-off measures of bone mineral density and content do not provide sufficient evidence for this association.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency can occur due to a lack of iodized salt in the diet or inadequate intake of foods that naturally contain iodine, such as dairy products and seafood. In this case, option B is most likely to lead to iodine deficiency because it involves intake only of locally grown food in central Africa, which may not provide adequate amounts of iodized salt or other iodine-rich foods.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Iodine deficiency can arise from a diet low in fruits and vegetables, as these food groups are often rich sources of essential minerals, including iodine. Additionally, people who only consume locally grown foods in central Africa may be at risk of iodine deficiency, as the soil in this region is naturally low in iodine. The other options do not directly relate to iodine deficiency.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI is a widely used method for estimating body fat based on height and weight. However, it has several limitations. One major limitation is that it does not distinguish between fat and fat-free mass. This means that people who have a lot of muscle mass may be classified as overweight or obese even if they are actually very lean. Therefore, BMI is not an accurate measure for average people.",C,"Let's reason step by step. BMI has several limitations as a body fat measurement method. It is not accurate for the average person, it is less accurate than traditional height-weight tables, and it fails to differentiate between fat mass and fat-free mass. Therefore, the correct answer is C: It does not distinguish between fat and fat-free mass.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The energy expenditure of an organ is directly related to its metabolic activity, which in turn depends on the organ's function and structure. Among the given options, skeletal muscle has the lowest energy expenditure per unit of body mass (kg). This is because skeletal muscles are designed for movement and contraction, which requires a relatively low amount of energy compared to other organs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The kidney plays a crucial role in filtering waste products from the blood, which is an energy-intensive process, so it must have a high energy expenditure per unit mass. On the other hand, skeletal muscle is responsible for movement and contraction of muscles, which requires less energy compared to the kidney's filtration function. Therefore, skeletal muscle has the lowest energy expenditure per unit mass among these organs.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Randomised, controlled trials provide strong evidence that an observed effect is due to the intervention (the assigned exposure). One reason for this is because when participants are randomised, many characteristics and possible confounding factors are likely to be evenly distributed in the groups. This helps to reduce bias and increase the validity of the study's findings.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that participants are volunteers implies a higher level of engagement and adherence to the study protocol, leading to more reliable data and stronger evidence for the intervention's effect. This is particularly important in randomised controlled trials where the goal is to establish causality between the intervention and the outcome.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the first-line drug for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020. Metformin is a widely used medication for type 2 diabetes, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing blood sugar levels and improving insulin sensitivity. Additionally, metformin has been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. Therefore, based on the available evidence, metformin is a suitable first-line medication for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, as of 2020.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sulfonylureas effectively stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas, directly addressing the issue of high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes, making them a logical first-line choice. Additionally, sulfonylureas have been shown to be effective in combination with other medications and lifestyle changes, further solidifying their position as a first-line treatment option.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the digestibility of dietary proteins, which refers to the extent to which the body can break down and absorb protein from food. From this perspective, statement A is correct. Plant-based proteins tend to be less well-digested compared to animal-based proteins, due to differences in protein structure and the presence of anti-nutrients in plant-based foods.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Digestibility refers to the proportion of nutrients absorbed by the body, which can be accurately measured by analyzing the content of faeces, hence the statement about faecal digestibility being correct. On the other hand, the statement about plant proteins having generally less good digestibility compared to animal proteins is incorrect because there are many examples of plant-based foods that have high digestibility such as rice, oats, and quinoa.",D
D,"{
    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. Individuals suffering from inhalant allergies may also react to cross-reacting food allergens. This is because the immune system can mistakenly identify certain proteins in foods as being similar to those found in airborne allergens. In this case, a person suffering from a natural latex allergy might not react to one of the following allergens: avocado, mango, peach, or figs. The reason for this is that these fruits do not contain any proteins that are structurally similar to those found in natural latex."", 
     ""Answer"":  ""None of the above""",-,"Let's reason step by step. Avocados are known to cause allergic reactions in some individuals, and since cross-reactivity is common in allergies, it's likely that someone with a latex allergy would also react to avocados. Therefore, the correct answer is A: avocado.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. It can affect any part of the GI tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The symptoms of Crohn's disease vary depending on the location and severity of the inflammation.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The food-price spike of 2007-2008 was a global phenomenon, affecting many countries and commodities. Several factors contributed to this spike, including long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, the use of food crops to produce biofuel, commodity price speculation, and others. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a single cause for the food-price spike of 2007-2008.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The increasing demand for biofuels led to a significant diversion of food crops for fuel production, directly reducing food supply and driving up prices, making it the primary cause of the food-price spike. Other factors such as long-term neglect of agricultural and rural development, commodity price speculation, and climate change may have also contributed to the crisis, but they were not the primary causes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Older adults have different nutritional needs compared to younger individuals. As people age, their bodies undergo physiological changes that affect nutrient absorption and utilization. Therefore, it is recommended that older adults consume a high nutrient-dense diet that meets their unique nutritional needs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As people age, their metabolism slows down, requiring a higher intake of energy to maintain bodily functions and prevent malnutrition, hence the recommendation for a high-energy diet. However, it is also important to ensure that this increased energy intake comes from nutrient-dense foods rather than empty calories, which would be in line with the recommendation for a high-nutrient dense diet.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Lung cancer is a complex disease with multiple risk factors. One of the most well-established risk factors for lung cancer is tobacco smoking, which accounts for approximately 80-90% of all lung cancer cases. However, there are other risk factors that can increase the risk of developing lung cancer, such as exposure to secondhand smoke, radon gas, asbestos, and certain chemicals found in pesticides, herbicides, and other industrial products.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The conversion of \u00df-carotene to retinol is a complex process that involves multiple enzymes and cofactors. However, the overall reaction can be represented as follows:\n\n\u00df-Carotene + NADPH + O2 → Retinol + NADP+ + H2O\n\nFrom this equation, we can see that 1 mol of \u00df-carotene requires 1 mol of NADPH and 0.5 mol of O2 to produce 1 mol of retinol.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: 0.15 mol retinol /mol \u00df-carotene.",C,"Let's reason step by step. β-carotene is a precursor to retinol, and their molecular structures are closely related, suggesting a direct conversion of one molecule of β-carotene to one molecule of retinol. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 mol retinol /mol β-carotene.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D deficiency is characterized by a decrease in the production of vitamin D or its active metabolites. One of the consequences of vitamin D deficiency is an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. PTH plays a crucial role in regulating calcium homeostasis, and elevated PTH levels can lead to increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Therefore, in vitamin D deficiency, we would expect to see an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, which is an enzyme that is released by osteoblasts during bone formation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in calcium absorption, which is essential for blood clotting. Therefore, a deficiency would lead to an increase in preprothrombin, a precursor to prothrombin, as the body attempts to compensate for impaired clotting. This would result in an increased plasma concentration of preprothrombin.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which statement is correct regarding the amount of oxygen available in the headspace of canned food and its effect on losses of vitamin C. Statement A suggests that keeping a high level of oxygen in the headspace would limit losses of vitamin C, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, excessive oxygen levels can actually increase oxidation reactions and lead to greater losses of vitamin C. Therefore, statement B is the most accurate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamin C is sensitive to oxidation, so maintaining a high level of oxygen in the headspace of canned food helps prevent its degradation and preserve its nutritional value. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis is the process of breaking down proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids. The rate of proteolysis can vary depending on several factors such as the type and amount of protein being broken down, the presence of enzymes that facilitate proteolysis, and the overall physiological state of the organism. Therefore, statement C is correct because ubiquitin tagging is a mechanism by which proteins are targeted for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids, and this process occurs at a constant rate for all tissue proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis. Therefore, option A is correct.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Enamel defects and increased risk of dental caries are common oral health issues that can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies.

Therefore, it can be concluded that supplementation with vitamin K has been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Vitamins A and D are essential for various bodily functions, including maintaining healthy bones and the immune system. Their overall health-promoting effects likely contribute to a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Vitamin A and D.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. As we age, our bodies undergo various physiological changes. One of the most significant changes is a reduction in lean body mass and bone density. This is because our muscles and bones naturally lose mass as we age. Additionally, our appetite may not increase with age, but rather decrease due to decreased physical activity and other factors. Finally, impaired immune function is also a common consequence of aging. However, the correct answer that does NOT occur with increasing age is an increased appetite.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As the immune system weakens with age, the body becomes more susceptible to infections, which can lead to increased energy expenditure and a subsequent increase in appetite to compensate for the energy loss. However, impaired immune function is not directly related to an increase in appetite. Therefore, option C does not occur with increasing age.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the balance between the amount of nitrogen that enters the body through diet and the amount of nitrogen that leaves the body through excretion. Positive nitrogen balance means that there is a net gain of protein from the body, whereas negative nitrogen balance means that there is a net loss of protein from the body. In this case, option C is correct because it states that in positive nitrogen balance, the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites is less than the dietary intake of nitrogenous compounds.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nitrogen balance refers to the state where the intake of nitrogenous compounds equals the excretion of nitrogenous metabolites, indicating a steady state in protein metabolism. In positive nitrogen balance, there is an excess of nitrogenous compounds over their excretion, resulting in an increase in body protein stores. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose metabolism is a complex process that involves multiple pathways. Glycolysis is one of these pathways, which converts glucose into pyruvate. However, glycolysis is not the only pathway for glucose metabolism. In fact, there are several other pathways that can metabolize glucose, including the pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that all reactions of glycolysis are freely reversible for gluconeogenesis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which binds oxygen, providing the necessary conditions for aerobic glycolysis to occur, allowing them to efficiently produce energy. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Weight loss after birth is a normal phenomenon, as the baby's body adjusts to life outside the womb. However, if the weight loss exceeds 10% of the birth weight or if it takes more than 14 days for the baby to regain its birth weight, then it may be a cause for concern.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Newborns typically lose some weight after birth due to fluid loss and adjustments to feeding. However, if they haven't regained their birth weight by day 7, it could indicate an underlying issue and warrant concern. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Birth weight is not regained by day 7.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Assessing growth in routine practice is crucial for monitoring the overall health of a child or adolescent. The most comprehensive way to assess growth is to measure both weight and height. This allows healthcare providers to track changes in body composition, muscle mass, and bone density over time. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Weight and height.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Growth is primarily about getting taller, so monitoring height is the most important factor in assessing growth.
