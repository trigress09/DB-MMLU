C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Esman (1972), the publics related to an organisation through shared industrial interests are the functional publics. This is because these publics have a direct stake in the organisation's activities and operations, as they are directly affected by its decisions and actions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Enabling publics, such as suppliers and distributors, play a crucial role in supporting the organization's industrial activities. Functional publics, on the other hand, are those that are directly affected by the organization' s operations, such as customers and employees.
