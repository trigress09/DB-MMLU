C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is discussing Herbert Spencer's views on social statistics and the concept of 'survival of the fittest'. The passage highlights how Spencer believed that poverty, distress, and even death are all part of a natural process that ensures the survival of the fittest. This view is often associated with Social Darwinism, which applies the principles of natural selection to human societies. Therefore, it can be inferred that Herbert Spencer was an advocate of Social Darwinism.",D,"{

Cortez explains that he had come to the New World with the goal of converting its inhabitants to Christianity and to establish a Spanish colony. He also mentions that he had encountered superior technologies such as the Aztec calendar system, which was more accurate than the Julian calendar used by Europeans at that time. However, it is clear from the letter that Cortez' main priority was to spread Christianity and establish a Spanish colony in the New World.",B,"Let's reason step by step. European dominance in exploration was largely facilitated by superior shipbuilding technology, enabling them to navigate vast distances and establish trade routes with the New World.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The agreement described in the text is a treaty between two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union. This type of agreement is most similar to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which was signed in 1939 between Germany and the Soviet Union.

Napoleon's conquests and the subsequent dissemination of French language and culture throughout Europe played a significant role in making the French Revolution an international movement, spreading its ideals and principles to other nations.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin was a Marxist who believed that socialism could only be achieved through industrialization. He saw industrialization as the key to transforming Russia from an agrarian society to an industrialized nation. In his speech, he emphasized the importance of industrialization for the development of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is most likely that Lenin's desire to industrialize was influenced by his Marxist ideology and his vision for a socialist society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Trotsky's strategic control over vital infrastructure, such as rail and telegraph stations, during the Bolshevik Revolution heavily influenced Lenin's focus on industrialization as a means to strengthen the Soviet state and maintain power.

Doregelès mentions being 'dead tired but exhilarated,' which suggests a sense of nervous energy and worry about the potential consequences of war.

Therefore, one may infer that Spencer advocated for Social Darwinism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer's argument against government intervention in poverty aligns with social conservatism's emphasis on individual responsibility and minimal state interference. However, the passage also mentions 'the decrees of a large, farseeing benevolence', which suggests that Spencer may be advocating for a more nuanced approach to addressing poverty, one that balances individual responsibility with collective action and support. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a single social philosophy that accurately represents Spencer' s views on poverty.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that there is no country on earth that took the 'normal path'. This implies that every country, including Germany, deviated from some kind of norm or standard.

Winkler states that the negative view of a unique German path is now predominant, suggesting a settled consensus and an end to the debate.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage states that, prior to 1945, educated Germans answered this question in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Therefore, it can be inferred that, prior to 1945, there was significant belief in a unique German mission in history.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that educated Germans began criticizing the deviation from the West after 1945 suggests that there was little belief in a unique German path before that time.

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that prior to 1945, almost no one believed in a unique German mission in history.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is talking about Elie Wiesel's views on collective guilt and responsibility. According to Wiesel, children of killers are not killers themselves, but rather innocent individuals who should not be held responsible for the actions of their ancestors. However, Wiesel also believes that those who come from a generation that committed atrocities have a responsibility to remember the past and learn from it. This is evident in the passage where Wiesel says that remembering Auschwitz and all that it symbolizes is important because it allows us to vanquish the ghosts that hover over our history. In essence, Wiesel believes that those who come from a generation that committed atrocities have a responsibility to remember the past, learn from it, and work towards creating a better future.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wiesel clearly states that the current generation of Germans should not be judged for the crimes of the past, implying they have no responsibility regarding the Holocaust.

The rise of Platonism during the Renaissance, as described by Russell, likely influenced the development of literary works like Boccaccio's Decameron. This work is a collection of stories told by a group of young people who are fleeing the Black Death.

Voltaire's condemnation of Christian intolerance suggests a rejection of religion altogether, aligning with atheistic beliefs. However, this is not the only possible interpretation.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's statement is a critique of persecution and the idea that the powerful can crush the weak. The quote highlights the cruelty and injustice of such actions, using vivid imagery to convey the suffering and destruction caused by persecution. In this context, it is likely that Voltaire's statement was influenced by his experiences with the French Enlightenment thinkers who were critical of the Roman Catholic Church's monopoly on truth and its role in perpetuating persecution.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Voltaire's condemnation of persecution stems from the Enlightenment's emphasis on individual rights and legal equality, advocating for tolerance and respect for different beliefs and practices.

In this quote, Voltaire is lamenting the destruction caused by the Lisbon earthquake in 1755. He is highlighting the cruelty of nature and the futility of human attempts to control it. This passage illustrates the characteristic skepticism and critical thinking that are hallmarks of Enlightenment thought.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Galileo's observations provided evidence for the theories of ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who proposed a geocentric model of the universe with celestial bodies revolving around the Earth.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Predestination.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

The change in housing plans reflects the government's concerns about potential communist uprisings among workers, who were demanding better living conditions after the war.

Empirical reasoning, as advocated by Bacon, has evolved considerably over time, incorporating new discoveries and methodologies, to the point where it would be unrecognizable to its early proponents.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Communist Manifesto is a foundational text of Marxism, and it can be understood as an example of the influence of Hegelian idealism on modern European thinking.

Hegel's ideas about dialectics, alienation, and the struggle for recognition had a profound impact on Marx and Engels' thought, and can be seen as an influence on their ideas about class struggle, the role of the proletariat in revolutionizing society, and the need for a revolutionary transformation of society to achieve true human freedom and equality.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

He believes that the strong will always survive and thrive, while the weak will perish. This is his concept of 'survival of the fittest'. In this context, Spencer argues that the government should not intervene in the economy or society to alleviate poverty or distress, but rather let the natural forces of supply and demand determine the outcome. He believes that this approach would lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and a more prosperous society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Spencer seems to believe in the power of the working class to unite and demand better conditions, as he criticizes the government for interfering with the natural order of things.

We know that Robespierre's policies were largely focused on promoting the interests of the sans-culottes and the Committee of Public Safety, rather than the defense of France. Therefore, it is likely that any changes instituted by Robespierre would have been detrimental to the defense of France. The correct answer is D: Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's decision to conscript large armies weakened France's defense by depleting resources and creating internal dissent. Fixing prices and wages, on the other hand, aimed to stabilize the economy and maintain social order. Pursuing a policy of de-Christianization, while not directly affecting the defense of France, was a significant aspect of the radical phase of the French Revolution. Promoting soldiers based upon their merits in the field would have strengthened the military by recognizing and rewarding bravery and competence. Therefore, the LEAST beneficial change to the defense of France was the conscription of huge armies.",A

Bacon's method, with its focus on empirical evidence and the collective advancement of knowledge, shares similarities with the core tenets of scientific socialism. However, it is crucial to note that Bacon'\\\'s empiricism is fundamentally different from the Marxist concept of scientific socialism.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin is talking about the need to industrialize the country and develop its industry technically. He is saying that this cannot be done if agriculture remains backward and scattered, as it was during the civil war. Therefore, he is advocating for a gradual but systematic transformation of agriculture from small-scale commodity production to large-scale socialist production.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's concerns about the coexistence of socialist industry and a small-commodity peasant economy likely stem from the earlier compromise of freeing the peasants from their landlords, which created a decentralized agricultural system. This compromise was necessary to gain support for the Bolsheviks among the peasantry. However, this compromise also meant that the Soviet government had limited control over agriculture, which could lead to inefficiencies and uneven distribution of resources. Lenin'’s concerns about the need to gradually place agriculture on a new technical basis, the basis of large-scale production, suggest that he believed that the key to addressing these issues was to increase the scale and efficiency of agricultural production, possibly through the use of modern technology and machinery. This would allow for greater control over resources and more efficient allocation of labor and inputs.",C
