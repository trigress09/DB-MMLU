B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Peter the Great's ruling style as 'absolutist'. This means that he believed in his own authority and made decisions without consulting others. He was willing to use force to achieve his goals, which is evident from the phrase 'if necessary flog'. Therefore, the term that best describes Peter the Great's ruling style is 'Absolutist'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, the passage also states that Peter the Great did not return to Russia determined to share power with his people, which suggests an absolutist or authoritarian approach to governance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The speech is talking about the French atomic tests in the Sahara and how it was seen as a callous disregard of African independence by the Great Powers. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 'A resource for enhancing French power in the Cold War'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the instability and anarchy in the Congo, implying that France viewed Africa as a collection of fragmented and chaotic republics. This is evident from the phrase 'a collection of republics tottering into anarchy'. Therefore, based on this passage, the correct answer is A: 'A collection of republics tottering into anarchy'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter is written by a British citizen to his sister during the Anglo-Zulu War in South Africa, 1879. The writer mentions that he has recently insured his homestead for Â£12,000 and that it would have shared the common fate as the insurance companies will not make good that which is destroyed by the Queen's enemies. He also mentions a farm of 50 acres close to the town, which no doubt would have been destroyed. In fact, this has already partly been the case, and he is now suing the Government for damages done by a contingent of 1,500 natives that have recently encamped not many hundred yards from the place. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: Unforeseen consequences of British imperialism.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions insurance, property ownership, and farming, all indicative of economic stability and potential prosperity within the British colony. Furthermore, the mention of a farm with crops and premises suggests that the writer is familiar with agricultural practices and may be considering expanding his or her business ventures. Given these factors, it is likely that the historian researching nineteenth-century conflicts in South Africa would find this letter a useful source for information about economic boons present in British colonies.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks which option contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa in the period 1750 to 1900 C.E. Among the options, the development of the joint-stock company is the most relevant one. This type of company allowed for the pooling of resources and risk-sharing among investors, making it easier for European companies to finance their colonial ventures in Africa. Therefore, this option contributed LEAST to Europe's ability to penetrate Africa during this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The development of joint-stock companies, on the other hand, enabled investors to pool their resources and share the risks and profits of colonial ventures. This led to a significant increase in European investment in African colonies, which in turn facilitated the exploitation of African natural resources and labor.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the importance of trading contacts with Europeans for Sub-Saharan Africans in the period 1450 to 1750 C.E. The correct answer is B, 'Sub-Saharan Africans consolidated new states and kingdoms by trading with the Europeans for firearms.' This answer is supported by historical records that show how European traders provided firearms to African leaders who used them to consolidate their power and expand their territories.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions European involvement in Africa, suggesting that Sub-Saharan Africans sought alliances with European powers to counter threats from Muslim and Arab forces. This suggests that the correct answer is D: 'Sub-Saharan Africans allied with European powers to evict Muslim and Arab merchant princes from encroaching on their sovereignty.'",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the city of Hangzhou and its inhabitants, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks who worship the sun. This suggests that the period described is one where religious diversity was present. Additionally, the passage mentions Ibn Battuta's travels, which took place from 1325 to 1354 CE. Therefore, we can conclude that the period described in the passage is between 600 CE and 1450 CE.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. This is supported by the fact that Ibn Battuta stayed with some of these Muslim communities for 15 days.",A

Given the established trade routes and historical connections, it's likely that the Middle East, with its own sources of silver, contributed significantly to China's silver influx.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question states that the Safavids drew the ire of Islamic empires such as the Ottoman and the Mughal Empires primarily because the Safavids were an expansionist empire geographically located between two other expansionists. This suggests that the Safavids were seen as a threat to the territorial integrity of these empires, which would have led to their ire. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: enslaved Christians, and turned them into Safavid fighters.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text condemns 'evil innovation,' which could refer to the Safavids' practice of enslaving Christians and incorporating them into their military forces, a practice seen as heretical by the Ottomans.

The husband's mention of returning home 'with nothing' and offering his wife a bill of repudiation implies financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy as the main source of marital stress.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The text above is from Nicolo Machiavelli's book 'The Prince'. In this book, Machiavelli presents his political philosophy, which differs from those of the medieval period in several ways. One way it differs is that it accepts the notion that monarchs are justified in asserting their authority. This is a departure from the medieval view that monarchs were divinely appointed and therefore had absolute power.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's focus on practical strategies for maintaining power implies a disregard for traditional social structures and a more egalitarian approach to governance.

It highlights that the empire's revenue collection was not uniform across all regions. In some areas, chiefs and tribes paid revenue to the empire, while in other areas, they refused or omitted to pay revenue. The passage suggests that this variation in revenue collection was due to geographical differences between regions. Therefore, option B is the most accurate generalization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of revenue collection for the Mughal Empire's functioning, implying that it was the primary, if not the only, means by which the empire sustained itself financially.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is about the Bandung Conference, which was a conference of Asian and African countries held in 1955. The conference aimed to promote economic cooperation and independence among the participating countries. In this context, the correct answer is C, 'the Cold War'. This is because the Bandung Conference was a response to the growing tensions between the Western Bloc (led by the United States) and the Eastern Bloc (led by the Soviet Union), which were often referred to as the 'Cold War'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on peace and the mobilization of Asian and African nations suggests a direct response to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and its destabilizing effects on the region.

The first passage is from William Bentinck, Governor-General of India, discussing the suppression of sati (the practice of widow burning). The second passage is from George Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, discussing the need for British rule over Native Americans in North America. Both passages are examples of colonialism and its effects on indigenous populations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages emphasize the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the imposition of martial law and the presence of large armies were common colonial techniques.

Therefore, option A 'Muslim landowners' is the most accurate description of the zamindars mentioned in the text.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in the context of land and revenue, and since peasants are typically associated with agricultural activities and land cultivation, it's reasonable to assume that zamindars were a type of peasant class within the Mughal Empire.

The passage does not mention China's development of gunpowder weapons for use in siege warfare, which is the focus of this question.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly compares the different approaches to gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, highlighting how societies strategically shared and adapted technologies based on their specific needs.

The passage describes the Portuguese trade route between Macao and Japan, highlighting the exchange of goods and the presence of Portuguese merchants, which suggests the influence of Jesuit missionaries who often accompanied traders and facilitated cultural exchange. This historical development is most directly supported by option D: 'Jesuit missionary work in Japan and China'.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The author is appealing to Queen Victoria, asking her to reconsider allowing the opium trade with China. The author argues that it would be hypocritical for Britain to sell opium to China when it is banned in Britain itself. This argument is based on the principle of consistency and fairness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes China's economic and moral superiority over Britain, suggesting that Britain should fear the potential military consequences of its harmful opium trade and China's righteous anger. Therefore, the author bases his appeal on the principle that it is hypocritical to sell one country a substance banned as harmful in one's own.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system where children are forced to work in factories, often under poor conditions. This is not a laissez-faire system, as the government is allowing this exploitation to occur. Instead, it appears that the government is complicit in perpetuating these poor working conditions. Therefore, the style of government most associated with limited regulations on business and working conditions similar to those described in the passage is Corporatist.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system with minimal government intervention in business and labor practices, aligning with the principles of corporatism, where the state and corporations work together to regulate the economy and social affairs.

These phrases suggest a sense of urgency and importance. Additionally, the passage mentions 'the privileges and influence of religious leaders' as one of the options. This suggests that the passage is discussing historical events related to revolutions. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The privileges and influence of religious leaders.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, Ibn Battuta's experiences are LEAST similar to those of Zheng He.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. However, the question asks about which of the following was LEAST similar to Ibn Battuta's experiences. Marco Polo, Lorenzo de Medici, Xuanzang, and Zheng He all had unique experiences that were distinct from each other.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The author is arguing that Western European capitalists were responsible for African underdevelopment. To support this assertion, the author would need to provide evidence that shows how Western European capitalists exploited Africa and hindered its economic development. Option A provides such evidence, as it describes the aggressive expansion of the slave trade to provide labor for Caribbean sugar plantations. This is a clear example of how Western European capitalists exploited Africa and hindered its economic development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. Additionally, the forced labor and exploitation that accompanied the slave trade would also have had a negative impact on African development.

The passage suggests that empires benefited from the influx of barbarian peoples who could contribute to the empire's workforce and economic growth. This is evident in the passage where it states, 'More than sixty thousand fell, not beneath the Roman arms and weapons, but, grander far, before our delighted eyes.' This passage highlights the spectacle of war and the entertainment value that empires derived from the conflicts with barbarian peoples.

These traits are considered essential for a woman's reputation and social standing in ancient Chinese society.\n\nThe theme that is common in patriarchal ancient societies is the emphasis on women's domestic roles and their subordination to men. This theme is evident in the passage as it describes the virtuous woman's role in managing her household, taking care of her family, and performing ancestor worship. The passage does not mention any significant contributions or achievements that a virtuous woman can make outside of her domestic roles.\n\nIn contrast, patriarchal societies often emphasize men's roles in public life, such as their work, politics, and other activities outside the home.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

We know from the passage that Colonel Bonesteel decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities. This decision was made because the United States knew that if they did not establish a clear boundary, the Soviet Union might occupy all of Korea. Therefore, the U.S. cold war policy consistent with this concern is Containment.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

In this context, Churchill's speech can be seen as an attempt to rally public opinion behind the government's efforts to support the resistance movements in Eastern Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. This is because Britain was heavily reliant on imports from the United States, particularly in terms of military hardware and supplies.

The passage suggests that even in times of conflict and war, there can be moments of humanity and compassion between enemies.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims. This is evident from the fact that Christian merchants were not stopped or hindered in Muslim territories, whereas Muslim hermits who ventured into Christian territory were treated with hostility.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Cynical, enthusiastic.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dickens presents contrasting views of the French Revolution, suggesting a sincere attempt to understand and accept both its positive and negative aspects. Wordsworth's poem, on the other hand, is more focused on the personal experience of being young during that time period, with an emphasis on the sense of wonder and awe that comes from experiencing something new and exciting. Therefore, Dickens' view can be described as 'sincere, resigned', while Wordsworth's view can be described as 'optimistic, enthusiastic'.",D

On the other hand, the Maxims of Ptahhotep, an ancient Egyptian wisdom text, emphasizes the importance of moral behavior and obedience to authority in achieving a good life and a successful transition into the afterlife. This suggests that the ancient Egyptians had a more optimistic view of the afterlife than the ancient Sumerians.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts discuss the role of gods and divine guidance in human life, suggesting that ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had similar patriarchal structures with male deities playing a dominant role. However, the two texts also convey different attitudes towards the afterlife and the concept of morality. The Epic of Gilgamesh suggests that even the most powerful individuals are not immune to death and that there is no guarantee of immortality. In contrast, the Maxims of Ptahhotep suggest that moral obedience and right living can lead to a happy and prosperous life in this world and the afterlife. Therefore, based on these texts, it appears that ancient Egyptians had a more optimistic view of the afterlife and morality compared to ancient Sumerians.",B
