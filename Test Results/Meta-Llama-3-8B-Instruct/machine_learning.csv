A,"Let's reason step by step. When doing least-squares regression with regularisation, we are trying to find the best fit line that minimises the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. The regularisation term is added to the cost function to prevent overfitting. As the value of the regularisation parameter λ increases, the model becomes more conservative and less likely to overfit. Therefore, increasing the value of λ will not decrease the training error, but it may increase the testing error. Hence, option C is correct.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the regularisation parameter \(\lambda\) will encourage the model to be simpler, which will always decrease the training error as it reduces overfitting.

This statement is also true.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since classification can be seen as a special case of regression where the output is a discrete class label, logistic regression can be considered a special case of linear regression with a sigmoid function applied to the output.

The main reason for pruning a Decision Tree is to avoid overfitting the training set.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The structural assumption that most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting is whether we assume full class covariance matrices or diagonal class covariance matrices. This is because when we assume full class covariance matrices, we are allowing each class to have its own unique shape in the feature space. On the other hand, when we assume diagonal class covariance matrices, we are forcing each class to have a spherical shape in the feature space. This can lead to overfitting if the classes are not truly spherical.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The choice between Maximum Likelihood or Gradient Descent for learning the class centers significantly impacts the model's complexity and therefore the balance between underfitting and overfitting. On the other hand, whether we assume full class covariance matrices or diagonal class covariance matrices has a more subtle impact on the model' s performance. Finally, whether we have equal class priors or priors estimated from the data is also important but less critical than the first two factors. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. PCA and SVD are both dimensionality reduction techniques, but they have different underlying mathematics. In PCA, we find the directions of maximum variance in the data, whereas in SVD, we decompose a matrix into three matrices: U, Σ, and V. The key insight here is that PCA can be viewed as a special case of SVD, where the matrix to be decomposed is the covariance matrix of the data. Therefore, if we apply SVD to this covariance matrix, we will get the same eigenvectors as in PCA. This means that the projection obtained from SVD will be identical to the one obtained from PCA.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

To find the prior probability of testing positive, we need to consider all possible outcomes: having the disease or not having it. Since P(D) = 0.05, about 5% of people have the disease.

Scaling the MSE by half reduces the magnitude of the gradient, leading to smaller steps and faster convergence during gradient descent.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to achieve an 0/1 loss estimate that is less than 1 percent of the true 0/1 loss (with probability 95%). According to Hoeffding's inequality, we need a large enough sample size to ensure that our estimated 0/1 loss is close to the true 0/1 loss. The sample size required can be calculated using the formula: n >= (ln(1-p)) / (2 * p^2), where n is the sample size, ln is the natural logarithm, p is the probability of error, and 2*p^2 is the variance of the estimated 0/1 loss. Plugging in the values given, we get: n >= (ln(1-0.05))) / (2 * (0.05)^2) = 384.
