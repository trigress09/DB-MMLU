The area enclosed by a curve in polar coordinates is given by the formula A = (1/2) * integral from a to b of [r(θ)]^2 dθ. In this case, r(θ) = ln(θ), so the area is (1/2) * integral from π to 2π of [ln(θ)]^2 dθ. This integral can be evaluated using integration by parts, and it turns out that the area is approximately 3.743.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that $0.\overline7 = \\frac{7}{9}$, so the reciprocal of this value is $\\frac{9}{7}$. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocal of 0.̅7 is 7/9. To express this as a common fraction, we can simplify it by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 1 in this case. Therefore, the simplified form of the reciprocal is 7/9.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The current computer costs twice as much money as the older computer, but it works half as fast. This means that the speed to price ratio of the current computer is twice as high as the older computer. In other words, if we call the speed to price ratio of the older computer 'x', then the speed to price ratio of the current computer is 2x. To find what percent this is of x, we can set up a proportion: \\frac{2x}{x} = \\frac{x}{100}. Simplifying this equation, we get 2 = \\frac{x}{50}, which implies that x = 100. Therefore, the speed to price ratio of the current computer is twice as high as the older computer, or 200% of x.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The current computer's speed to price ratio is 1 (assuming current speed and price are both 1 unit). The older computer's speed was 1/2 and its price was 2, so its speed to price ratio is (1/2) / 2 = 1/4. Therefore, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 4 times the older computer's ratio, which is a 400% increase. The answer choice that corresponds to this increase is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the square of a number is $85$ less than the quantity that is $17$ more than the number. Let's denote the number as x. Then, we can write the equation as: $(x+17)^2 = x^2 + 85$. Now, let's expand and simplify the left-hand side of the equation: $(x+17)^2 = (x^2 + 34x + 289) = x^2 + 34x + 289$. Now, we can equate the two expressions for $x^2$ and solve for $x$: $x^2 + 85 = x^2 + 34x + 289$. Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides gives us: $85 = 34x + 289$. Subtracting $289$ from both sides gives us: $-204 = 34x$. Dividing both sides by $-34$ gives us: $x = \frac{-204}{-34} = 6$. Therefore, the number is $\boxed{6}$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that 85 more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. So, we need to find a number whose square is 85-17=68. This means that the number itself must be √68. However, since the problem asks for an integer value, we can round up or down to get the closest integer value. In this case, rounding up gives us the value of 8.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The area of a triangle is given by the formula (base * height) / 2. In this case, we are given three altitudes with lengths 10, 12, and 15. We can use these values to find the base of each triangle. For example, for the first altitude with length 10, the base would be 20 (since the area is half the base times the height). Similarly, for the second altitude with length 12, the base would be 24, and so on. Once we have found the bases, we can use them to find the areas of each triangle. For example, for the first triangle with base 20 and height 10, the area would be (20 * 10) / 2 = 100. Similarly, for the second triangle with base 24 and height 12, the area would be (24 * 12) / 2 = 144, and so on. Once we have found the areas of each triangle, we can add them up to find the total area of the figure.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the product of its altitudes. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 10 * 12 * 15 = 1800. However, we are asked to find the area in terms of radicals. To do this, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: A = sqrt(p * q * r), where p, q, and r are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. In our case, the lengths of the sides of the triangle are 10, 12, and 15. Therefore, the area of the triangle is given by the formula: A = sqrt(10 * 12 * 15) = sqrt(3600) = 60\\sqrt{7}.",C

Similarly, since we know that $-2 \leq b \leq 4$, the only way for $b$ to be positive is if $0 < b \leq 4$.

The problem states that the circle has a circumference of $12\pi$ units. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by $\pi r^2$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{12}$. Now, we need to find the area of the square whose sides are equal to the radius of this circle. Since the radius is $\sqrt{12}$, the side length of the square will also be $\sqrt{12}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(\sqrt{12})^2 = 12$ square units.",D
