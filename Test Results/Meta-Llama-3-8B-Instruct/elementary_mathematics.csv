To find the discounted price, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and then subtract it from the original price. 10% of $110.99 is $11.099. Subtracting this amount from the original price gives us the discounted price: $110.99 - $11.099 = $99.90. Since the question asks for the price not including tax, we can ignore the tax and simply report the discounted price as $99.90.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

To solve this problem, we need to convert the weight of the dog food from pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in one pound, so we can multiply the weight of the dog food in pounds by 16 to get the total number of ounces. In this case, there are 28 pounds in the bag of dog food, and multiplying that by 16 gives us a total of 448 ounces.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to estimate the sum of 711 and 497. To do this, we can round both numbers to their nearest tens. So, 711 becomes 710 and 497 becomes 500. Now, let's add these rounded numbers: 710 + 500 = 1,210. Since our original numbers were slightly higher than the rounded numbers, the actual sum will be slightly higher than 1,210. Therefore, the correct answer is between 1,200 and 1,300.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both 711 and 497 are relatively small numbers, so their sum should be somewhere between 50 and 400.

In this case, the constant amount is 20. Therefore, the next number in the pattern will be 80 + 20 = 100. However, since we want to find the eighth number in the pattern, we need to keep adding the constant amount until we reach the eighth number.
