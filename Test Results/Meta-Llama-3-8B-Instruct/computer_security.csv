C,"Let's reason step by step. The Kerberos protocol ensures that an expired ticket can no longer be used. This is achieved through a combination of the client and server clocks, as well as the KDC's clock. When a client connects to a server, the server compares the ticket's expiration time to its own current clock, and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket expiration time is in the past. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Kerberos server plays a central role in ticket management and ensures security by refusing to establish new connections between clients and servers if the presented ticket has expired. In this case, option C is the correct answer because it accurately describes how the Kerberos server checks the expiration time of a ticket and refuses to authenticate the user if the ticket has expired.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A buffer overflow occurs when more data is written to a buffer than its capacity allows. This can happen in various situations, such as when writing to a pointer that has been freed (A), or when copying a buffer from the stack to the heap (B). However, these are not typical scenarios for a buffer overflow. The most common scenario is when a program attempts to write data beyond the boundaries of a buffer, often due to an integer overflow or underflow (C).",C,"Let's reason step by step.
