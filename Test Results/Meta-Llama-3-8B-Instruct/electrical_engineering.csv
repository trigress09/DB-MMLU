B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which system is also known as an automatic control system. An open loop control system does not use feedback to adjust its output, whereas a closed loop control system uses feedback to adjust its output. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Closed loop control system.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both open-loop and closed-loop control systems involve automatic control mechanisms, where the system responds to input signals without direct human intervention. However, the key difference lies in whether the system uses feedback or not. Closed-loop control systems use feedback from sensors to adjust the output, whereas open-loop control systems do not use feedback. Therefore, both A and B are correct answers.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the type of errors caused by human mistakes. The options provided are all types of errors, but they are not mutually exclusive. However, if we look at the context of the question and the options provided, it seems that the most likely answer is C, observational error.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

LC circuits, with their combination of inductors and capacitors, exhibit resonant frequencies and have both zeros and poles in their transfer functions, which can influence the critical frequencies. Therefore, it is most likely that the lowest critical frequency is due to zero and may be present at the origin or nearer to the origin, then the type of network is an LC circuit.",A

High-frequency eddy current heating typically utilizes frequencies in the kilohertz range, similar to those used in common electrical appliances and power systems. The most suitable answer is therefore D: 10 KHz to 400 KHz.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The magnetisation and applied field in ferromagnetic materials are related because the magnetic moment of a ferromagnetic material is proportional to the strength of the external magnetic field. This means that as the applied field increases, the magnetization also increases proportionally. Therefore, the relationship between the magnetization and applied field is linear.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The magnetization of a ferromagnetic material typically follows a sinusoidal pattern in response to an applied magnetic field, similar to the relationship between voltage and current in an AC circuit.

This makes sense because the LSB is the rightmost bit and it has the least significant value in the binary number.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since we read numbers from left to right, the last digit in a binary number, which is the one on the rightmost side, should be the most significant bit. Therefore, the correct answer is B: MSB, Most Significant Bit.",B

C,"Let's reason step by step. The dielectric constant is a measure of the ability of an insulating material to store electric charge. Air is an insulator, and its ability to store electric charge is relatively low compared to other materials. Therefore, the value of the dielectric constant of air is less than 1.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Air, as a gaseous medium with minimal electrical conductivity, should have a dielectric constant that is close to zero or even negative, indicating its insulating properties. However, the actual value of the dielectric constant of air is slightly greater than zero due to the presence of impurities and other factors. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 1.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The statement says that the conductor is static and the field is varying, which means that there is a relative motion between the conductor and the magnetic field. This relative motion induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the conductor, according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. Therefore, the correct answer is B: dynamically induced emf.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A varying magnetic field implies a dynamic change in the magnetic flux, which in turn induces an electromotive force (emf) in a conductor through a process known as dynamic induction.

The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) is one of the main components of the microprocessor, responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the microprocessor is only the ALU.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A microprocessor, as the central processing unit of a computer, requires memory to store both the instructions it executes and the data it processes. Therefore, a microprocessor is essentially an ALU and memory unit combined on a single chip. In this case, the most appropriate answer is B: 'and memory on a single chip.'",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The duty cycle is the ratio of the time for which the switch is closed to the total period of one cycle. In this case, the input voltage is 110 V and the output voltage is 150 V. This means that the output voltage is higher than the input voltage, which indicates that there must be some sort of amplification or boost happening in the circuit. Given these facts, we can conclude that the duty cycle is likely to be greater than 0.5, since the output voltage is higher than the input voltage. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 0.67.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The duty cycle represents the ratio between the input and output voltage. So the duty cycle is 110/150=0.73. However, since the question asks for the value of duty cycle, we need to round it off to two decimal places. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.73, which rounds off to 0.73.",B

A,"Let's reason step by step. The thermal heating time constant is given as 50 mm, which means that the motor's temperature will rise to 80\u00b0 C after a certain period of continuous operation at full load. To find the temperature rise after 1 hour, we need to calculate the temperature rise per unit time. Since the final temperature rise is 80\u00b0 C and the thermal heating time constant is 50 mm, we can set up an equation as follows: \u03c8 = (80 - 20) / 50 = 56\u00b0 C. Therefore, after 1 hour of continuous operation at full load, the motor's temperature will rise to approximately 56\u00b0 C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The temperature rise is 80° C for 50 minutes, so the temperature rise per minute is 80/50=1.6 ° C. After 1 hour, the temperature rise will be 60*1.6=96° C. However, this exceeds the maximum temperature rise of 80° C. Therefore, we need to calculate the temperature rise after 50 minutes and then extrapolate it to 1 hour.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A p-n junction, when reverse biased, acts as an open circuit or a high resistance path. This is because the majority carriers (electrons in n-type material and holes in p-type material) are blocked from flowing through the junction due to the potential barrier created by the depletion region. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Off Switch.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A diode is like a transistor, and when it is reverse biased, it allows current to flow from the source to the drain.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to the square of its diameter. Therefore, if the diameter of the conductor is halved and its length is doubled, the resistance will be affected in the following way: the diameter being halved means that the resistance will increase by a factor of 2^2 = 4, since the resistance is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter. On the other hand, the length being doubled means that the resistance will also double, since the resistance is directly proportional to the length. Therefore, the overall effect on the resistance will be a multiplication by a factor of 4 * 2 = 8.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The resistance of a conductor is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. If the diameter is halved, the area is divided by 2, and if the length is doubled, the resistance is multiplied by 2. So the new resistance will be R*2/2=R. Therefore, the correct answer is A: R Ω.",A

The force per meter of length between two parallel conductors carrying current is given by the formula F = μI / (2πr), where F is the force, μ is the magnetic permeability of free space, I is the current in each conductor, and r is the distance between the centers of the conductors. In this case, we are given that the conductors carry 100 A, and they are separated by 20 mm. We can plug these values into the formula to get F = μI / (2πr) = (4π × 10^(-7) T m/A) × (100 A) / (2π × 0.02 m)) ≈ 1 N. Therefore, the force per meter of length between the two conductors is approximately 1 N.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The force per meter of length between two parallel conductors carrying current is given by F/L=μ_0*I_1*I_2/(2πd). Plugging in the values, we get F/L=2*10^{-7}*100*100/(20*10^{-3})=1 N/m.
