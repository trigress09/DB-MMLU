The question asks which representation of numbers by 8-bit words allows the addition of integers 109 and -42 within range.\n\nIn one's complement representation, the most significant bit (MSB) is used to indicate the sign of the number. In this case, since both numbers have different signs, we cannot use one's complement representation for adding these two numbers.\n\nTwo's complement representation is similar to one's complement representation, but it has an additional step where the MSB is set to 1 before performing the addition. This allows us to add positive and negative numbers without worrying about the sign of the result.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that only two's complement representation allows the addition of integers 109 and -42 within range.\n\nThe correct answer is B: II only.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Two's complement is only used for representing positive numbers, while one's complement and sign and magnitude can represent both positive and negative numbers.

Hence, the correct answer is D: I, II, and III.",D

This is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, which can be solved using the characteristic equation method. The characteristic equation is x - 3 = 0, which has the solution x = 3. Therefore, the general solution to the recurrence relation is T(n) = c * 3^n + d, where c and d are constants. Since we know that T(1) = 7, we can solve for c: 7 = c * 3^1 => c = 7/3. Similarly, since we know that T(2) = 19, we can solve for d: 19 = (7/3) * 3^2 + d => d = 19 - (7/3) * 3^2 = 19 - 14 = 5. Therefore, the general solution to the recurrence relation is T(n) = (7/3) * 3^n + 5. The order of growth of this function is O(3^n), which corresponds to option C: \u0398(n^2).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The recursive calls within the function definition suggest a logarithmic factor, leading to an overall order of growth of O(n^2 log n).",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking which instruction-set feature is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining of an integer unit? Pipelining is a technique used in CPU design where multiple instructions are processed simultaneously, improving the overall performance of the processor. Aggressive pipelining refers to the ability of a processor to pipeline instructions aggressively, i.e., without waiting for previous instructions to complete execution. In this context, instruction-set features that can hinder aggressive pipelining include condition codes set by every instruction (A), variable-length encoding of instructions (B), and instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute (C). On the other hand, several different classes (sets) of registers (D) is not generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Variable-length instructions require additional processing to determine their boundaries and align them properly, hindering efficient pipelining. On the other hand, condition codes set by every instruction are a common feature in many instruction sets, but they do not directly impact pipelining. Similarly, instructions requiring widely varying numbers of cycles to execute can be handled through dynamic scheduling, which does not necessarily hinder pipelining. Finally, several different classes (sets) of registers are also common features in many instruction sets, and they do not directly impact pipelining either. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Variable-length encoding of instructions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement I is correct because true means the word was in the dictionary, and false means the word was not in the dictionary. Statement II is also correct because it implies that if a word is not in the dictionary, then the program will return false. Statement III is incorrect because there is no direct correlation between the size of the document and the size of the hash table.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking. Therefore, statements I and II are correct. Statement III is also true because as the document size increases, the number of words to be checked against the dictionary also increases, making it necessary to increase the hash table size accordingly.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The microcomputer is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate. The average instruction execution time is given as 5 CPU instructions per signal digitized, and 10 CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. Therefore, the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is",B
