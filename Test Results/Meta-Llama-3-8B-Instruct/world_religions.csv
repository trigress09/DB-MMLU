This is a historical fact that can be verified through various sources, including historical texts and scholarly articles. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Synods.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both Sees and Synods play a role in church administration, potentially leading to confusion between the terms.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The Pharisees were a Jewish group that emerged during the Second Temple period. They were known for their strict adherence to the Torah and their emphasis on ritual purity.

It is often translated as 'perfect knowledge' or 'complete understanding'. Therefore, within the Jaina traditions, samyak jnanawould refer to the highest level of spiritual knowledge and understanding.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Samyak jnana and samyak charitra are both essential aspects of the Jaina path to liberation, potentially leading to confusion between the two concepts.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The Egyptian composition Ludul Bel Nemequi is a hymn to Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. In this hymn, Marduk is portrayed as a powerful and wise god who has saved the city from chaos. Therefore, it can be inferred that Marduk is portrayed in this hymn as loving and forgiving.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Marduk, as a powerful and dominant deity in the Babylonian pantheon, would likely be portrayed as a figure of judgment and vengeance, maintaining order and punishing transgressions. The Egyptian composition Ludul Bel Nemequi, which praises the Lord of wisdom, does not necessarily portray Marduk in this manner, but rather emphasizes his role as a wise and powerful deity.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about sacred literature originating with a jina.

Among the options, Rsabha is a jina who is credited with creating the first Jain text, the 'Bhagavati'. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Rsabha.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sri Lakshmi, as a goddess associated with knowledge and auspiciousness, could be linked to the origins of sacred literature, as her blessings are often sought for intellectual pursuits. However, Mahavira is not typically associated with sacred literature, but rather with Jainism and its ascetic practices. Rsabha is also not directly related to sacred literature, but rather with the concept of 'Rsabha' in Jainism, which refers to a stage of spiritual development. Nanak is also not directly related to sacred literature, as he was the founder of Sikhism and his teachings are primarily focused on spirituality and ethics. Therefore, based on our reasoning, we can conclude that Sri Lakshmi is most likely associated with the origins of sacred literature.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. Guru Nanak was the founder of Sikhism and is considered one of the most important figures in Sikh history. The term 'Shabad' refers to a sacred word or phrase that is considered divine revelation.

Oracle Days, involving consultations with oracles and prophetic figures, often female priestesses, could be seen as female-centered festivals due to the prominence of women in these rituals. However, Thesmophoria, a festival dedicated to the goddess Demeter and her daughter Persephone, is more specifically focused on the feminine realm and the mysteries of femininity. Therefore, it can be argued that Thesmophoria was the most important female- centered festival in cities throughout Greece.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about a Japanese festival where the spirits of deceased family members return to receive ritual offerings of food made by their loved ones.
