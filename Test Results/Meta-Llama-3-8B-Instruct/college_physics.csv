C,"Let's reason step by step. The observer O at rest midway between two sources of light observes them to flash simultaneously. This means that the distance between the two sources is equal to the speed of light multiplied by the time it takes for one source to flash relative to the other. According to the second observer O', moving at a constant speed parallel to the x-axis, one source of light flashes 13 ns before the other.

Since kinetic energy depends on both mass and velocity, the uncertainties should add up, leading to a 15% uncertainty in kinetic energy. However, since we are given that the uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligibly small, we can ignore this contribution to the uncertainty. Therefore, the correct answer is 10%.

The distance between the siren and the person is 1 km or 1000 m. We can use the formula v = d/t to find the time it takes for the sound wave to reach the person: t = d/v = 1000/385 ≈ 2.6 seconds.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The speed of sound is given as 3 percent lower than it would be at 20\u00b0C. This means that the speed of sound at this temperature is 97% of its value at 20\u00b0C. Now, we know that the frequency of a pipe open at both ends resonates inversely with the speed of sound. Therefore, if the speed of sound decreases by 3%, then the frequency of the pipe will increase by 3%. The original frequency is given as 440 Hz. Therefore, the new frequency can be calculated as follows: New Frequency = Original Frequency * (1 + 0.03) = 440 Hz * (1 + 0.03) = 440 Hz * 1.0303 = 453.1332 Hz. Since we are looking for an answer in terms of Hz, the correct answer is 453 Hz.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the speed of sound decreases by 3%, the frequency should also decrease by 3%, resulting in a resonant frequency of approximately 414 Hz.

The wavelength of the hydrogen lines observed in the spectrum of the quasar 3C9 is three times as long as those observed in the light from hydrogen atoms at rest in a laboratory on Earth. This means that the frequency of the light emitted by the quasar is one-third of the frequency of the light emitted by the hydrogen atoms at rest. If we assume that the shift is entirely due to the relative motion of 3C9 and Earth, then the relative speed of the quasar can be calculated using the formula v = λf, where v is the velocity, λ is the wavelength, and f is the frequency. Substituting the values given in the problem, we get v = (3/1) × (c/3), which simplifies to v = 0.8c.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the wavelengths are three times longer, that implies the quasar is moving away at the speed of light, c.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks for the work done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach a speed of about 0.6c, assuming it starts at rest. We can use the formula W = ΔK, where W is the work done and ΔK is the change in kinetic energy. Since the particle starts at rest, its initial kinetic energy is zero. Therefore, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the final kinetic energy of the particle, which is given by K = (1/2)mv^2. We are given that v = 0.6c, where c is the speed of light. Substituting this value into the formula for kinetic energy, we get K = (1/2)m(0.6c)^2. Simplifying this expression, we get K = 0.12mc^2. Therefore, the work done on the particle is equal to the change in its kinetic energy, which is given by W = ΔK = 0.12mc^2.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Now, let's consider the acceleration vector. Since the particle is accelerating at a rate of 10 meters per second squared, this means that the acceleration vector is directed towards the center of the circle. Now, we can use the fact that the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is equal to the angle between the radius and the tangent to the circle. This means that the angle between the velocity and acceleration vectors is 45\u00b0. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

The area of the coil is 0.2 m^2 and it has 250 turns. When the magnetic field increases from 0.01 T to 0.06 T during a time interval of 0.25 s, the average induced EMF in the coil can be calculated using Faraday's law of induction. The formula for calculating the induced EMF is: ε = -N(dΦ/dt), where N is the number of turns in the coil and Φ is the magnetic flux through the coil. Substituting the given values, we get: ε = -250(0.06 T - 0.01 T)(0.2 m^2) = -10 V",D,"Let's reason step by step. Using Faraday's Law, we find that the induced EMF is approximately 0.04 V.

The initial kinetic energy of the system is given by K = (m + 2m) * v^2 / 2, where m and 2m are the masses of the particles before the collision, and v is their relative velocity. After the collision, the two particles stick together to form a single particle with mass 3m. The kinetic energy of this particle after the collision is given by K' = (3m) * v'^2 / 2, where v' is its velocity after the collision. Since the particles stick together, their velocities before and after the collision are equal. Therefore, we can set up an equation to relate the initial and final kinetic energies: K - K' = ΔK = 0. This means that the kinetic energy of the system remains constant during the collision, which is a characteristic of elastic collisions. Therefore, the fraction of the initial kinetic energy lost in the collision is zero.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In an inelastic collision, kinetic energy is not conserved, so all of the initial kinetic energy must be lost. The particles stick together after the collision, which means that their total momentum remains constant. However, since they are now stuck together, they have a combined mass that is greater than either of their individual masses. This means that their combined velocity will be less than either of their individual velocities before the collision. Since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of an object's velocity, this means that the total kinetic energy of the system after the collision must be less than it was before the collision.

To measure the length of the rod as 0.80 m, the observer must be moving at a speed such that the time dilation effect cancels out the contraction of the rod. This can be calculated using the Lorentz transformation formula for time dilation. Plugging in the values given, we get v = 0.60c.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for time dilation in special relativity is t' = t / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). We can rearrange this formula to solve for v and find the required velocity.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The plane is traveling due north at a constant speed of 100 m/s, which means its velocity vector is purely in the northerly direction. When the payload is released, it will continue to move with the same velocity as the plane, but since it's no longer attached to the plane, its motion will be relative to the plane. Since the plane is moving due north at 100 m/s, and the payload is also moving in the northerly direction, we can conclude that the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is purely in the northerly direction, which means it's equal to the velocity of the plane minus the initial downward velocity of the payload. Since the initial downward velocity of the payload is 0 (since it was released from rest), the velocity of the payload relative to the plane is simply the velocity of the plane, which is 100 m/s north.

For an ideal gas, the internal energy is a function of temperature only. Therefore, for any process where the temperature remains constant, the change in internal energy will be zero.

Antimony and bismuth are not typically used as dopants in germanium. Therefore, option D, Bismuth, is the correct answer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The heat pump is extracting heat from the outdoor environment at 7\u00b0C and delivering it to the indoor environment at 27\u00b0C. For each 15,000 J of heat delivered indoors, the smallest amount of work that must be supplied to the heat pump is approximately",B,"Let's reason step by step. The work done by the heat pump is the difference between the heat delivered indoors and the heat extracted outdoors. So, the work done should be 15,000 J - (15,000 J * (7/27)) = 11,111 J, which is approximately 500 J. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 500 J.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given information is that the electron is in the l = 2 state. This means that the orbital angular momentum of the electron is 2. Now, for a given value of l, there are (2l + 1) possible values of m_l. In this case, since l = 2, we have (2*2 + 1) = 5 possible values of m_l. Therefore, the correct answer is D: 5.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The quantum number m_l can take on values from -l to +l, including 0. Since l = 2, the allowed values of m_l are -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, which gives us a total of 2 values. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 2.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The fundamental frequency of the organ pipe is C (131 Hz). To find the next higher harmonic, we need to multiply the fundamental frequency by an integer. In this case, the next higher harmonic would be the second harmonic, which is twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic for this pipe is 2 x 131 Hz = 262 Hz.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The next higher harmonic is typically twice the fundamental frequency. Therefore, the frequency of the next higher harmonic should be 2 * 131 Hz = 262 Hz. This matches option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The three-dimensional harmonic oscillator is in thermal equilibrium with a temperature reservoir at temperature T. This means that the average total energy of the oscillator is equal to the average total energy of the particles in the reservoir, which is given by (3/2) kT. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the equipartition theorem, each degree of freedom contributes (1/2)kT to the average energy. A harmonic oscillator has one degree of freedom, so the average total energy should be (1/2)kT. The correct answer is therefore A.",A
