A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the number sentence 72 * h = 6, where h represents the number of horses. To find the value of h, we can set up an equation using the given information: 72 * h = 6. Since Gary has 72 cows, we want to determine how many horses he has based on the relationship between cows and horses. We can solve for h by dividing both sides of the equation by 72: (72 * h) / 72 = 6 / 72. This simplifies to just h = 1/12. However, we need to find the number of horses as a whole value, not a fraction. To do this, we can multiply both sides by 12: h * 12 = (1/12) * 12. This gives us h = 1. Therefore, Gary has h = 1 which means he has 12 horses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Gary has 6 times as many cows as horses, we need to multiply the number of cows by 6 to find the number of horses, which gives us 432 horses. However, we are given that this product is equal to the number of cows multiplied by the number of horses (72 * h = 6). We can rearrange this equation to solve for h: h = 6 / 72.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5 parts. To find out how many parts of oil correspond to 9 parts of vinegar, we can set up a proportion: 2/5 = 9/x, where x represents the number of parts for oil. Cross-multiplying, we get 10 * 9 = 2 * x. Simplifying this equation gives us 90 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 45. Since each part is equivalent to a certain number of ounces, the total number of ounces of oil would be 45 parts * 1 ounce/part (assuming equal volume for each part). Therefore, 45 * 1 = 45 ounces of oil should be mixed with 9 ounces of vinegar.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the ratio of vinegar to oil is 2:5, then we simply need to multiply the amount of vinegar (9 ounces) by 5 to find the amount of oil needed, resulting in 45 ounces of oil. Since the total parts are 7, we divide 45 by 7 to get 63 ounces of oil. However, this is not among the given choices. We should have obtained 63 as an answer, but it's not provided. The closest option seems to be 22.5 (C). While this isn't accurate in comparison with our calculated value, it still represents a larger quantity than the other options and aligns more closely with the given ratio.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the next time when both Bus A and Bus B leave at the same time, we need to find the common multiples of their respective intervals (75 minutes for Bus A and 15 minutes for Bus B). The smallest multiple that is a common factor for both intervals is 15 * 5 = 75 minutes. This means that after 5 cycles of Bus B's departure, it will align with one cycle of Bus A's departure. Since Bus B starts at 6:00 a.m., its next departure would be at 6:15 a.m., and the time when both buses leave at the same time would be 6:15 + 75 = 8:30 a.m. However, this option is not given in the choices. The closest answer among the provided options is C: '7:30 a.m.'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since Bus A leaves every 75 minutes and Bus B leaves every 15 minutes, they will both leave together again after 75 + 15 = 90 minutes, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes after 6:00 a.m. Therefore, the next time they'll leave at the same time is 6:00 a.m. + 1:30 = 7:30 a.m.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We first need to determine how many quarters Marcus used. Since one quarter is worth $0.25, and he spent $3.25, he used 3.25 / 0.25 = 13 quarters. We know that one quarter operates the car wash for 60 seconds. Therefore, the total time it took him to wash his car would be the number of quarters multiplied by the duration per quarter: 13 quarters * 60 seconds/quarter = 780 seconds. To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60: 780 seconds / 60 = 13 minutes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If it costs $3.25 for 60 seconds, then we simply need to divide the total cost by the cost per minute to find the total time. This gives us 3.25 / 0.25 = 13 minutes. Therefore, it took Marcus 13 minutes to wash his car.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. To obtain a representative sample, we want to include a diverse group of people who visit the shopping mall. Choosing option A (one shoe store) or D (a mile away from the mall) would not provide an accurate representation as they exclude most stores and are not directly related to mall visitors. Option B (all shoe stores) might be better than A, but it still focuses only on a specific type of store. On the other hand, option C (the entrance to the mall) allows for sampling from all types of shoppers entering the mall, providing a more diverse and representative sample.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To get the most representative sample of shoppers, the survey should be conducted at all shoe stores in the mall, as this would capture the opinions of a wider variety of shoppers compared to just one entrance. However, surveying at the entrance to the mall (option C) is likely to provide a more comprehensive and diverse set of responses since people entering from different entrances might have visited various shops or services within the mall. Option D would not be suitable as it's conducted far away from the mall and may include non-shoppers.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Michelle did 45 push-ups each day for a total of 31 days in January. To find the total number of push-ups she did during the month, we can use the given expression: 31 \u00d7 45 (where \u00d7 represents multiplication). Performing this calculation, we get 31 * 45 = 1,395. Therefore, Michelle did 1,395 push-ups in January.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Michelle did 45 push-ups each day for 31 days, we need to subtract the number of days from the number of push-ups per day. This gives us 45 - 31 = 14 push-ups per day. Then we multiply that by the number of days to find the total, which is 14 x 31 = 434 push-ups. However, this question seems to have used multiplication instead of division. So, we should use multiplication to calculate the total push-ups: 31 \u00d7 45 = 1,395 push-ups.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we calculate (2 + 5)^2 which equals 7^2 = 49. Next, we subtract 42 from 49 to get the final result. So, 49 - 42 = 33.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Following the order of operations, we first square 2 and 5 individually, then add them together. This gives us 4 + 25 = 29. Next, we perform the subtraction operation (29) - 42. Calculating this, we get -13. However, since a result in parentheses was involved, we need to consider the absolute value of -13. The absolute value of -13 is 13. Now, let's check our answer choices: only choice C (30) is greater than 13. This indicates that there might be an error in the given answers. However, as per instructions, we have to choose one from the given options and our correct answer should be closest to the calculated value of 13.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Start with parentheses and exponents, then multiplication and division from left to right, followed by addition and subtraction from left to right. In this case, there are no parentheses or exponents. We have 4 \u00f7 (4 *), then 2 \u2022 (2 ^, which means 2 raised to the power of 2, or 4). Next, we perform addition: 4 * 2 + 8 = 16. Finally, subtraction: 16 - 4 = 12. Now let's compare this value with the given choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Following the order from left to right, we first divide 4 by 2, then multiply by 2, then add 8, and finally subtract 4. This gives us 1 + 4 + 8 - 4 = 9.

Sonia and Negin have $27.00 together, and after buying a shirt and sandals, they will still have some money left, so the answer must be greater than $5.00. To find out how much remains, we need to subtract the total cost of their purchases from their initial amount. The total cost is $12.35 (shirt) + $10.11 (sandals) = $22.46. Now, let's find out how much money remains: $27.00 - $22.46 = $4.54. Among the given options, this is closest to answer B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. To round a number to the nearest hundred, we look at the tens place. In this case, the tens digit is 9. Since 9 is closer to 10 than it is to 0, when rounded up to the nearest hundred, 794 becomes 800. Therefore, the correct answer is finding the closest hundred to 794.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The number 794 is closer to 700 than it is to 800, so we should round down to the nearest hundred. However, since we are rounding to the nearest hundred and not the nearest ten, we cannot simply ignore the last two digits (i.e., 94). Instead, we need to consider that 794 is closer to 800 than it is to 700. Therefore, when rounded to the nearest hundred, 794 becomes 800.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The riddle describes an object with 2 faces, which means it is a flat shape without any edges or corners (vertices). This eliminates options A (cone) and D (prism), as they both have vertices. Additionally, the ability to roll suggests that this object has some degree of roundness. Among the remaining options B (cylinder) and C (sphere), a cylinder can technically be rolled but does not fully satisfy the description of having only 2 faces. A sphere, on the other hand, is perfectly round with no vertices or edges, fitting both criteria in the riddle. Therefore, the answer to Tisha's riddle is most likely a sphere.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The riddle mentions having 2 faces and the ability to roll, which suggests a shape with multiple flat sides like a prism. However, prisms have vertices (corners). Since no vertices are allowed in this riddle, we can eliminate option D. Now, let's consider options A, B, and C. Cones and cylinders both have only one face, so they don't match the given condition. Lastly, a sphere has a continuous round surface without any distinct faces or vertices, making it the best fit for the riddle's description.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to convert the given expression into a standard decimal multiplication form. We can rewrite 2.16 \u00f7 0.06 as (2.16 * 0.06). Now, perform the multiplication: 2.16 * 0.06 = 0.1276. To find the quotient, there seems to be a typo in the question since division is not indicated. However, assuming you meant multiplication, we found the product. Comparing this result with the given choices, the closest option is C: 0.01272.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If we multiply 216 by 6, we get 1296, and since we are dividing by a decimal, the answer should be greater than 10. Now let's convert 2.16 \u00f7 0.06 to a more readable form: (216 / 6). Performing this division, we get an approximate value of 36. However, since the decimal point is in the denominator, we need to move it to the numerator as well.

Multiplying 30 by 60 gives us 1800, and adding the product of the remaining digits will bring us close to 1900. Therefore, we can estimate that the product of 32 x 67 should be around 1,900. Among the given options, only option B matches our estimation closely. However, it's slightly higher than our estimated range.

A,"Let's reason step by step. To make the given statement true, we need to find a number that makes the fraction 48/88 equivalent to ?/11. We can find this number by finding the reciprocal of 11 and then multiplying both sides of the equation by it. So, (48/88) * (11/11) = ?. This simplifies to (4*11)/(8*11). Canceling out common factors gives us 4/8 or 1/2. Now, let's find the corresponding answer from the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To make the denominator 11, we need to divide 88 by 8, so we should also divide the numerator 48 by 8 to maintain the proportion.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find an inequality that represents any weight of a book chosen from the shelf. Since we are looking for the smallest and largest possible weights, we can take the minimum and maximum values of the given weights. The smallest weight is 2.3 and the largest weight is 3.2. Therefore, if we choose any book from the shelf, its weight will be greater than the smallest (2.3) and less than the largest (3.3). However, since we are given a choice of inequalities, we can rewrite our inequality as 'w > 2.3' and 'w < 3.3'. Among the provided options, only option D provides this range with 'w < 3.3', but it is not inclusive for the smallest weight. Therefore, the closest option to our reasoning is option A: 'w > 2.3'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The lightest book on the shelf weighs 2.3 pounds, so any book chosen from the shelf must weigh more than 2.3 pounds. Option A satisfies this condition. However, we also need to consider that the inequality should include all possible weights of books on the shelf. Option D represents an upper limit of less than 3.3 pounds, which includes all given weights (2.5, 3.2, 2.7, and 2.3). But since we are looking for a lower bound, option A is more suitable. Therefore, the correct inequality is 'w > 2.3'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the best buy, we need to calculate the cost per bar of soap for each option. We can do this by dividing the total price by the number of bars.

Comparing these costs per bar, we see that option B has the lowest cost at $2.28. Therefore, buying 16 bars of soap for $36.48 (option B) is the best buy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The best buy should offer the most bars of soap for the given price range, so the option with 16 bars seems like the best choice. However, we need to calculate the cost per bar to compare accurately. We can do this by dividing the total price by the number of bars: A = $23.20/10, B = $36.48/16, C = $29.51/13, and D = $27.60/12. The cost per bar for each option is as follows: A = $2.32, B = $2.28, C = $2.27, and D = $2.30. Comparing these values, we find that option B provides the best value with a lower cost per bar at $2.28 for 16 bars of soap.",B

To solve for m, we cross-multiply: 18.5 * 7.5 = 3.60 * m. Then, we divide both sides by 3.60 to isolate m. Calculating this gives us m = (18.5 * 7.5) / 3.60. This simplifies to m = 92.625 / 3.60. To round the result to the nearest hundredth, we approximate it as m โ 25.73. Now, let's find the value of dol over m gal by setting up an equation: dol over m gal = 18.5 / m. Plugging in the value of m, we get dol over m gal = 18.5 / 25.73. This simplifies to dol over m gal โ 0.720. To find the equivalent value for one gallon, multiply this by 1: dol over 1 gal = 0.720 * 1 = 0.72. Now, let's compare this with the given answer choices to determine which is closest to our calculated value.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We are looking for a pair of expressions that are equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. In option A, we have the expressions '3(x+2)' and '3x+2'. When you distribute the multiplication, '3(x+2)' becomes '3x+6', but since we want to compare it with '3x+2', we can subtract 4 from both sides. This results in '3x' on both sides, making these expressions equivalent for any variable value greater than zero. The other options do not satisfy this condition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If we multiply one term in an expression by a constant, all other terms are also multiplied by the same constant to maintain equivalence. In option A, '3(x+2)' can be expanded as '3x + 6', which is equivalent to '3x + 2' when we subtract 4 from both sides. Therefore, option A is a valid pair of expressions for any variable value greater than zero. None of the other options follow this equivalence rule.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go to graduate school. This can be represented as a fraction, which is 2/5. To find the number of seniors attending graduate school, we need to multiply this fraction with the total number of seniors (750). So, our calculation would be: (2/5) * 750 = 150 * 1.4 = 210. While this is not an exact match to any given answer choice, the closest one is 300 seniors.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If 2 out of 5 seniors do not go to graduate school, then 3 out of 5 do. So, we need to find 3/5 of 750. Multiplying 3 and 750 gives us 2250, and dividing by 5 gives us the number of seniors attending graduate school. Therefore, approximately 450 seniors would be expected to attend graduate school.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can list their prime factors and identify the smallest power for each prime factor that appears in both numbers. For 25, the prime factorization is 5 ร 5. For 55, the prime factorization is 3 ร 5 ร 5. The common prime factors are 5 and 5 with a minimum exponent of 1. So, the GCD is $5^1$ = 5. Now we can compare this result to the given options.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The least common multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 25 and 55. First, we find the prime factorization of each number: 25 = 5 ร 5 and 55 = 3 ร 5 ร 7. To find their LCM (least common multiple), we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, it would be 3 ร 5 ร 5 ร 7 = 165. Now, to find the GCD (greatest common divisor) between these two numbers, we can use the fact that GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a). Since 25 and 55 are relatively small numbers, we can directly check their factors: The common factors of both numbers are 5. Therefore, the GCD is 5.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The ratio of blue cars to white cars is 5:3. To find the total number of car parts in this ratio, we add 5 and 3 which equals 8. Therefore, for every 8 cars produced, there are 5 blue cars and 3 white cars. If the company makes 15 white cars in one day, we can divide that by 3 to find the number of ratios (15/3 = 5). Since each ratio represents a set of 8 cars, the company will make 5 * 5 = 25 blue cars.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For every 3 white cars, there are 5 blue cars. So, for 15 white cars, we add 5 cars for each group of 3, resulting in 5 + 5 + 5 = 17 blue cars. Therefore, the company will make 17 blue cars.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Each option involves adding the numbers 64 and 8, which means we are looking for a situation where these quantities can be combined in some logical manner. Option A suggests combining students on buses, B combines pens and pencils, C deals with removing books from a bookcase, and D concerns distributing cups among tables. In these scenarios, the expression 64 + 8 represents the total number of students/pens+pencils/books-removed/cups in each case. Among all options, option A seems to fit best as it directly adds quantities without any subtraction or distribution involved.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The expression 64 + 8 represents the total number of items when we combine a group of 64 items with another group of 8 items. We can analyze each option based on this understanding. Option A involves students on buses, which could potentially add up to 64 + 8. In Option B, Ms. Vance has pens and pencils, but the context doesn't necessarily imply combining two groups of items. Option C refers to removing books from a bookcase, not adding them. Lastly, in Option D, Mr. Juarez distributes cups among tables, which also does not directly involve adding 64 and 8 cups. Therefore, the situation that best fits the expression is found in Option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Katie is finding the total number of days she will miss by multiplying 5 (the number of days worked per week) and 3 (the number of weeks on vacation). This can be represented as 5 * 3. To find alternative expressions, we can rewrite multiplication using addition. In this case, we want to replace the multiplication with consecutive additions. The closest expression among the given choices is 'B' - 3+3+3, which represents (5*1) + (5*2), or in other words, 5 days for the first week plus 5 days for the second week.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total number of workdays missed, we need to add the number of weeks she is on vacation to itself multiple times, once for each workday in a week. In this case, Katie will miss 5 days of work each week for 3 weeks. The expression that represents this concept is 5 multiplied by 3 (5 \u00d7 3).

D,"Let's reason step by step. If 24% of the students purchased their lunch, then the remaining 100% - 24% = 76% brought their lunch from home. Since we know that 190 students brought their lunch from home in this percentage, we can set up a proportion: (76% of total students) / 100% = 190 students / x (total number of students). Solving for x, we get x = 190 * (100/76). Calculating this gives us x โ 250.46. Since the answer should be one of the given options, the closest value is 250.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If 190 students represent 76% of the sixth grade (100% - 24%), then we can simply divide the number of students who brought lunch by 0.76 to find the total number of students. So, the calculation would be: Total_students = 190 / 0.76. This gives us a result of approximately 250.44. Since we cannot have a fraction of students in a grade, we can round this up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are about 250 students in the sixth grade.",D

In set A, the negative integers are not in order and there's a mismatch between positive and negative integers. Set B has correctly arranged negative integers but still mixed with positive integers. In set C, negative integers are out of order, and the positive integer (11) is placed before one of the negative integers. Finally, set D has both negative and positive integers in their respective orders. Therefore, the only set that maintains this order is set D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Negative numbers decrease in value as they move further away from zero, so the order should be from the most negative to the least negative, followed by positive numbers in ascending order.

Option C has a constant increment of 15, which does not match our requirement. In option D, the increments are also inconsistent as it adds 15 from 30 to 40 and then adds 15 again from 40 to 55.

Since there are no additional partial boxes used due to the remainder being 0, Rob uses approximately 6 boxes of cat food per month.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days, he will need 4 boxes for a 20-day period. A month typically has around 30 to 31 days, so we can consider it as approximately 30 days.

A,"Let's reason step by step. To write a mixed number as an improper fraction, we can first find the whole number part and the fractional part separately. In this case, 8 and 2 over 4 can be broken down into 2 whole numbers (since 8 is divisible by 4) and a remainder of 2 over 4. The fractional part, 2 over 4, can be simplified to 1 over 2 by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2. Now, we combine the whole number part (2) with the simplified fractional part (1 over 2). However, since this is asking for an improper fraction, we need to make the denominator greater than the numerator.

B,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the value of 'm'. The equation given is 124 = m + 34. To isolate 'm', we subtract 34 from both sides of the equation. This gives us 124 - 34 = m.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the question as it asks to solve for an equation where m is on one side and the constant term (34) is on the other side. Nonetheless, if we assume that you meant to subtract 34 from both sides of the equation, then we can do so: 124 - 34 = m. This simplifies to 90, which means m = 90.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The number 145,826 is written in the standard form of a digit for each place value (hundreds, thousands, tens, and ones). In this case, the first three digits (145) represent thousands, hundreds, and tens respectively. The last two digits (82) represent tens and ones. Since we are asked about the value of the 5 in the number, it is the fifth digit from the right, which is the second digit in the last pair (26). This indicates that the 5 represents the value for tens. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The digit 5 is in the third position from the right, which corresponds to the hundreds place. In numbers with commas (like 145,826), each group of three digits before the decimal point represents a different order of magnitude.

The numerator becomes 5 and the denominator remains 24. Thus, the sum is 5/24. To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of 5 and 24 which is 1.

Comparing this with the given options, the closest positive value is 11. Therefore, the solution for p is 11.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To form a proportion, the product of the first term (numerator) and second fraction's denominator must be equal to the product of the second term (numerator) and first fraction's denominator. This can be represented as: A/B = C/D where AD = BC. Let's check each pair:",A,"Let's reason step by step. A proportion is formed when two ratios are equivalent. Since both ratios in option C have the same denominator of 25, they must form a proportion.

No other options have this property.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Keri spent 1 over 2 hour on science, which can be simplified to 1/2 hour. Since she spent equal amounts of time on all subjects, this means that each subject took up 1/2 hour for her. If the total time spent on homework is 3 hours, then we can find the number of subjects by dividing the total time by the time spent on one subject: 3 hours / 1/2 hour = 6 units. Therefore, Keri studied 6 subjects.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Keri spent 3 hours on homework and each subject took 1/2 hour, then she must have studied 3 / (1/2) = 6 subjects. However, the given information states that she spent 1 over 2 hour on science, which is consistent with the total time distribution among all subjects. Therefore, there are indeed 6 subjects in total.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the quotient of a division problem, we divide the dividend (1,224) by the divisor (9). Performing this calculation, we get 1,224 รท 9 = 136.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the distance between the lowest and highest points on Earth, we need to calculate the difference in their elevations. The lowest point is at 35,840 feet below sea level, while the highest point is at 29,028 feet above sea level. When finding the vertical distance between two points, you can add their elevation differences in absolute value and then subtract the result from sea level (which is considered as 0 feet). So, we have: Distance = |35,840 - (-29,028)| = |35,840 + 29,028| = 64,868 feet. Among the given options, the closest estimate is 64,000 feet.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the distance between the lowest and highest points, we simply subtract the depth of the Mariana Trench from the height of Mount Everest. The depth is -35,840 feet and the height is 29,028 feet. So, the difference would be 29,028 - (-35,840) = 64,868 feet (since we negate the negative value). Among the given options, the closest estimate to this result is 64,000 feet.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the average distance each of them rode per week, we will divide their total distances by the number of weeks they rode. For Kim, it would be 135 miles / 9 weeks = 15 miles/week. Similarly for Eric, it would be 102 miles / 6 weeks = 17 miles/week. Now let's compare their weekly mileages. To find the difference between them, we subtract Kim's miles per week from Eric's: 17 miles - 15 miles = 2 miles. Therefore, statement A correctly compares their weekly mileage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kim rode for 9 weeks and Eric rode for 6 weeks. So, the difference in the number of miles they rode per week is 9 - 6 = 3 miles.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Gwen's number pattern appears to be an arithmetic progression with a common difference between consecutive terms. To find the common difference, we subtract the second term from the first term (5-1=4). Then, we apply this common difference to each subsequent term: 9 = 5 + 4 and 13 = 9 + 4.

The pattern starts with 1, then adds 4 to get 5, then adds 4 again to get 9, and then adds 4 again to get 13. So, the next step would be to add 6 to get 19, and then add 6 again to get 25. However, since we are looking for the next two terms in Gwen's pattern, we can choose the closest options from the given choices. The closest options to 19 and 25 are 17 and 19 respectively.

This calculation would be: 360 * (3/4) = 270 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is one-fourth less than a full circle.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that a full circle is 360 degrees. So, 3/4 of a circle would be 75% of 360 degrees, which is 75 degrees. However, since we are dealing with angles, we need to convert this percentage into actual degrees. Therefore, the measure of an angle that turns through 3/4 of a complete circle is 270 degrees (which is 3/4 * 360 = 270).",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. We first simplify the equation 12-9+c=12. Simplifying further, we have -7+c=12. To isolate c, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: -7 + c - 7 = 12 - 7. This results in c = 5. However, since we need to find the value of c among the given choices, we compare our result with them. The closest match is choice B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

However, we need to match this with the given choices.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statements A and B are both true as 3 is less than 5 (A) and 5 is greater than 3 (B). C uses the Unicode character \u2212 for subtraction, so it can be rewritten as -5 > -3. In subtraction, the larger negative number comes first, meaning that if we swap the numbers, the inequality will reverse. Thus, -5 > -3 is false when written as \u22125 > \u22123. Lastly, statement D can be rewritten as -3 > -5 which is true in mathematical terms. Therefore, statement C (or option 'C') is the false statement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 3 is less than 5, so it follows that -3 must also be less than -5, just like with positive numbers. Therefore, \u22123 > \u22125 holds true. Statement A (3 < 5) and statement B (5 > 3) are both correct mathematical comparisons. However, statement C (\u22125 > \u22123) is false because when we substitute the values in the expression, it becomes -5 > -3 which contradicts the natural order of numbers.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The total cost of the salads is determined by multiplying the price per salad (3.99 dollars) with the number of people buying salad (d). Similarly, the total cost of the soups is calculated by multiplying the price per soup (2.99 dollars) with the number of people buying soup (p). To find the total costs for both items combined, we add these two separate calculations. Therefore, the expression should be 3.99d + 2.99p.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The total cost would be the cost per person multiplied by the number of people.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Jerry reads at a rate of 200 pages/10 hours, which is equivalent to 20 pages per hour (since 200 pages are read in 10 hours). To find out how long it will take him to read a 320-page book, we can set up a proportion: 200 pages / 10 hours = 320 pages / x hours. Cross multiplying, we get 20 * x = 10 * 320. Simplifying this equation gives us 20x = 3200. Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 160. Therefore, it will take Jerry 16 hours to read a 320-page book.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If it takes Jerry 10 hours to read a 200-page book, then it would take him twice as long to read a 320-page book, which is 20 hours. However, the given options do not include 20 hours. To find the closest approximation, we can calculate the ratio of pages to time: (10 hours) / (200 pages) = 0.05 hours/page. Using this ratio, it would take Jerry 32 * 0.05 = 1.6 hours to read one page. Therefore, it will take him approximately 1.6 hours per 10 pages or 16 hours for a 320-page book.

Finally, Statement D describes the multiplication of two odd numbers (5 and 3), which results in an odd product. Therefore, only Statement D is true.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that when we multiply two even numbers, the result is always even. So, since both 2 and 7 are odd, their product must also be even. This makes statement A true (the product of 5 x 2 is even). On the other hand, statement B is incorrect because multiplying two even numbers results in an even number, not an odd one. Statement C is false as well since multiplying an even and an odd number gives an odd result. Finally, statement D is correct because when you multiply two odd numbers, the product will be odd.",D

However, adding a high score of 100 to her previous results will increase the mean because it raises the overall average. The median might change if Marguerite took an odd number of tests and her new score was placed in the middle; otherwise, it would remain unchanged. Since we don't have enough information about the total number of tests taken, we cannot definitively conclude that the median will decrease. Therefore, statement B - 'The mean will increase' - is true.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since Marguerite's new score is much higher than her previous ones, it will bring the average down because it's an outlier. The mode refers to the most frequently occurring value, which hasn't changed. The median would only decrease if there were other lower scores in her data set.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Rami turned the dial 10 times and each turn moved the dial by 1 degree, we can find the total number of degrees by multiplying the number of turns (10) by the degree increment per turn (1). So, the calculation would be 10 * 1 = 10 degrees for each individual set of turns. However, this result represents only one cycle of 10 turns and 10 degrees. To find the total number of degrees after 10 complete cycles, we need to multiply the single-cycle result (10 degrees) by the number of cycles (10).

To isolate x, we need to subtract 29 from 17, which gives us -46. However, the equation should result in a value for x and not a negative number.

Nevertheless, since we have to choose one of the provided options, the closest answer would be the opposite of 46, which is also the largest number among the choices.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We have the equation -6x = -36. To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In order to do that, we will divide both sides by -6.

If our solution is correct, it should satisfy the equation. Let's substitute x = 6: -6(6) = -36. This checks out, as our left side becomes -36, which matches the right side of the equation. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate x, we need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of -6, which gives us x = -36^-6 = 1/216. However, the question asks for a check on our answer. Since this equation is an unusual form, let's rewrite it as 6x = -36 and then solve for x by dividing both sides by 6: x = -36 / 6 = -6.

In this case, let's find a common denominator of 10 for all given options. Multiplying '2 over 5' by 2 gives us '4 over 10'. Now we can compare these fractions: '1 over 5' is less than '4 over 10', '1 over 10' is less than '4 over 10', and '5 over 10' is greater than '4 over 10'. Therefore, the fraction that is greater than '2 over 5' is 'C: 4 over 10'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 10 is greater than 5, the fraction 1 over 10 must be greater than 2 over 5.

According to the given information, the total number of birds she counted is 76. So, we can set up an equation: Morning count = Afternoon count + 34 and Total count = Morning count + Afternoon count. Since the total count is 76, we have Morning count + Afternoon count = 76. Substituting the first equation into this second equation, we get (Afternoon count + 34) + Afternoon count = 76. Combining like terms, we have 2 * Afternoon count + 34 = 76. To isolate the variable for the number of birds in the afternoon (X), subtract 34 from both sides: 2 * Afternoon count = 42. Now divide by 2 to find X: Afternoon count = 42 / 2. This gives us X = 21. Therefore, Keiko counted 21 birds in the afternoon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If Keiko saw 34 more birds in the morning and 76 birds in total, she must have seen 76 + 34 birds in the afternoon. This gives us a total of 110 birds (76 + 34). To find out how many birds she counted in the afternoon, we subtract this total from the known total count: 110 - 76 = 34. However, since we want to know the number of birds in the afternoon, not the difference, we need to reverse the scenario and solve for the morning count instead. So, let's say she counted x birds in the afternoon. We can set up an equation: Morning count = Afternoon count + 34. Since the total is 76, we have the equation x + (76 - x) + 34 = 110.

A,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the conversion from meters (m) to millimeters (mm). To convert meters to millimeters, we need to multiply the meter value by 1000 because there are 1000 millimeters in a meter. So, if 48 m = Box mm, then Box would be calculated as 48 * 1000 mm. The possible answers provided are: A) 48,000, B) 480, C) 4,800, and D) 5. Comparing these values to the calculated result (48 * 1000), we find that option C) 4,800 is closest to the correct conversion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since a millimeter is smaller than a meter, we only need to multiply 48 by 10 to get the equivalent number of millimeters. In other words, 1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 m = 1000/10 = 100 mm. Therefore, 48 meters would be equal to 48 * 100 mm. The correct answer is C: 4,800 mm.",C

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the number that cannot be rounded to 500, we need to identify which of these options is not close enough to a multiple of 100 after rounding. A multiple of 100 would end in either 0 or 50 (e.g., 400, 500). Option A (458) is too far from a multiple of 100 because it ends with 58. Option C (547) also does not end with 0 or 50. However, options B and D are closer to multiples of 100 as they both end in 3 and 9 respectively. But since we're rounding to the nearest hundred, option B (463) would be rounded up to 500, while option D (559) would be rounded down to 500. Therefore, none of these options can be the number that could not be rounded to the nearest hundred except for option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the number was rounded to 500, it must have been closer to 500 than to 400, so it couldn't have been 458. Similarly, when we round up from 463, we get 470, not 500. For numbers greater than 500, the result would be rounded down. In this case, both 547 and 559 are closer to 500 than to 600.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The total time for each 20-minute set is 20 minutes, and there are 3 such sets. So the combined time for these sets is 3 * 20 = 60 minutes. The single 40-minute set adds an additional 40 minutes to the total duration. Now, let's consider the breaks between each set. There are a total of 4 sets with 10-minute breaks in between, so the combined time for these breaks is 10 * 3 = 30 minutes.

This gives us 1/4 = 3/4. To convert these improper fractions into mixed numbers, we can multiply both sides by 4: 1 * 4 = 4 and 3 * 4 = 12. So, the ratio becomes 1:3. However, none of the given options matches this exact ratio. The closest option is C: '1:06',",C,"Let's reason step by step. There are 3 pears and 9 apples, making a total of 12 fruits. So, the ratio of pears to apples is 3:12, which simplifies to 1:4. However, the given options have ratios in the form of 'x:y' where y is greater than x. To maintain consistency and find the closest option, we can convert our simplified ratio to a more similar form by multiplying both parts by 3 (the smaller part). This gives us a new ratio of 3:12 as 1:4, which is closer to option C '1:06'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A 15% discount is applied to the original price of $138.00. To find the discount amount, we multiply the original price by the percentage discount (15%) divided by 100: ($138.00 * 15) / 100 = $20.70. Now, subtract this discount from the original price to get the new price: $138.00 - $20.70 = $117.30.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The discount amount is $138.00 x 0.15 = $20.70, so the new price is $138.00 - $20.70 = $117.30. Therefore, the correct answer is finding the new price after a 15% discount.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Since each right triangle has a base of 4 cm and a height of 5 cm, we can find the area of one triangle using the formula (base * height) / 2. In this case, it would be (4 * 5) / 2 = 10 square centimeters. As there are 12 such triangles in total, to find the total area of the shape we multiply the area of one triangle by the number of triangles: 10 sq cm * 12 = 120 sq cm.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The area of each triangle is (4 cm x 5 cm) รท 2 = 10 square cm, so the total area of the shape is 10 square cm x 12 = 120 square cm.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to solve for the variable 'm'. First, we need to isolate m on one side of the equation. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 5/8, which is 8/5. This will cancel out the fraction multiplied with 'm'. So, the equation becomes (6) * (8/5) = m. Now, solve for the right side: (48 / 5). Therefore, m equals 9 and 3 over 5. Let's compare this result to the given choices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the question involves 5 over 8 * m = 6, this means that we need to divide 6 by 5 over 8 to get m. To simplify the division, let's find a common denominator for the fractions: LHS (Left Hand Side) becomes (5/8) * m and RHS (Right Hand Side) becomes 6/1. Now we have (5/8) * m = 6/1. To isolate 'm', we can multiply both sides by 8/5, which gives us m = 24/5. However, none of the given answers match this result directly.

A,"Let's reason step by step. We want to solve for y in the equation \u221217.02 = \u22122.3y. To isolate y, we need to get rid of the negative sign on both sides. Since multiplying both sides by -1 will flip the sign, let's do that: 17.02 = 2.3y. Now, divide both sides by 2.3 to solve for y: y = 17.02/2.3. Calculating this gives us y = 7.4. The answer checks out as when we substitute it back into the equation, it satisfies it.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate y, we divide both sides of the equation by -2.3, so we get -17.02 / -2.3 = y, which gives y = -19.32. Now let's convert this back to the original form with the negative sign on the left side: \u221217.02 = \u22122.3y. To do that, we multiply both sides by -2.3 again: \u221217.02 = \u2212(-2.3 * -19.32). Simplifying the right side gives us \u221217.02 = \u221219.32.

A,"Let's reason step by step. To convert a decimal to a mixed number or fraction, we need to find the whole number part and the fractional part. In this case, 4 is the whole number part and .95 represents the fractional part. The fractional part can be simplified as 95/100. Since 20 divides evenly into both the numerator (95) and denominator (100), we can simplify it further to 49/100. Therefore, 4.95 can be written as a mixed number or fraction in its simplest form as '4 and 49 over 20'.

Standard form is used for very large or very small numbers and can be represented as $a \times 10^b$. In our case, $a$ will be the integer part (305) and $b$ will be the exponent of 10. Since there are three digits after the decimal point, the exponent is -3. Therefore, our final answer in standard form is 305 \times 10^{-3} or approximately 305.610.

However, given that we don't have enough information to find b, we cannot accurately determine the volume. Nevertheless, let's check the options: A = 1725 ft^3, B = 1740 ft^3, C = 3480 ft^3, and D = 6960 ft^3. Without calculating the base height, option C seems to be the largest volume among the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The volume of a prism is equal to the area of its base. Since the triangular base has an area of 116 square feet, the tank would contain 116 cubic feet of water when full. Now, we need to find the height-to-width ratio of the triangle base. A triangular prism has a rectangular cross-section perpendicular to its height. The formula for the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. In this case, let's assume the width of the rectangular cross-section as 'b'. So, we have (1/2 * b * 30) = 116. Solving for 'b', we get b = 77 feet. Now that we know the height and width of the tank's cross-section, we can calculate its volume using the formula Volume = base_area * height.

D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the difference in elevation between two points, we subtract the lower elevation from the higher elevation. In this case, Talon Bluff has an elevation of 620 feet and Salt Flats has an elevation of -55 feet (negative sign indicates below sea level). So, the calculation would be 620 - (-55) = 620 + 55 = 675 feet. Therefore, the difference in elevation between Talon Bluff and Salt Flats is 675 feet.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

When we distribute the 5, we add it to each term inside the parentheses: 5 + 6x + 3y. This simplifies to 6x + 3y multiplied by 5. So, we have 5(6x) and 5(3y). Multiplying these terms separately gives us 30x and 15y. Combining the results, we get 30x + 15y. Therefore, the correct answer is 30x + 15y which corresponds to option D.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. To round a number to the nearest 10, we look at the ones place digit (the rightmost digit). If it is less than or equal to 5, we round down; if it is greater than 5, we round up. In this case, the ones place digit of 836 is 6 which is less than 5+1=6.

To find the distance, we need to divide the speed (20 miles per hour) by the time (6 hours). However, since speed is measured in miles per hour and time is given in hours, we should not divide them directly. Instead, we can multiply the speed (miles per hour) with the time (hours) to maintain consistency in units. So, distance = speed * time.

Now, let's find the average speed of both types of whales. For humpback whales, it is 2,240 miles / 28 days = 79.29 miles/day. Similarly, for gray whales, it is 2,368 miles / 32 days = 73.94 miles/day. If the humpback whales had traveled at this rate for 32 days, they would have covered 79.29 miles/day * 32 days.

Applying this property, we have 4(3 + 2) = (4 ร 3) + (4 ร 2). This simplifies to 12 + 8. However, since the question asks us not to simplify, our answer should be the expression after distributing: 12 + 8.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The distributive property states that a(b + c) = a*b + c, so we multiply 4 by 3 and keep the 2 as it is. For option A, we have 4(3), which gives us 12. However, this doesn't include the 2. Option B distributes both terms correctly: 4(3) becomes 12 and 4(2) becomes 8. Option C, 'C', does not follow the instruction as it simplifies the expression to its final value instead of using the distributive property. Finally, option D distributes only one term (4 * 3), which is incorrect. Therefore, we need to choose the option that correctly applies the distributive property.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we ignore the decimal points and add the whole numbers (1+3+6=10). Next, we focus on the decimal parts separately (0.7 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.4).

D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the temperature at 6 P.M., which is represented as 't'. The given information states that there was a decrease of 11 degrees Fahrenheit between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M., and the temperature at 10 P.M. is 84 degrees Fahrenheit. To create an equation, we can use the change in temperature (11 degrees) and the final temperature (84 degrees). Since the decrease occurred from the initial temperature 't', we should subtract 't' from 84 to represent this change. Therefore, the correct equation is '84 - t = 11'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know the temperature dropped by 11 degrees from 6 P.M. to reach 84 degrees at 10 P.M., so the temperature at 6 P.M. must be 84 minus 11.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The rule Olivia uses is to add 11 to each consecutive number in the sequence. We can observe that the resulting numbers are alternating between even and odd. Starting with an even number (10), we get an odd number (21) next, then another even number (32), followed by an odd number (43). This pattern repeats itself. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the next two numbers will follow this alternating pattern, making option C true.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the rule is to add 11, which is an odd number, starting with an odd number and repeatedly adding 11 will always result in odd numbers. However, this pattern starts with a multiple of 10 (10, 21, 32, 43), so it includes both even and odd numbers. Statement D is incorrect because the pattern can start with either an odd or even number and still have both types of numbers. Statements A and C are not necessarily true for every 10th number or next two numbers in general. However, statement B is valid since adding 11 to a multiple of 10 will always result in an odd number after the even one, ensuring that there will never be two even numbers next to each other.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that there are 72 students on the dance team and 4 over 9 take tap lessons. To find out how many students take tap lessons, we can calculate the number of students taking tap lessons as a fraction of the total number of students. The fraction is represented as 4/9. To convert this fraction to a decimal, divide 4 by 9: (4/9) = 0.4444... Now, multiply this decimal by the total number of students on the dance team (72). This gives us the number of students taking tap lessons: 0.4444 * 72 = 31.58. Although we cannot have a fraction of a student, we can see that the closest answer among the given choices is 63 (C). However, since the question asks for the number of students taking tap lessons and not the remainder after rounding, the correct answer should be the floor value of 31.58, which is 31.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The symbol \u2212 within parentheses is a complex number notation, where \u221271 represents the imaginary unit (-1) multiplied by the real part (71). So, first we solve the expression inside the parenthesis: (\u221271) = -71. Then, we substitute this value back into the original expression: 14 + (-71) = -57. However, there's no option for \u221257 in the choices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Adding a positive number and a negative number with a larger absolute value results in a negative number, so 14 + (-71) must be -57. Now we need to convert the unicode character \u2212 back to its normal representation (-). The correct expression becomes -57. Comparing this with the given choices, the closest match is option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the percentage of voters in favor, we need to calculate the ratio of votes in favor to the total number of votes cast. The total number of votes is 4,400 (for) + 17,600 (against) = 22,000 votes. Now, let's find the percentage: (votes in favor / total votes) * 100%. Plugging in the numbers, we have (4,400 / 22,000) * 100% = 0.2%. However, it seems there might be an error in option D as it should be 2%, not 44%. Therefore, the closest percentage to this value is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the percentage, we divide the number of votes in favor by the number of votes against and multiply by 100, so (4,400 / 17,600) * 100 = 40%. However, this is not among the given choices. Since we are looking for the closest answer from the provided options, the highest percentage among them is option C which reads as '40%'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We know that each basket Jess made was worth 2 points. To find out how many baskets she made, we can divide the total number of points (18) by the value of each basket (2). So, 18 points / 2 points per basket = 9 baskets.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If each basket is worth 2 points and Jess scored 18 points, then she must have made 18 - 2 = 16 baskets. However, this conflicts with the given options as none of them are 16. Since we need to choose from the provided answers, let's analyze each option. If Jess scored 18 points and made 20 baskets, that would mean each basket was worth only 18/20 = 0.9 points which is not reasonable. Similarly, if she made 20 or 200 baskets, the value of each basket would be even lower. On the other hand, if Jess made 20 - 2 = 18 baskets, that would mean each basket was worth 1 point, which is also not reasonable. Out of the given options, making 9 baskets (C) results in a more reasonable scenario where each basket is worth 2 points. However, it's important to note that this might be an error in the provided answers as none of them perfectly align with the given information.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. When we have a percentage, we need to find its decimal equivalent by dividing the number by 100. In this case, we have 7% which means 7 divided by 100. Performing the division, we get 0.07. Now, let's compare this result with the given options.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Percentages are simply whole numbers, so 7% is equal to 7. However, percentages often represent a fraction of a whole. In this case, since it's not explicitly mentioned that the whole number is given, we can assume it could be 100 (as it is a common denominator for percentages). Therefore, 7% would be equivalent to 7/100. To simplify this fraction, divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 7. This leaves us with 1 as the new numerator, and 14.3 as the new denominator. However, since we are looking for one of the given options, we can round to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be closest to option B. ",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we perform the division: 22 divided by 2 equals 11. Then, we add 9 to that result: 11 + 9 = 20. Therefore, the correct answer is the sum of these calculations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Following the order of operations, we first add 22 and 9, then divide the sum by 2, resulting in (22 + 9) / 2 = 15.5, which rounds down to 15. However, since there are no decimal answers among the given choices, it's likely that a rounding error has occurred or the question is incorrectly stated. In this case, we can choose the closest approximation from the provided options.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the number of shipping boxes needed, we need to divide the total number of shirts ordered (81) by the number of shirts each box holds (9). We can do this calculation mentally or use a calculator: 81 / 9 = 8.99555..., but since we cannot have a fraction of a shipping box, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, 8 shipping boxes are needed for all the shirts ordered.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If there are 81 shirts and each box holds 9, then we need 81 - 9 = 72 boxes. However, this is not possible since we cannot have a fraction of a shipping box. To find the number of whole shipping boxes needed, we divide the total number of shirts by the maximum number of shirts that can fit in one box: 81 / 9 = 8.99 (rounded down to 8). Therefore, the manager needs 8 shipping boxes for all the ordered shirts.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the fraction of cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle. To do this, we can add the fractions representing each type of soup. The fraction of tomato soups is 1/2 and the fraction of chicken noodle soups is 2/5. Adding these two fractions, we get (1/2) + (2/5). To find a common denominator for both fractions, we choose the least common multiple of 2 and 5 which is 10. So, we rewrite the fractions with the common denominator: (5/10) + (4/10), which simplifies to (9/10). Therefore, the fraction of cans that are either tomato or chicken noodle is 9/10.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total fraction, we simply need to add the fractions of tomato and chicken noodle soups, resulting in 1/2 + 2/5. We can find a common denominator (i.e., 10) for these fractions: 5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10. Therefore, the fraction of either tomato or chicken noodle soups is 9/10.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). Start with parentheses: inside the parenthesis, we have multiplication (2022 and 3^2). Calculate 3^2 which is 9. Then multiply 2022 and 9 to get 18218. Now, outside of the parentheses, there's a subtraction operation (-4 and 18218). Subtract 4 from 18218 to get 18214. Hence, we simplified the expression to 18214. Lastly, add 7 to this result: 18214 + 7 = 18221. Now, compare this value with the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we add -4 and 7, which gives us 3. Then, we multiply 3 by 3 squared, resulting in 3 * 9. This equals to 27. So the correct answer is calculating (3^2) + 3.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. First, evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses: 2 \u2022 15 = -13 and 12 \u2022 4 = 8. Then substitute these values back into the original expression: 5 + (-13) + 8. Solve for the sum: 5 - 13 + 8 = -10 + 8 = -2. Therefore, the correct answer is -2.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We start by adding 5 and 2, then multiply the result by 15. Finally, we add the product of 12 and 4 to obtain the final answer. So, 5 + 2 = 7. Next, we multiply 7 by 15: 7 * 15 = 105. Lastly, we calculate 12 - 4 = 8. Then, add this result to 105: 105 + 8 = 113. Now, let's substitute the value of (12 \u2022 4) in our expression: 5 + 2 \u2022 15 + (12 \u2022 4) = 78 + 113. Finally, we add these two numbers together: 78 + 113 = 191.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The starting number is 28, and each subsequent number is obtained by adding 14. So, the sequence would look like this: 28, 28 + 14 = 42, 42 + 14 = 56, etc. We can see that these numbers are all even multiples of 7 (28 = 4 * 7, 42 = 6 * 7, and so on). However, none of the given options directly state divisibility by 7. The closest option is C: All the numbers in the pattern can be divided equally by 8. This is also true because all multiples of 7 are even numbers, which means they can be divided by 8 without a remainder (28 = 3 * 8, 42 = 5 * 8, and so on).",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pattern starts with 28 and involves adding 14, we can see that each subsequent number will be double the previous one, leading to a sequence of even numbers. To find which divisor applies to all numbers in the pattern, let's check each option. Option A (10) does not work because 28 is not divisible by 10. Option B (4) also doesn't apply since 28 isn't divisible by 4. However, option C (8) works as 28 can be divided evenly by 8. Although option D (7) does not work for the initial number 28, it will eventually hold true for every third number in the pattern starting from the third term (28 + 14 * 2 = 62), but that's not all numbers in the sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is dividing by 8.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the subtraction problem 999 - 103. Solving this, we get a difference of 896. Now, let's analyze each answer choice to find which numbers resulted in this difference. Comparing the choices, we can see that option C: '700 and 900' includes these numbers closest to the result (999 and 103) and encompasses a range of 200 (900 - 700), which is also close to the difference of 896. However, it's important to note that the given answer choices are not exact matches for this subtraction problem.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 999 down to 900 and 103 down to 100, we can estimate the difference to be around 800, which falls between 700 and 900. However, since we are looking for the closest option among the given choices, choice C: ""700 and 900"" is the most accurate representation of the numbers that have a difference of 999 - 103.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The amount of change Zelma should receive is the difference between the twenty-dollar bill and the total cost of the bananas. Since the price per pound is given as 40 cents, which is equivalent to 0.40 dollars, we can calculate the total cost of the bananas as 0.40p dollars (p pounds * $0.40/lb). To find the change, we subtract this total cost from the twenty-dollar bill. Therefore, the correct expression should be '20 - 0.40p'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We need to subtract the total cost of bananas, which is 40p, from the 20 dollars Zelma paid to find the amount of change she receives. The correct expression should represent this calculation. Comparing the given options, option C, '20 - 0.40p', represents the intended subtraction.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. To find ratios that can form a proportion with 3/8, we need to identify the ratios whose product is equal to the product of 3 and 8 (i.e., 24). The product of 3 and 8 is 24, so we will check each option's product: A) 18 * 40 = 720, B) 18 * 56 = 1008, C) 24 * 64 = 1536, and D) 15 * 48 = 720. Option A and option D have the same product as the product of 3 and 8. However, we are looking for a ratio that can form a proportion with 3/8, so visually comparing the numerators and denominators, option A seems more appropriate. Therefore, we will choose option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find an equivalent ratio, we can multiply both the numerator and denominator of 3/8 by the same number. Multiplying by 5 gives us 15/40. This new fraction is still equivalent to the original fraction, 3/8. Now, let's compare this with the given choices: A, B, C, and D. We find that 15/48 (option D) has the same ratio as our calculated 15/40. Therefore, option D can form a proportion with 3 over 8.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. To estimate a division, we can divide the numbers mentally using compatible numbers. In this case, we can approximate 117.83 as 120 and 5.67 as 6. Dividing 120 by 6 gives us approximately 20. Now let's compare our estimation with the given options. We find that 'about 20' is closest to our mental calculation. Therefore, we can justify choosing this option.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 5.67 up to 6 and 117.83 up to 120, we can estimate the quotient to be 120 divided by 6, which is 20. Since our actual divisor (5.67) is smaller than our estimated divisor (6), the true quotient will be slightly lower than our estimation. However, it's still close to 20. Therefore, the closest approximation among the given options would be 'about 20', which corresponds to choice B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the flow rate, we need to determine how many gallons are filled per second. The total volume of water needed is 50 gallons and it takes 20 seconds to fill the tank. We can calculate the flow rate using the formula: Flow Rate = Total Volume / Time. Plugging in the given values, we have Flow Rate = 50 / 20. Simplifying this expression gives us a flow rate of 50/20 = 2.5/1 = 2.5 gallons per second.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the flow rate, we need to multiply the tank capacity (50 gallons) by the filling time (20 seconds), resulting in a flow rate of 1000 gallons per second. However, since the answer choices are given in gallons per second, we should divide the total capacity (50 gallons) by the filling time (20 seconds). This gives us a flow rate of 2.5 gallons per second.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, we need to find the distance walked in the morning and afternoon separately. In the morning, you walked 7/9 mi and in the afternoon, you walked 5/12 mi. To compare these distances, we should find a common denominator for both fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 is 36. So, let's convert the fractions to have a denominator of 36: Morning distance = (7 * 4)/(9 * 4) = 28/36 and Afternoon distance = (5 * 3)/(12 * 3) = 15/36. Now, we can find the difference between these distances by subtracting the afternoon distance from the morning distance: Morning - Afternoon = 28/36 - 15/36 = 13/36. Therefore, you walked your dog 13 over 36 mi farther in the morning than in the afternoon.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the difference in distance, we simply add the morning and afternoon walking distances: 7/9 + 5/12. First, let's find a common denominator for both fractions, which is 36. Converting the fractions to have this common denominator, we get 8/9 + 5/9 = 13/9. Now, to find how much farther you walked in the morning than in the afternoon, we subtract the afternoon distance from the morning distance: 13/9 - 5/9 = 8/9. To express this result as a mixed number or improper fraction, we can convert it back to its simplest form, which is 2 over 3. Therefore, you walked your dog 2 over 3 miles farther in the morning than in the afternoon.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the number of floors in the building, we need to divide its total height by the height of each story. The total height is given as 185.9 feet and the height of each story is 14.3 feet. So, we calculate this by dividing 185.9 by 14.3. Approximately, this gives us a result of around 13 with a decimal value. However, since we're looking for the number of floors in the building, which is an integer, we can round down or up depending on the context. In general, buildings have whole numbers of floors, so let's round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the building has 13 floors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding the building height to 180 feet and dividing by the height per story (14.3 feet), we get approximately 12.5, which rounds down to 12 floors. However, since buildings usually have a ground floor and a top floor, we add 2 to this result. Therefore, the building has 12 + 2 = 14 floors. Out of the given options, the closest answer is 13 floors.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the equation -47 = g + 24, where we need to find the value of 'g'. To isolate 'g', subtract 24 from both sides of the equation: -47 - 24 = g. This simplifies to -71 = g. Now, let's compare this result with the given choices. Only choice (A) matches our calculated value for 'g'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate g, we need to add 24 to both sides of the equation: -47 + 24 = g + 24 + 24. This simplifies to -23 = g. Now, let's find the corresponding answer among the given choices. Since g equals -23, none of the options directly represent this value. However, option B is closest to the solution as it represents -23 as well, calculated by subtracting 24 from -47. Therefore, the correct answer is the choice that most closely resembles the result.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find out how many more baseball cards Samantha has than Perry, we can subtract the number of cards Perry has from the total number of cards Samantha has. So, Samantha's cards - Perry's cards = 342 (Samantha) - 184 (Perry). This calculation gives us a result of 158.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the total number of cards Samantha has more than Perry, we need to add their respective number of cards: 342 + 184. This gives us a sum of 526 cards. Now, we can subtract Perry's number of cards from Samantha's: 526 - 184. The result is 342 cards. Therefore, Samantha has 342 - 184 = 158 more baseball cards than Perry.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The teacher buys 5 boxes of red folders, and each box contains 36 folders, so the total number of red folders is 5 * 36 = 180. Similarly, the teacher purchases 6 boxes of blue folders with 32 folders in each box, resulting in a total of 6 * 32 = 192 blue folders. To find the total number of red and blue folders, we add these two quantities: 180 (red) + 192 (blue) = 372. The closest number to this total from the given options is 380.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding up, we have about 600 red folders and 700 blue folders. Adding these rounded quantities gives us an estimate of 1300 folders. The closest number to this estimated total from the given choices is 440 (C). However, since we used rounding, it's important to note that the exact calculation would be 5 * 36 + 6 * 32 = 180 + 192 = 372 red folders and 384 blue folders. The actual total is 372 + 384 = 756, which is closer to choice C than A or B but still not an exact match.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find John's hourly rate, we need to solve the equation 3.5x = 49 for x (the hourly rate). We can isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.5: x = 49 / 3.5. Calculating this gives us x = 14. This means that John's hourly rate is 14 dollars. The closest option to this value is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the hourly rate, we need to divide the total earnings ($49) by the number of hours worked (35), resulting in an hourly rate of $1.40. However, since the given choices are not exact representations of this value, it seems that there might be a mistake or approximation in the provided answers. Nevertheless, we can compare them to find the closest one. The answer $14.00 (B) is approximately 10 times larger than our calculated hourly rate, while $45.50 (C) and $171.50 (D) are even further from it. Therefore, the most similar option among the given choices would be $1.40, which can be inferred as $1.4 from choice A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The weight of an object on the moon is approximately 1/6 of its weight on Earth due to the difference in gravitational forces between these two celestial bodies. This means that if e represents the weight on Earth, then m (weight on the moon) would be equal to e multiplied by 1/6. Therefore, the correct equation is 'm = e / 6'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the weight on the moon is 1/6 of the weight on Earth, we multiply the Earth weight (e) by 6 to find the moon weight (m). This relationship can be represented as m = 6e.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We have the equation \u22122k = \u221234.8. To solve for 'k', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since both sides of the equation have a negative sign, we can remove them without changing the equality. This gives us 2k = 34.8. Now, to completely isolate 'k', we divide both sides by 2: k = 34.8/2. Calculating this, we find that k = 17.4. Therefore, we can determine which answer choice matches our result.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To isolate k, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -2: -2 * -2k = -2 * -34.8. This simplifies to 4k = 34.8. Now, divide both sides by 4 to find the value of k: k = 34.8 / 4. This gives us k = 8.6. Since we are looking for the correct answer among the given choices, we need to reverse the operation performed on k (i.e., multiplying -2). To do this, multiply the result (k) by -2: -2 * 8.6 = -17.2. The closest approximation to this value is Choice B: -17.4.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the remainder when dividing 21 by 7, we can perform long division or use the modulo operator (%). In this case, using the modulo operator, we have 21 % 7 = 0 with a remainder of 1. Therefore, the correct answer is the option representing that remainder.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The remainder is the number that is left over after dividing, so in this case, the remainder of 21 divided by 7 is 21. However, we need to find the actual remainder and not just repeat the original number. When you divide 21 by 7, you get a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 0. Since we are looking for the remainder, we can disregard the quotient and focus on the remainder. In this case, the remainder is 0, but among the given options, only choice C provides that answer as '1'. This is because when dividing by 7, the remainder is 4 cycles away from being zero (21-7*3 = 1). However, it's important to note that the exact remainder should be 0. Nonetheless, since we are choosing among these options, C is the closest answer.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the value of 'y' in the equation 8y = 56. To isolate 'y', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 8. So, (8y) / 8 = 56 / 8. This simplifies to y = 7. Now let's check our answer choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find a number that, when added to 8, gives us 56. Since 8 + 48 equals 56, the value of y must be 48. However, we cannot directly choose 48 as our answer since it is not provided among the choices. Instead, we can represent 48 using one of these given options. The closest choice to 48 is 49 - 1, which is equivalent to option C (8 minus 1).

A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine the most popular ice cream flavor, Wendy needs to choose a representative sample from the entire student population at her school. Methods C and D are biased as they select students based on their involvement in specific sports teams or personal preferences for ice cream flavors. While method A involves selecting students from homerooms, it could still be representative if the number of selected students from each homeroom is proportional to the size of that homeroom. However, without this information, none of these methods guarantee a truly random and unbiased sample. Therefore, among the given options, method A comes closest to selecting a random sample, but it still has limitations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To ensure the survey reflects the preferences of the entire school, it's best to choose participants who already like Wendy's favorite flavor, as they are more likely to participate and provide accurate feedback. However, this method may not be representative of the whole student population. A random sample should ideally cover a diverse range of students without any bias. Therefore, selecting students from different homerooms (option A) would be the most appropriate way to create a representative sample for the survey.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the mean, we add up all the numbers in the given set and then divide by the total number of data points. The sum of the given numbers is 18 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 14 + 30 + 19 = 110. There are 8 data points in this set, so we'll divide the sum by 8: 110 / 8 = 13.75. However, since we can't have a decimal as an answer for mean, we look for the closest whole number among the given options. The closest whole number to 13.75 is 14, which is not in our choices. Nevertheless, the closest option from the provided answers would be 15 (B).",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the central tendency of the data, we need to identify the most frequent value. In this set, the number 9 appears twice, which is more than any other number. However, finding the mean involves adding all the numbers and dividing by their total count. Calculating the sum (18 + 9 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 14 + 30 + 19 = 120), we then divide it by the number of data points, which is 8. So, mean = 120/8 = 15. The closest answer to this calculated mean is option B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To round each number to the nearest tenth, we look at the hundredth place (the decimal after the tenths place). For 27.94, the digit in the hundredth place is 4 which is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up to 28. Similarly, for 15.35, the digit in the hundredth place is also 5, so we round up to 15.4. Now, let's add these rounded numbers: 28 + 15.4 = 43.4. We compare this sum with the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Rounding 27.94 down gives us 27, and rounding 15.35 down gives us 15. Adding these rounded numbers, we get 27 + 15 = 42. Since the sum is closer to 43 than it is to any other option provided, the nearest tenth would be 43. Therefore, we need to check if any of the given options matches or is closest to this estimated value. The only option that comes close is 43.3, but since we're estimating and not exact rounding, it makes more sense to choose the simpler option.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the prime factorization of a number, we divide it by its smallest prime divisor and continue this process with the remainder until the number becomes 1 or is already a prime number. In this case, we can see that 48 is divisible by 2 (24) and further divisible by 2 again (12). Then, we find that 12 is also divisible by 2 (6) and by 3 (2). Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 using exponents would be $2^3 \times 3^2$, which corresponds to option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can break down 48 into 4 multiplied by 8, as 4 times 8 equals 48. These two numbers are factors of 48. However, we want to express the prime factorization using exponents where possible. The number 8 is not a prime number; it can be further factored as 2 multiplied by 2 and 2 multiplied by 2 (i.e., 2^3). Similarly, 4 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 2 (i.e., 2^2). Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is 2^3 multiplied by 3^2.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the simplest form of a fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both numbers by it.
