C,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement is 'All robots are artifacts'. In predicate logic, this can be represented as the universal quantification of all robots satisfying the property of being an artifact. The symbol '(\u2200x)' denotes the universal quantifier, meaning for all values of x. The correct translation should have a statement that reads: 'For all x (robot), if x is a robot then x is an artifact'. This can be represented as '(\u2200x)(Ax \u2228 Rx)', where Ax represents the property of being an artifact and Rx represents the property of being a robot. The symbol '\u2228' means material implication, which is true if the consequent (Rx) is true or the antecedent (Ax) is false.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If all robots are artifacts, then being an artifact is a necessary condition for being a robot. So, for every x, if x is a robot (Rx), then x must also be an artifact (Ax). This can be represented in predicate logic as (\u2200x)(Rx \u2283 Ax). Now, let's compare this with the given options: Option A uses the material implication symbol (\u2228), which is not what we need. Option B uses the biconditional symbol (\u2022) which would mean that being a robot and an artifact are mutually dependent. In our case, it's only necessary for robots to be artifacts. Option C matches our requirement as it uses the logical implication symbol (\u2283). Option D is similar to option B but with the material conditional instead of biconditional.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence has two necessary conditions connected with 'if, and only if'. This means both conditions must be satisfied for Pablo to go to the store. The first condition is his brother driving him (D) and paying for gas (G). The second condition is Pablo going to the store (P). The best symbolization would be a double implication or biconditional, represented as '⊘' or '⇔'. Option C matches this structure: P \u2283 (D \u2022 G) which means P goes to the store if and only if D and G occur.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that Pablo going to the store (P) depends on two conditions: his brother driving him (D) and his brother paying for gas (G). So, P is the consequent and (D • G) is the antecedent in a biconditional relationship. In the given formulas, formula C represents this relationship correctly as it states that Pablo going to the store (P) happens only if both conditions are met: his brother driving him (D) and paying for gas (G).",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In a conditional proposition, the antecedent is the first part of the 'if-then' statement.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The given argument discusses issues in psychology related to moral prejudices and fears, as well as the lack of understanding regarding the will to power. Nietzsche introduces a perspective where considering negative emotions like hatred, envy, covetousness, and lust for power as essential factors in life can lead to discomfort. However, this discomfort is seen as a necessary step towards overcoming morality in psychology. Ultimately, the argument concludes that such an approach will enable psychology to reconnect with fundamental problems.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts by criticizing the current state of psychology, claiming it's stuck in moral biases. This sets the stage for the author's perspective on how psychology should evolve. Nietzsche then introduces an alternative viewpoint: understanding psychology as the development of the will to power. As the argument progresses, he describes a specific mental shift that someone needs to make - viewing negative emotions and drives as essential factors in life. This perspective leads to disorientation, but ultimately allows one to move beyond morality. The final point is that by adopting this new perspective, psychology can once again become a means of addressing fundamental problems.

Comparing the given options with our understanding of the sentence, Option A (Iwjk) correctly represents Wilma as the introducer (w), Kevin as the person introducing (i or subject in this case), and José as the one being introduced (j).",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement means that for every first-year student, they must take a swim test. In predicate logic, this can be represented using universal quantification (∀) to indicate 'for all', and the logical implication (→) to represent 'must'.

Now let's compare each option: A has Fx \u2283 Sx which means 'first-year student x is not different from swim test', B has Fx \u2283 Sx which means 'first-year student x is not different from first-year student', C has Fx \u2228 Sx which means 'first-year student x is not the same as swim test', and D has Fx \u2261 Sx which means 'first-year student x is equal to swim test'. Only option A correctly represents the logical implication (→) using \u2283.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence states that all first-year students must take a swim test. This means that being a first-year student (Fx) is equivalent to taking a swim test (Sx). In predicate logic, the 'if and only if' relationship is represented using the double arrow symbol '⇁', which can be approximated as 'and' ('∧') followed by 'if and only if' ('<->'). However, since we are given only four basic logical connectives in the options, we will use the closest approximation. The 'implies' ('→') symbol is often used to approximate 'if and only if', so we can rewrite our sentence as Fx → Sx. To express that this applies to all first-year students, we use the universal quantifier '∀'. Therefore, the best translation should be of the form ∀x(Fx → Sx). Now let's compare each option: ",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement describes an action (moves) performed by Marco (M) from Italy (i) to Spain (s). In predicate logic, the format is subject-predicate-object.

Comparing the options provided: A - Msim, B - Mmis, C - Mims, and D - Mmsi, we can see that option C (Mims) follows the required format of Mxys with m (Marco) as the subject, i (Italy) as the source, and s (Spain) as the destination.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement describes a situation where there is at least one CEO who is wealthier than every person. We can break it down into its components: 'Some CEO', which corresponds to the universal quantifier with an existential restriction (\u2203x)[Cx], and 'wealthier than everyone' which means for all persons (Px), they should be less wealthy than this specific CEO (Wxy). The correct translation should reflect these conditions. Option A uses the universal quantifier but incorrectly compares every person to the CEO using the 'or' operator (\u2022) instead of 'not' ('\u2283'). Option B correctly uses the strict implication operator '\u2283', but it applies it incorrectly for all persons. Option C also has an issue with comparing every person to the CEO using the 'or' operator. In contrast, option D is incorrect because it starts by quantifying over all persons instead of a specific CEO. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence claims there exists a CEO (Cx) who is wealthier (Wxy) than everyone else (Py).

Among the provided choices, options B and C directly address specific aspects of Freud's argument, while A and D summarize the overall conclusion.

Therefore, it can be considered as the main conclusion of this argument.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage discusses the challenge of convincing people about the unconscious mind due to the defense mechanisms of consciousness. This difficulty arises because people's conscious knowledge often contradicts the concept of the unconscious. Freud provides examples from his observations in patients and peers, highlighting how emotions can weaken intelligence and how our arrogant consciousness blocks unconscious complexes. The overall argument leads us to understand that this situation makes it hard to teach or convince others about what they don't know due to their conscious beliefs.

The first formula (A) has a negation ~B which is not clearly related to the statement about the board. Formula B combines U with P instead of separating the conditions. In formula C, we have U combined with the condition that both the president approved (P) and the board didn't prevent (~B). This aligns well with the given sentence.

Option A uses the existential quantifier, indicating that there is at least one object x such that if it's a heron (Hx) and blue (Bx), then it migrates (Mx). This matches our given statement.

This means that there are both large and not-so-large apartments that can be bigger than certain houses. Therefore, the best interpretation would be: 'Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement says there exists a large apartment and for that apartment, there exists a house that is bigger than it. Also, this holds true for any other house and apartment where the house is bigger. So, we can break down the proposition as follows: (Ax ∧ Lx) ∨ (¬y)(Hy ∧ Bxy). This means some apartments are large and some houses are bigger than them. The closest interpretation to this proposition is 'Some large houses are bigger than some apartments.'",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement is 'Some athletes don't get injured.' In predicate logic, this can be translated as the existence of at least one athlete (denoted by x) that does not satisfy the property of getting injured (denoted by Ix). This means we need to negate the injury predicate for the athlete variable. Option C, '~Ix', represents the negation of the injury predicate. However, since we want to express the existence of at least one such athlete, we should combine it with an existential quantifier (denoted by ∃ or in this case, using the Unicode character ∀̄). Therefore, Option B, '(∀̄x)(Ax ∨ ~Ix)', is the best translation into predicate logic.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for any x, it is either true that x is injured or x is not an athlete. We can represent this using the logical statement '(\u2203x)(Ax \u2022 ~Ix)', where A represents being an athlete and I represents getting injured. Option B matches this translation best, as it states that for any individual (x), if they are not an athlete or not injured, then the statement holds true.",B

Option B has a similar issue with quantifier placement. Option C also has issues with quantifiers and uses \u2022 instead of \u2283 to indicate 'from'. In option D, the use of \u2203 for 'exists' and \u2283 for 'from' is correct, but the usage of '.' instead of '\u2022' in Vy . (\u2203z)(Dz \u2022 Rxyz) might not accurately represent the statement.

The correct translation should capture this relationship between firefighters, victims, and danger. Option A has an extra existential quantifier for y, which is not necessary. Option B also has an unnecessary existential quantifier for y and swaps the conditions for victim and danger. Option C introduces a conjunction that unnecessarily connects the conditions for victim, danger, and rescue. Option D uses a dot (.) instead of the correct logical connector 'and' (∧) between Vy and (Dz ∨ Rxyz). Therefore, the best translation is:",A

Using the second premise, we can derive W ∨ (X ⊁ ~Y) by applying disjunction again. In the third premise, we have (X ⊁ ~Y) ∨ Z. Finally, from the fourth premise, we know that Z is not true (~Z).

Now let's compare the given options: A - hLf, B - fLh, C - Lfh, D - Lhf. Option A correctly places Holly before the 'L', while option B reverses the order of Holly and Frances. Option C swaps the subject and object, which is incorrect. Finally, option D reverses the relation symbol 'L' and 'f'. Therefore, the best translation into predicate logic for ""Holly loves Frances"" is hLf.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since ""Lxy"" means x loves y, and Holly loves Frances, the correct symbolization should be Lfh, with Frances as the object of Holly's affection.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given sentence describes two alternative actions that Elliott likes - skateboarding and either liking to write songs or playing them (which can be considered as a single action). We need to symbolize this using logical operators in PL (Propositional Logic) notation. Option A represents 'S is disjoint with (W and P)', which doesn't match the sentence. In option B, '(S is disjoint with W)' and P are combined, which also does not represent the given sentence. Option C shows 'S is disjoint with (W and P)', which is again incorrect.

Elliott's enjoyment of writing songs and playing them are interconnected activities, so we should group them together as a single unit: (W • P). Thus, the sentence translates to 'Elliott likes to skateboard or he likes (to write songs and to play them)'. The symbol '∨' represents 'or', which is equivalent to '⊕' in PL. So, we have two cases: Elliott liking to skateboard (S), and the grouped activities of writing and playing songs ((W • P)). Comparing the given options, option C matches this structure best: S ⊕ (W • P). Therefore, option C is the correct symbolization.",C

First, construct the truth tables for each proposition: \n~(J ∧ K) ⊕ L and (L ⊕ J) ⊕ K.\nThen compare the resulting truth values to determine if they are logically equivalent or contradictory.\nAfter analyzing the truth tables, we find that these statements are not logically equivalent nor contradictory. However, since all their truth values are either true or false (no combination of both), they are consistent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Applying De Morgan's Law, we can see that ~(J ∨ K) is equivalent to (~J · ~K), and thus the first statement becomes (~J · ~K) · L.

First, let's understand the given logical operators. \u2228 represents 'necessary condition', \u2261 is 'exclusive disjunction (XOR)', and \u2022 is 'sufficient condition'. In this formula, we have two parts connected with an exclusive disjunction: (A \u2228 ~E) and D \u2022 ~B. The first part means that either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is necessary for the second part to hold true. The second part, D \u2022 ~B, indicates that Russell making dinner is sufficient for Izzy not playing Minecraft. Combining both parts, we can infer that either Marina reading a book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The biconditional implies that if either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh doesn't stop by, then it necessarily follows that both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The given argument discusses the relationship between the world, knowledge, living creatures, and man's ability to contemplate it. Throughout the passage, Schopenhauer emphasizes that while the concept of the world being an idea might apply to all living beings, only humans can ponder upon this notion. This leads to the attainment of philosophical wisdom when they do so. The most conclusive statement from these ideas is the assertion that the world itself is an idea. Therefore, we can identify the main conclusion from this argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's central claim is that the idea of the world being a mental construct is a universal truth applicable to all living beings, even though only humans can fully grasp its implications.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement negates the existence of people driving on Mars, which means we need to express that no person (P) is driving (D) on Mars. In predicate logic, the double negation can be simplified as a single negation.

Option B uses universal quantification (\u2200x) to state that for all x (person), if there is no driving (~Dx) then they are not on Mars (Px \u2228 ~Dx). This option correctly represents the given statement. Option C, '(∀x)(Px ⊖ ~Dx)', uses an exclusive disjunction (⊖), which is not necessary in this context.

Options C and D use a single instance (x or p), whereas we need to generalize it for all people (∀x). The closest option to our intended translation is B: (\u2200x)(Px ⊃ ~Dx) which means 'for all x, if x is a person then x does not drive'.

Option A uses double universal quantifiers which is incorrect as it implies every child goes to every school, while we want to say that every child goes to at least one school. Option B has an existential quantifier for schools and a universal quantifier for children, but the structure of the formula is not correct. It suggests that there exists a school such that all children go to it or they are connected by the 'Gxy' relation, which doesn't match our translation.

We can represent 'either George or Harry enrolls' using the disjunction symbol \u2283 (exclusive OR). Now, we need to connect this with Ira not enrolling. Since the condition for Ira not enrolling is independent of whether George or Harry enrolled, we use the conjunction symbol \u2228 (and) between these two events. The negation of 'enrolls' is denoted by a tilde (~).

This matches option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence suggests that either George enrolls, Harry enrolls, or Ira does not enroll, which can be represented by (G ⊃ H) ∨ I. However, the given options do not directly correspond to this expression. We need to find the closest symbolization. Option A is incorrect because it uses the logical NAND operation (⊕), which means both G and H cannot occur simultaneously. Option B uses the logical AND operation (∧) between the two conditions (G or H) and I, which would result in a contradiction with the sentence's meaning. Option C is closer because it uses the logical NOR operation (⊥) between G or H and negates I (~I). However, this symbolization means that if George or Harry enrolls, then Ira must not enroll. In contrast, the given sentence only implies that one of these two conditions should occur for Ira to not enroll. Option D is similar to option C but uses the logical OR operation (∨) instead of NOR.

The 'if' clause states the condition under which the restaurant serves corn and potatoes, so the antecedent is 'The restaurant has peas.' (negated as it does not have them).

Since there are multiple counterexamples where the left side is true but the right side is false (e.g., when M and O are true and N is false or when M is true and O and N are false), the argument is invalid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (N) must be false. Since the second premise includes '~M', let's make M true. This would make the first premise true regardless of the value of N. Now, we need to determine the values for O and N that result in a false conclusion. Let's try setting N as true since it should be false for an invalid argument. With M being true and N being true, the second premise becomes '(True) \u00b7 O / True', which is always true regardless of O's value. Therefore, let's set O to false in this counterexample. This satisfies our conditions: M (True), O (False), and N (True). Option C presents a similar scenario with M being true and both O and N being false, but it does not guarantee the conclusion (N) as false.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, construct the truth tables for both expressions:\n\n(G \u2283 H) \u2228 ~H:\n| G | H | (G \u2283 H) | ~H | Result |\n| T | T | F | T | T |\n| T | F | T | T | T |\n| F | T | F | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T | T\n\n~G \u2283 G:\n| G | Result |\n| T | F |\n| F | T |\nNow, compare the truth tables to determine if they're logically equivalent or contradictory. The two expressions have different results for the 'T', 'F' case in the first expression's table and the 'T' case in the second expression's table. Therefore, they are neither logically equivalent nor contradictory. To check consistency, we need to find a combination of truth values that leads to a false result in both expressions simultaneously. In this case, there is no such combination. Hence, these statements are consistent.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Applying De Morgan's Law to the first proposition, we get ~(G ⊃ H) • ~~H, which simplifies to (~G • ~H) • H. This looks similar to the second proposition (~G ⊃ G), suggesting they might be contradictory. However, constructing truth tables for both propositions will confirm this. After creating the truth tables and checking their results, we find that the two statements are indeed contradictory. Therefore, neither logically equivalent nor consistent.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement is a biconditional, which means 'if and only if'. We can represent it in predicate logic as P ⇐⇒ Q, where P stands for 'Cecilia breaks my heart', and Q represents 'Maria is either a problem or a girl'. In this case, 'or' can be represented using the disjunction symbol (∨) and 'if and only if' can be expressed as ⇐⇒. So, we need to find the correct representation of P and Q in predicate logic. The given options seem to have some errors in their notation. However, option A comes closest with Bc for P (Cecilia breaks my heart) and (Pm ∧ Gm) for Q (Maria is either a problem or a girl). In predicate logic, 'and' is represented using the symbol ∧. So, the correct translation should be something like Bc ⇐⇒ (Pm ∧ Gm), but with A being the closest match among the given options.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Cecilia breaking my heart and Maria being a problem and a girl. This translates to an 'if-then' statement with a conjunction. In predicate logic, this can be represented as Bc (Cecilia breaks my heart) iff (iff stands for if and only if) Pm \u2022 Gm (Maria is either a problem or a girl). Option B matches this interpretation: Bc \u2261 (Pm \u2022 Gm).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given formula uses logical operators from propositional logic. '~B \u2022 E' means the conjunction of two negations, which is equivalent to the disjunction (OR) of B and E. In plain English, this means 'when it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by'. The '∧' symbol represents AND operation, so when combined with D, it indicates that if the previous condition is true, then D (Russell makes dinner) holds. Therefore, option A correctly translates this formula into natural English.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The formula suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Izzy playing Minecraft and Ashleigh stopping by, leading to Russell making dinner. The '~B \u2022 E' part means 'it is not the case that both B and E are true'. This negation operation is combined with the logical AND ('\u2022') symbol. Then, this result is combined using a logical OR ('\u2283') with statement D (Russell makes dinner). Therefore, the correct interpretation would be: 'If it's not the case that both Izzy plays Minecraft and Ashleigh stops by then Russell makes dinner.'",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. In a conditional proposition, there is an antecedent (if-clause) and a consequent (then-clause). Here, the antecedent refers to the condition that must be met for the consequent to occur. The antecedent in this case would be the situation where both conditions - the governor approving it and the board of trustees recommending it - are fulfilled. Therefore, the correct answer is the combination of options B and C.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence mentions the governor approving of the tuition raise as a condition, suggesting this is the antecedent of the conditional proposition. Similarly, the board of trustees recommending it also serves as a condition. Therefore, the complete situation that needs to occur before the university raises tuition is when both conditions are met. Hence, the correct answer represents these two conditions combined.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement describes a conditional relationship between two events - Leroy being bad (B) and DJ Khaled shouting his name (S). In predicate logic, 'only if' translates to an implication or material implication symbolized as '→'. So, we can represent the statement as B → S. The provided options are in the form of P \u2283 Q or P \u2261 Q. The former represents the disjunction (or) and the latter represents the negation of equality. Since our statement is an implication, option D: ""Bl \u2283 Sk"" does not fit. Among the remaining options, only C: ""Bx \u2283 Sy"" follows the correct pattern for representing B → S (where Bx and Sy represent variables for Leroy being bad and DJ Khaled shouting his name).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that DJ Khaled shouting Leroy's name is a sufficient condition for Leroy being bad. This translates to (Sk ≡ Bl). Since the only sufficient condition is mentioned, we can represent it as (Bl \u2283 Sk) in predicate logic. Therefore, the correct translation is option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. We can create a truth table for the given argument to check its validity:\n\n| E | F | ~F | ~G | G | ~G | ~E |\n| T | T | F | F | T | T | F |\n| T | F | T | T | F | F | T |\n| F | T | T | F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | T | T | F | T | T \nFrom the truth table, we can see that the conclusion (~E) is true when the premises are true in all valid rows. This means that if any of the premises E \u2283 F and G \u2283 ~F / ~G are true, then the conclusion ~E will also be true. Therefore, this argument is valid.\nHowever, we need to provide a counterexample for one of the options given.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion must be false. Since the conclusion includes negations, let's make both ~G and ~E false, meaning G and E are true. This will result in the argument being invalid. However, we need to check if the given options match this scenario. Option B presents E, F, and G as true, which contradicts our counterexample. Option C provides E and G as true and F as false, which matches our scenario. Therefore, the argument is invalid with a counterexample when E and G are true and F is false.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We need to check if the truth value of the conclusion (~C) is preserved under all possible combinations of the premises' truth values. The first premise (A ⊃ ¬B) ∨ C holds true when either A implies not B or C is true. The second premise C ⊃ D and D ⊃ A are independent statements. However, they don't contribute to the validity of the overall argument. Therefore, we only need to consider the first premise with C. To find counterexamples, let's test different combinations. Option B's counterexample is invalid because if A is false, then the first premise doesn't hold true. Option C's counterexample can work as it satisfies the conditions when B and D are true, and A and C are false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (D ⊃ A) must be false. This means D must be true and A must be false. Since the second premise involves ~D, let's make C false as well. Now, we have B, D, and C as true values, while A and C are false. This satisfies the first premise (A ⊃ B) \u2283 C because when C is false, any value for A will satisfy the implication. Similarly, it also satisfies the second premise C \u2283 ~D / D \u2283 A since C is false and D is true. Therefore, this argument is invalid.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given argument consists of two conditional statements connected with a logical AND (∧). To construct the truth table, we consider all possible combinations of the premises C and D. After creating the truth table, we can determine if the argument is valid or invalid based on whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises in every row. In this case, option B provides a counterexample when both C and D are true, making the argument invalid.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find a counterexample, the conclusion (C) must be false. Since the second premise (D ⊃ C) has C as the consequent, let's make D true to potentially make the second premise true. Now, we need to ensure that the first premise (~C ∧ D) is false. If C is true, then the first premise becomes false and makes the argument invalid because both premises are not satisfied. Therefore, option B: 'Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true' provides a valid counterexample.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement describes a relationship between animals, cruel people, and persons (people in general). We need to represent this using predicate logic. Option A correctly captures the idea that some animals are not necessarily cruel or people, but they are neglected by someone who might be cruel and a person. This is expressed through the quantifier (\u2203x) for 'there exists' and the conjunction (\u2022) to connect the conditions. Option B swaps the cruelty and personhood of x, which doesn't align with the statement. Option C also swaps cruelty and animal/person relationships. Option D uses a double quantifier, which is not necessary for this simple statement. Therefore, option A best represents the translation into predicate logic.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies a relationship between animals and cruel people. This suggests an existential quantifier for both, so we start with (∃x)(∃y). The given variables represent animal (Ax), cruel person (Cx), and person (Px). We need to connect these with the neglected relation (Nxy). The sentence does not specify that cruel people are always persons or animals are always neglected by cruel people, so we use a conjunction for Ax ∨ Cx. Similarly, we add another conjunction for Py ∨ Nyx. Now, combining these conditions with the existential quantifiers, we get (∃x)[(Ax ∧ Cx) ∨ (∃y)(Py ∧ Nyx)]. However, the given options do not match this exact translation. Option A is closest to our translation but has a reversed order of Ax and Cx in the first conjunction. Therefore, we can conclude that option A comes closest to the intended translation.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The given sentence can be broken down into two parts: a disjunction (either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll), and a consequent (Jim enrolls). In propositional logic, the disjunction is represented using '∨' (or) while negation is represented as '~'. The consequent is represented by '→' (implies). We need to find the correct arrangement of these symbols for the given sentence. Option A has a wrong combination of symbols. In option B, the disjunction is incorrectly written as H \u2228 G and the consequent symbol is misplaced. Option C correctly represents the disjunction (H \u2228 ~G) and the consequent (⊢ J). Therefore, it matches the given sentence's meaning. Option D has a wrong disjunction written as (H \u2283 ~G), which is not equivalent to 'either Harry enrolls or George does not enroll'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that either Harry enrolls or George doesn't enroll, but not both, so we use the exclusive disjunction symbol. This part can be represented as H \u2228 ~G. Afterward, we need to connect this condition with 'then Jim enrolls', which means a conjunction (and). So, we combine it with J using the logical conjunction symbol \u2283. The correct representation is therefore (H \u2228 ~G) \u2283 J, which corresponds to option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are looking for a proposition that can be derived directly from the given premises using the rules of propositional logic (PL). The first premise can be simplified as N ∨ ~O and the second one as P ∨ (N ∨ ~O). From the third premise, we know that N is not equal to P. Now, let's substitute N ∨ ~O from the second premise into it: P ∨ (~P ∨ ~O). Since P and ~P cannot both be true at the same time, this simplifies further to P ∨ ~O. Finally, we can use this simplified version of the second premise with the fourth premise (N ∨ P) to derive N ∨ (P ∨ ~O). Since N is not equal to P, this becomes ~O. Now, let's compare this derived proposition with the given choices. The only match is C: O ⊕ Q.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The second premise states that P implies (N ⊃ ~O), and since the third premise affirms N ⊃ P, we can directly infer (N ⊃ ~O). Now, let's analyze the given proposition: (N ⊃ ~O) ⊃ (O ∧ Q). Using the second premise, we can substitute (N ⊃ ~O) with P. This results in P ⊃ (O ∧ Q). Since this is a one-step consequence based on the given premises, the correct answer is choice B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. First, we simplify the given propositions using truth tables:\n~N \u2261 (O \u00b7 P) becomes N \u2283 (O \u00b7 P)\n~O \u2283 Q becomes O \u2284 Q\nN \u00b7 ~Q remains the same.\nNow, we check for consistency:\nIf N \u2283 (O \u00b7 P) and N is true, then either O or P must be false to make the expression true.

Therefore, the set of propositions is consistent.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If N, O, and P are true, then ~N is false, (O · P) is true, and ~O is false, making the first two premises true. Since N and ~Q are true, the third premise is also true. This results in a consistent set of propositions. Among the given options, B provides a consistent valuation where N, O, and P are true and Q is false.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The given statement is 'No artifacts are people'. We can translate this into predicate logic by negating the relationship between artifacts (denoted as A) and people (denoted as P). This means we want to express that there is no instance where an artifact is a person. In propositional logic, the negation of 'Pa' would be '~Pa'. However, since we are translating into predicate logic, we need to use universal quantification to ensure that this holds true for all instances (denoted as x). The correct translation should include an implication or a material conditional to express the absence of a relationship. Option B provides us with this structure: '(\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 ~Px)', where the universal quantifier ensures that for all x, if it is an artifact (Ax), then it cannot be a person (~Px).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that for every x, if x is an artifact, then x is not a person, so we use the universal quantifier and the conjunction symbol. In predicate logic notation, this can be represented as '(\u2200x)(Ax \u2283 ~Px)'. Option A uses the double negation '~Pa', which might create ambiguity in interpretation. Option C is similar to our desired answer but uses the single negation '~Ap' instead of conjunction with 'not artifact'. Option D also uses a different symbol ('\u2022') instead of the correct conjunction symbol ('\u2283').",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. We want to translate the given English statement into predicate logic.

In predicate logic, 'if-then' statements are represented using the conditional operator '\u2261' or '\u2283'. The 'or' operation is denoted by '\u2022'. Now let's compare each option: Option A uses '\u2283', which is a stronger implication, not suitable for this scenario. Option B uses the correct conditional operator '\u2261' but has an incorrect variable 'x' instead of 'j'. Option C correctly uses '\u2261' and represents the conditions as Dn and Bj, but it also has a typo with 'Sl' instead of 'sl'. Finally, option D uses '\u2283', which is not suitable for this scenario. Therefore, the best translation among these options is given in Option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence implies that Delilah being in New York City is equivalent to both Juana being in Bogota and Layla being in San Juan, so we use the biconditional and conjunction symbols.
