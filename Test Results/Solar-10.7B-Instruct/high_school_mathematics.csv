D,"Let's reason step by step. Each vertex is the product of three adjacent numbers on the faces, so if we consider a single face, it will be multiplied by three other numbers at its adjacent vertices. Since the sum of the numbers on the vertices is $1001$, this means that each face has an average contribution of $1001/6$ to the sum of vertex products. However, when we calculate the sum of the numbers written on the faces themselves, there's no multiplication involved. Therefore, the sum of the numbers on the faces will be equal to the sum of the individual numbers without any multiplications.

For each integer, there are 49 remaining numbers to choose from without repeating the tens digit. Since we want all 5 integers to have different tens digits, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a unique tens digit for each number and multiply them together. The probability of choosing a unique tens digit for one integer is $\frac{4}{49}$. Multiplying this by itself 4 times (since there are 5 integers), we get $\left(\frac{4}{49}\right)^5$. Therefore, the probability that they each have a different tens digit is $\left(\frac{4}{49}\right)^5 = \frac{1000}{52969}$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There are 5 different tens digits from 2 to 6. Choosing any of these for each of the 5 integers gives a probability of 1/4 for each choice, so the total probability is (1/4)^5.

To correct for this, we divide by the number of ways to arrange the integers with repetitions among the tens digits. This can be calculated using multinomial coefficients: (5+4)!/(4!)(1!) = 90.

We can then combine like terms by adding the coefficients of $k$: $\frac{3k-2}{4} + 3k = \frac{6k-2}{4}$. Lastly, we add the constant term: $\frac{6k-2}{4} + 1 = \frac{6k-2+4}{4} = \frac{6k}{4} = \frac{3k}{2}$. Since this is equal to $3k$, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

For our function f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x on the interval [0, π], we need to find how many times it is differentiable. The derivative of this function is f'(x) = -2 cos x + 16 cos 4x. Since cosine functions have a period of π, both sin x and cos x are continuous and differentiable on the entire real number line. Similarly, cos 4x is also continuous and differentiable on the entire real number line. Therefore, f(x) = 2 sin x + sin 4x is differentiable on [0, π] exactly three times.

In this case, we have an octagon with 8 sides, so we can calculate the measure of each interior angle as follows: (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees. Since all angles in a regular polygon are congruent, each interior angle of this sign measures 1080/8 = 135 degrees.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A regular octagon has all sides and angles equal, just like a square. We know that the interior angles of a square are each 90 degrees, so the same must be true for a regular octagon. However, since an octagon has eight sides, we need to find the sum of its interior angles. The formula for finding the sum of interior angles in any polygon is (n-2) * 180°, where n represents the number of sides. For an octagon, n = 8. Plugging this into the formula, we get (8-2) * 180° = 6 * 180° = 1080°. Since there are eight angles in total, each interior angle would have a measure of 1080° / 8 = 135 degrees.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. When a function is increasing, it means that its graph rises as we move from left to right. In other words, y-values increase as x-values increase. Additionally, when the graph is concave up, it curves upward, meaning that the function is rising more quickly at each point on the graph. This implies that the average of any two points will be closer to the higher value than in a general case. When we use L, R, M, and T sums for approximating the area under the curve using subdivisions, the left (L) and right (R) sums are the minimum and maximum possible areas, respectively. The midpoint (M) sum is calculated by taking the average of each pair of consecutive y-values from L and R sums. Lastly, the trapezoid (T) sum approximates the area using the average of the function's values at each subdivision point. Since our function is both increasing and concave up, T will be closer to R than in a general case, making it greater than L and M. Therefore, the correct order for these sums would be:",B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest number that is divisible by both numbers, while the greatest common divisor (GCD) represents the largest number that divides both numbers without a remainder. We know that one integer is 48. Using the properties of LCM and GCD, we can set up the equation: LCM * GCD = Product of two integers. In this case, LCM = 240, GCD = 24, and one integer is 48. So, we have 240 * 24 = 48 * AnotherInteger. Simplifying the equation gives us 5760 = 48 * AnotherInteger. Dividing both sides by 48, we find that AnotherInteger = 120.

The area of the square is $3 \times 2 = 6$ square units, while the combined area of the two triangles is $\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 = 3$ square units. Therefore, the total area of the first quadrant is $6 - 3 = 3$ square units. The total area of the rectangle is $3 \times 2 = 6$ square units. So, the probability that $x < y$ is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The line y=x cuts the rectangle diagonally, creating two equal halves. So the probability of a randomly chosen point falling below the line (x < y) is 1/2.

The area below the line y=x in the rectangle is a right triangle with base 3 and height 1. Its area is (1/2)(3)(1) = 3/2. The total area of the rectangle is (3)(2) = 6.

However, due to the given condition that each exit is at least 6 km from the next one, we need to consider this minimum distance. The longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48 would be the maximum value allowed by this constraint. Since both exits are consecutive, their distance cannot exceed the maximum distance between any two adjacent exits (11.11 km) or the minimum distance of 6 km. In this case, the longest possible distance is 11.11 km - 1 decimal place would be 11 km.

Since each exit is at least 6 km from the next, the longest distance would be the difference between their numbers multiplied by the maximum distance per exit (11.11 km). The difference in number between exits 47 and 48 is 1, so the longest possible distance would be 1 * 11.11 = 11.11 km. However, we are given distances in kilometers, so this value is already correct.

To find the smallest possible value of x, we want to minimize it while still satisfying the equation. If we choose x = 9, then the LCM/GCD would be (45 * 9) / GCD(45, 9) = 33.

Since the result of dividing the LCM by the GCD is 33, and one integer is 45, the GCD must be a factor of 45.

To find the number of such integers, we can consider each set of 13 consecutive integers and count how many of them end in 5 or 10 (since 10 is also congruent to 5 modulo 13). Each set has either 1 or 2 numbers satisfying this condition. Since there are 16 sets of 13 integers within the range, we can expect an average of 16 * (1/2) = 8 numbers that satisfy the congruence.

A,"Let's reason step by step. We need to choose 3 cards from a deck of 52, but they must be from different suits. First, we select one card from each suit. There are 4 suits in a standard deck, so for each suit, we have 13 choices (since there are 13 ranks for each suit). After choosing one card from each suit, the remaining cards in the other suits don't matter because they will be different suits anyway. So, the total number of ways to choose these 3 cards is $4 \times 13$. Calculating this gives us a result of $52$. However, since the order of the cards does not matter, we need to divide by the permutation factorial for choosing 3 items (which is 3! or 6). Therefore, the final answer is $52/6 = 8\frac{1}{3}$.

For all other deliveries to be incorrect, there are 2! ways to arrange them among the wrong houses. So, the total number of arrangements with exactly two correct deliveries is 6 * 2 * 2! = 48.

Therefore, the side length of the square is also 2 (twice the radius). To find the area of the square, we square the side length: $2^2 = 4$. However, this question provides options in terms of units, so we need to scale it by the coefficient of the original equation.

To find the slope of a line passing through two points, we can use the formula m = (y₂ - y₁) / (x₂ - x₁), where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are the coordinates of the given points. In this case, our points are (5, 4) and (-2, 3). Plugging these values into the formula, we get m = (3 - 4) / (-2 - 5) = -1 / -7 = 1/7. So, the slope of the line is 1/7 or approximately 0.143, which is closest to option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slope of the line is given by the change in y divided by the change in x, which is $\frac{4-3}{5-(-2)} = \frac{1}{7}$. To simplify this fraction, we can find a common divisor for both numerator and denominator: 1 and 7 have 1 as their greatest common divisor. So, the slope becomes $\frac{1}{7} = \frac{1}{42} \cdot \frac{7}{1}$. Simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{6}$. However, none of the given options match this value. The closest option is C: 0.33, which can be obtained by dividing 1 by 3. While not exact, it's the most reasonable choice among the provided answers.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. We are given the initial number of fungi (P) as 100, the final number after 5 hours (A) as 750, and the time elapsed in hours (t) as 5. We can rewrite the exponential equation as A = P * e^(rt). Substituting the given values, we have 750 = 100 * e^(0.8r). To find r, let's isolate it by dividing both sides of the equation by 100: 7.5 = e^(0.8r). Now, take the natural logarithm of both sides to get rid of the exponential function: ln(7.5) = 0.8 * r. Solve for r by dividing both sides by 0.8: r = (ln(7.5)) / 0.8. Calculating this, we find that r is approximately 2.015.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Plugging in the given values into the equation, we get $750 = 100e^{5r}$, which simplifies to $7.5 = e^{5r}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we have $\log(7.5) = 5r$. Since $5$ is a constant, we can divide both sides by $5$, resulting in $\frac{\log(7.5)}{5} = r$. Using a calculator, we find that $\frac{\log(7.5)}{5} \approx 0.863$. However, the closest value among the given choices is $\boxed{B}$.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the domain of $f(x)$, we need to identify the values of $x$ that make the denominator $1-x$ nonzero. This means $1-x \neq 0$, or $-1 < x < 1$. However, when finding the range, we consider the output values of the function. Since the function is inverted by multiplying both sides with $1-x$, the range will be the same as the domain. Therefore, the correct answer is the interval notation for $(-1,1)$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}$ is undefined when $x = 1$, so the range of the function cannot include 1. Similarly, the function cannot output 0 since the numerator is always 1. To find the interval where the denominator (1 - x) does not equal zero, we have $|x| < 1$. This means that the domain for $f(x)$ is (-1, 1). However, we are looking for the range of this function. The function is a reciprocal of a linear function, which means it stretches vertically and reflects over the x-axis. Since the vertical stretch makes the output values unbounded on both sides, the correct answer should include intervals that cover all real numbers except 1 and 0. Comparing this with the given options, we find that interval notation (A) (-∞, -1) ∪ (1, ∞) satisfies these conditions.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. If multiplying 10 by $\\frac{1}{3}$ five times gives the same result as using a single fraction, we can write this as $10 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^5 = x$. To find the value of $x$, we simplify the expression: $10 \cdot \frac{1}{3^5} = x$. Now, let's calculate $3^5$ to solve for $x$: $3^5 = 243$. Substituting this back into our equation, we have $10 \cdot \frac{1}{243} = x$. So, the single fraction that John can use is $\boxed{\\frac{1}{243}}$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3}$ five times is the same as multiplying 10 by $\frac{1}{3^5}$, since when you multiply powers with the same base you add the exponents. To find a single fraction that gives the same result, we need to find $3^5$ and then divide 10 by it. Calculating $3^5$, we get $243$. So, the single fraction would be $\frac{1}{243}$.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the number of positive and negative multiples of 12, we can list them out: -12, -6, 0, 6, 12. There are a total of 5 multiples (including zero), but since we're looking for the number of positive and negative integers separately, we need to divide by 2 because each multiple has a corresponding negative multiple. So, there are $\frac{5}{2}$ sets of positive and negative multiples. However, this question asks for the total count of these sets, which is still just 1 (since there's only one set). Therefore, the answer is 1, but in terms of the given choices, the closest option is 4.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The positive divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. Out of these, the negative integers that are multiples of 12 would be -12 and -24 (since we can't have negative divisors for a multiple). However, since -24 is not given as an option, we only consider -12 and 12. So, there are two negative integers and one positive integer that are multiples of 12. In total, this makes 2 + 1 = 3 numbers. Therefore, the answer matches choice A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite the given equation as $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$. By Vieta's formulas for the sum of the products, we know that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = (a+b+c)$. Substituting this into our equation, we have $(a+b+c)(a+b+c) = 150$. Factoring out $(a+b+c)$, we get $a+b+c = \pm\sqrt{150}$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, the value of $a+b+c$ should be a positive integer. The only option that satisfies this condition is 12. Therefore, $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 150$ implies $a+b+c=12$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can expand the left side of the equation as $(a+b+c)^3 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 - a^3 - b^3 - c^3 = 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3ac^2 + 3b^2c + 3bc^2$. Since this equals 150, we can set up the system of equations: $3a^2b = 50$, $3ab^2 = 50$, $3a^2c = 50$, $3ac^2 = 50$, and $3b^2c = 50$. Dividing each equation by 3, we get: $a^2b = 16.7$, $ab^2 = 16.7$, $a^2c = 16.7$, $ac^2 = 16.7$, and $b^2c = 16.7$. Since these are all positive integers, the only possible whole number solution is when $a=b=c=3$. Therefore, $a+b+c = 3+3+3 = 9$.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The number of digits in a geometric sequence term depends on the base-10 logarithm of that term, i.e., $\log_{10}(a \cdot r^{n-1})$. As $r$ is greater than 1, the exponent $n-1$ will increase with each term. To have terms with the same number of digits, we need to find a range of values for $n$ where the logarithm remains approximately constant. The larger the difference between $a$ and $r$, the smaller the range of $n$ that satisfies this condition. Since we want the smallest possible range to maximize the value of $k$, we can assume $a$ and $r$ have similar digit counts. Therefore, a small enough $k$ might be achievable but not necessarily 16 (D). The largest possible value among the given options is C, which is 8.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since $r$ is greater than 1, each term in the geometric series will have one more digit than the previous term. To find the largest possible value of $k$, we want to maximize the number of distinct numbers with the same number of digits. If Bill picks four numbers (option A), for example, their digits could be 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, if he chooses five numbers (option B) or more, some numbers will have a different number of digits from others due to the geometric progression. Therefore, option C with a value of 8 is not achievable since it would require numbers with the same number of digits that do not exist in this sequence. Thus, the largest possible value for $k$ is 4.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, simplify the left side of the equation: $(-1/3)(-4 - 3x) = (-1/3)(-4) + (-1/3)(-3x)$. This becomes $4/3 - 3x/3$. Since the denominators are the same, we can combine them to get $4/3 - x$. Now our equation is $4/3 - x = 1/2$. To isolate $x$, we subtract $4/3$ from both sides: $-x = 1/2 - 4/3$. Further simplify the right side: $1/2 - 4/3 = -1/6$. Now our equation is $-x = -1/6$. To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides by $-1$ to change the sign: $x = 1/6$. Let's find the closest match among the given options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we distribute the $\frac{1}{3}$ to get $4 + 3x = \frac{1}{2}$. Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by -6 to eliminate the fraction: $-24 - 18x = -3$. Now, let's isolate the variable term by adding 18x to both sides: $-24 = -18x - 3$. Adding 3 to both sides gives us $-21 = -18x$. Finally, divide both sides by -18 to solve for x: $x = \frac{21}{18}$. Simplify the fraction: $x = \frac{7}{6} \div \frac{2}{3} = \frac{7 \cdot 3}{6 \cdot 3} = \frac{7}{6}$.",B

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2$, where 's' represents the length of a side. Plugging in 's' as 12, we get $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 12^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 144$. This is approximately 85.94 square inches.

D,"Let's reason step by step. John divided his pins into two equal piles. After giving one-half of one-third of one pile to his brother, we can represent the number of pins in that pile as x/2. The number of pins given to his brother is (1/3) * (x/2) = (x/6). Since John had 66 pins left, the remaining number of pins is x - (x/6). We can set up an equation: x - (x/6) = 66. To solve for x, we first get rid of the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6: 6x - x = 396. Simplifying, we have 5x = 396. Dividing both sides by 5, we find that x = 79.2 (rounded to two decimal places). Since John cannot have a fraction of pins, we can assume he initially had 79 pins. Therefore, the original number of pins is 79 * 2 = 158.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If John gave away one-third of one pile, that means he gave away $\frac{1}{3} \times 33 = 11$ pins. Since the two piles had an equal number of pins and John initially had 66 pins left, we can set up the equation: Initial pins - Given pins = Pins left. So, Initial pins = Pins left + Given pins.

C,"Let's reason step by step. For the first stone, Alex walks 3 feet out and back, totaling 6 feet. For each subsequent stone, the distance increases by 2 feet. So for the second stone it's 5 feet (3+2), third stone is 7 feet (5+2), and so on. To find the total distance walked after placing all 50 stones, we can use a pattern: 6 + 5(1 to 49). Calculating this gives us 6 + 245 = 251. However, since Alex returns to the crate after each stone, we need to exclude the initial 6 feet from the total. Therefore, the total distance walked is 251 - 6 = 245 feet. The closest answer in our options is C: 5200.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Alex walks 3 feet to place the first stone and 3 feet back, so the total distance is 6 feet. For each subsequent stone, Alex walks an additional 2 feet farther (3 + 2 = 5 feet) to place it and returns the same distance. The pattern repeats until Alex places the 50th stone. To find the total distance walked, we can sum up the distances for all 50 stones. From the first to the last stone, the distances are: 6, 11, 16, ..., 49. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 5 feet. We can find the sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. Plugging in our values, we have S = (50/2)(6 + 49) = (50/2)(55) = 11(55) = 595 feet. Therefore, Alex walked a total of 595 feet.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. First, find the cost of Bright. Since it's $60\%$ more expensive than Fresh, Bright costs $1.00 + (60/100)(1.00) = 1.00 + 0.60 = 1.60$ per unit of volume. Next, find the cost of Glow. Since it's $25\%$ less expensive than Bright, Glow costs $1.60 - (25/100)(1.60) = 1.60 - 0.40 = 1.20$ per unit of volume. Finally, convert the cost to cents by multiplying by 100: Glow's price is $1.20 \times 100 = 120$ cents per unit of volume.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If Glow has more volume than Fresh and is more expensive than Bright, then its price per unit volume must be significantly higher than Fresh's $1.00. Since Fresh costs $1.00 and has 100% volume, we can calculate the price per unit volume for each tube based on their volume percentages: Glow = (1 + 33.33%) * 1.00 = $1.335, Bright = (1 - 25%) * 1.335 = $1.4675, Fresh remains at $1.00.

A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the critical points of f(x), we set f(x) = 0 and solve for x. We have a cubic equation, which can have at most three real solutions. For statement B, since f(x) is a polynomial function, it may take on values less than -18. Statement C is incorrect because the inequality sign is reversed. Lastly, to determine if the function is decreasing for x < -3, we need to find the second derivative and analyze its sign, which isn't provided in this question. Therefore, statement A is the only true one.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The derivative of the function is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 4x - 9$. This is a parabola that opens upwards, so the function is decreasing for $x \leq -3$. However, this doesn't support statement D as it refers to $x < -3$. To check if f(x) = 0 has three real solutions, we can find the discriminant of the cubic equation. Since calculating the discriminant is out of scope in this context, we cannot determine whether there are three real solutions or not. Statement A and B are related to the number of solutions and function behavior respectively, but neither can be confirmed with the given information. The statement C indicates that f(x) < -18 for all x < 0. To check this, let's consider the function value for x < 0: $f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18$. Since the leading coefficient of the cubic term is positive (3), and the quadratic term has a positive leading coefficient (2) and a negative constant term (-9), the function value will be negative for all x < 0.

Substituting these into the expression $x^2 + xy + y^2 + n$, we get $(7a + 3)^2 + (7a)(7b + 3) + (7b - 3)^2 + n$. To make this a multiple of 7, all its terms should also be multiples of 7. Simplifying and analyzing the coefficients, we find that $n$ must be a multiple of 7 as well. The smallest positive integer, $n$, that satisfies this condition is $n = \boxed{2}$.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since $x-3$ and $y+3$ are multiples of 7, their sum, $x+y$, must also be a multiple of 7. Therefore, $x^2 + xy + y^2$ must also be a multiple of 7, and we don't need to add anything further. Now, let's find the smallest positive integer, $n$, that makes $x^2 + xy + y^2 + n$ divisible by 7. Since $x+y$ is a multiple of 7, adding any multiple of 7 to it will still result in a multiple of 7. So, we can choose $n=0$. However, the question asks for the smallest positive integer $n$, and since our goal is to make the expression divisible by 7, choosing $n=2$ would be the smallest positive integer that satisfies this condition. Therefore, $n=2$ makes $x^2 + xy + y^2 + n$ a multiple of 7.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The list consists of consecutive integers starting from -36 and ending at 48 with an increment of 7 (the difference between consecutive numbers). To find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we can use the formula for the number of terms: $\frac{n_2-n_1}{d} + 1$, where $n_1$ is the first term, $n_2$ is the last term, and $d$ is the common difference. Plugging in our values, we have $\frac{48-(-36)}{7} + 1 = \frac{84}{7} + 1 = 12$. Therefore, there are 12 numbers in this list.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The common difference between the terms is 7. To get from -36 to 48, we need to add 7 eleven times. So, there are 11 numbers in the list. However, since we have included both endpoints (-36 and 48), we should subtract 2 to exclude them as they were counted implicitly. Therefore, there are $11-2=9$ numbers excluding the endpoints. But this question asks for the total number of numbers in the list, so we include the endpoints again. In conclusion, there are a total of $9+2=11$ numbers in the list.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. When we multiply a function by a constant, the domain remains unchanged. In this case, we are multiplying sin x by 3 and replacing it with sin 2x. The multiplication does not affect the domain. However, when we change sin x to sin 2x, the range of the function is affected. Since the range of sin x is [-1, 1], the range of sin 2x will be half of that, i.e., [-0.5, 0.5]. This means the range is divided by 2 (or multiplied by 0.5). As a result, the domain remains unchanged but the range is halved or doubled in size (inversely), making option C incorrect for the range. Therefore, we can conclude that the domain is unaffected and the range is altered.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. Multiplying it by 3 will simply stretch the oscillation vertically, but the domain and range will remain the same. Now, replacing sin x with 2x doubles the period of the function, meaning the domain is extended to cover twice as many angles. However, since we are also multiplying by 3, this effect is canceled out, maintaining the original domain. On the other hand, the range will be stretched vertically by a factor of 3, resulting in a doubled range. Therefore, the domain remains unchanged while the range is doubled.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In a rectangle, the diagonal is related to its length and width using the Pythagorean theorem. Let the width be W. Since the length is twice the width, we have Length = 2W. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write (Length)^2 + (Width)^2 = Diagonal^2. So, (2W)^2 + W^2 = (5\sqrt{5})^2. Simplifying this equation gives us 4W^2 + W^2 = 25(5^2). Combining like terms, we have 5W^2 = 125. Dividing both sides by 5, we get W^2 = 25. The width is the square root of this value, so W = 5. Now that we know the width, we can find the length as Length = 2W = 2 * 5 = 10. To calculate the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length and width: Area = Length * Width = 10 * 5 = 50 square units. We need to find the answer among the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have $(2w)^2 + w^2 = (5\sqrt{5})^2$.

After a full day of 24 hours, the bacteria will double 24/3.33 = 7.2 times (approximately). To find the approximate number after 1 full day, we can calculate 200 * 7.2. This gives us an approximate value of 1440. Therefore, the closest answer from the given options is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the population triples every 10 hours, then after 20 hours (2 periods of 10 hours), it would be $200 \times 3 = 600$. And after another 4 hours, it would be $600 + (\frac{4}{10} \times 600) = 840$. So in a full day (24 hours), the population would approximately be $600 + 840 = 1440$ bacteria. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. An arithmetic sequence consists of consecutive terms that differ by a constant. For odd integers, the common difference is 2. To find the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. For odd integers, the first term (a1) will be 1 and the common difference (d) will be 2. To find the number of terms (n) for each sequence such that their sum equals 240, we can use S = n/2 * (a1 + an). We'll solve this equation to find n. Since there are multiple solutions, we'll have multiple arithmetic sequences. Calculating and finding the values of n, we get 6, 8, 15, and 30 as possible number of terms for these sequences. Thus, there are a total of 4 sets of arithmetic sequences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sum of the arithmetic sequence is 240, which is a multiple of 5, the number of terms must also be a multiple of 5. The common difference between consecutive odd integers is always 2.

Therefore, there are 12 arithmetic sequences that satisfy the condition.",B

To find the inverse of $h(x)$, we switch $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$: $x = 6y - 5$. In order to isolate $y$, we add 5 to both sides and then divide by 6: $\frac{x+5}{6} = y$. Now, we compare this expression with the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the inverse of $h(x)$, we switch $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$.

First, we simplify the equation: $x^2 - 4x + 7 = b$. To find the value of $b$, we need to ensure that this quadratic equation in terms of $x$ has only one solution. This means its discriminant should be equal to zero. The discriminant is given by $D = b - 4(1)(7) = b - 28$. Since the discriminant is zero, we have $b - 28 = 0$, which implies $b = 28$. Now, let's check if this value of $b$ makes sense in our given options. We need to find the closest match among the provided choices. The closest option to 28 is 12.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For the parabola and line to intersect at only one point, their y-intercepts must be equal. Therefore, b must be 7. To find this value of b, we set the equation of the line equal to the equation of the parabola: $6x + b = x^2 + 2x + 7$. This will result in a quadratic equation for x. If it has only one solution, then there is only one point of intersection. Expanding and rearranging terms, we get $x^2 - 4x - b = 0$. For this quadratic to have only one real root, its discriminant must be zero: $(-4)^2 - 4(-b) = 0$. Simplifying, we have 16 + 16b = 0. Solving for b, we find that b = -1.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The quadratic inequality can be factored as $(x-1)(x-c) < 0$. For the inequality to have real solutions, the product of the factors should be greater than zero but not equal to zero and neither factor can be equal to zero.

Now, let's check the given answer choices: ",C,"Let's reason step by step. For the inequality to have real solutions, the discriminant must be equal to 6.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite $125$ as $5^4$. So, the equation becomes $\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)^{x+2} = (5^4)^{-x}$. Using the property of exponents, we have $\left(\frac{1}{25}\right)^{x+2} = \frac{1}{(5^4)^x}$. Simplifying further, we get $\frac{1}{25}^{x+2} = \frac{1}{5^{4x}}$. Now, we can equate the exponents on both sides: $x+2 = -4x$. Solving for $x$, we find $x = \frac{6}{5}$.

B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the reciprocal of $1815 \div 11$, we first solve the division: $1815 \div 11 = 165$. Then, we take the reciprocal of 165, which is $\frac{1}{165}$. Now, we can rewrite the given problem as dividing 11 by $\frac{1}{165}$. To perform this division, we multiply both numerator and denominator by 165: $11 \cdot 165 = 1815$. So, when we divide 11 by the reciprocal of $1815 \div 11$, we get 1815. However, our answer choices do not match this result.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

Solving for $x$, we find $x = (10.29)%.$ Now, let's find the time it takes $\$300$ to grow to $\$9600$ at the same interest rate: $A = 9600$, $P = 300$, and $r = 10.29%$. Solving for $t$, we get $t \approx 14.75$ years. The closest answer from the given choices is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since it takes 6 years to double $5000, it should take 1 year to reach $9600 from $300 because $9600 is roughly double $5000.

Therefore, if it takes 6 years to double $5000 at an $x\%$ interest rate, it should take $\frac{1}{6}$ of that time to double $300$.

A,"Let's reason step by step. In the expansion of $(m+n)^6$, each term can be expressed as a combination of $m$ and $n$.

There are two ways to have an odd number of $n$ in the terms: either have 1 more $n$ than $m$, or have 3 more $n$ than $m$. In both cases, we can use the binomial coefficient formula to find the number of such terms: $\binom{6}{1} + \binom{6}{3} = 6 + 20 = 26$. However, since we are looking for odd terms and not total terms, we need to divide by 2 because each term with an even number of $n$ will be even.

The center of this circle is the average of the given points: ((3+5)/2, (4+7)/2) = (4, 5.5). Point (5, 5) lies on the line connecting the two given points, so it will also lie on the circle.

Since the difference in angles between the two instances is 110 degrees, it takes the minute hand approximately 110/6 = 18.33 minutes to move from one position to another.

The point (2, 7) is 2 units away from the x-axis, so the shortest distance is 1.5 times the absolute value of its x-coordinate. However, this question asks for the distance to the y-axis, which means we need to find the distance when the point's y-coordinate is on the x-axis (0, y). The difference between the y-coordinates is 7 - 0 = 7 units. Therefore, the shortest distance between the y-axis and the given point is 7 units.",D

B,"Let's reason step by step. John divided his pins into two equal piles. After giving one-half of one-third of one pile to his brother, we can calculate the number of pins he gave away. One-third of one pile is (1/3) * x, where x represents the total number of pins in one pile. John then gives half of this amount, which is (1/2) * (1/3) * x. Since John had 66 pins left, we can set up an equation: (x - (1/2) * (1/3) * x) = 66. Simplifying the equation, we get (2/3) * x = 66. Solving for x, we find that x = (66 * 3)/2 = 108. Therefore, John originally had a total of 108 pins in both piles. Since he divided them into two equal piles, the original number of pins was 108 / 2 = 54 per pile.",A,"Let's reason step by step. John gave his brother 1/6 of a pile, which is 1/12 of the total number of pins. So, he gave away 66 / 12 = 5.5 pins.

Since we're looking for the single most correct answer, let's analyze the options. The largest number among them is 396, which seems too high compared to the remaining pins. Option C (66) is the count John has left and option D (36) would be too low if divided equally into two piles. Therefore, option B (72) appears to be the closest approximation of the original number of pins.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The given function $f(x)$ is a constant function, meaning its output value does not depend on the input $x$. In other words, no matter what the value of $x$ is, the result of $f(x)$ will always be 2. Now, we want to find the value of $f(x + 2)$. Since $x$ is replaced with $x + 2$, the function will still output 2 because it's a constant function. Therefore, the value of $f(x + 2)$ remains the same as $f(x)$, which is 2.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the function f(x) is defined as 2 for all real numbers, adding 2 to the input would also increase the output by 2. So, f(x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.

D,"Let's reason step by step. In calculus, the notations f(x), f'(x), and f''(x) represent the function itself, its derivative, and second derivative respectively. Statement A refers to the relationship between continuity at a point (f(x) continuous at x = c) and the existence of the derivative (f'(c)). This statement is true because if a function is continuous at a point, then its derivative exists at that point. Statement B talks about when f'(c) equals 0; this indicates that there might be a local maximum or minimum at (c, f(c)). Statement C discusses the second derivative (f''(x)) and how it being equal to zero at c implies an inflection point at (c, f(c)). Finally, statement D talks about differentiability and continuity. Differentiable functions are continuous, but the converse is not necessarily true; there can be discontinuous functions that are still differentiable. Therefore, Statement A is the correct one.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the second derivative indicates the concavity of a function, if f''(c) = 0, it means the function changes concavity at point c, which is the definition of an inflection point. Therefore, statement C is true. The first statement refers to the relationship between continuity and differentiability, which is correct as continuous functions are also differentiable (at least in their domain). However, differentiability does not guarantee continuity, making statement D incorrect.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. We can use the identity $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n-1}{r-1} + \binom{n-1}{r}$ to simplify the equation. Applying this to the left side, we get $\binom{24}{k} = \binom{23}{4} + \binom{23}{5}$. Setting it equal to the right side, we have $\binom{24}{k} = \binom{24}{k}$. Since these are both combinations of distinct numbers, 'k' must be a value that satisfies this equality. The only option that makes sense is when $k=5$, as it matches one of the terms on the left side.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The sum of the upper indices in the binomial coefficients on the left side is 23 + 4 + 23 + 5 = 55. Therefore, the value of k must be 55 - 24 = 31. Since we want to find the sum of integers k that satisfy this equation, it means there's only one such k. Now, we need to determine which answer choice represents k=31. ",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the $90^{\circ}$ angle. Since one of the angles is $45^{\circ}$, it forms a $45-45-90$ triangle. In this type of triangle, the length of each leg is equal to half the length of the hypotenuse. So, each leg has a length of $10/2 = 5$ inches. The area of a right triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base * height) / 2. In this case, base and height are the lengths of the legs. Therefore, the area is (5 * 5) / 2 = 12.5 square inches. However, none of the given options match exactly with this value. The closest approximation to this area can be found in option C: 125 square inches.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since one angle is 45 degrees and it's a right triangle, it's an isosceles right triangle. So, the base and height are both 10 inches. Therefore, the area is (1/2) * 10 * 10 = 50 square inches. However, none of the given options matches this value. Since we need to choose from the provided choices, let's consider another approach. In a right triangle, the length of each leg can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: c² = a² + b². Here, c is the hypotenuse (10 inches) and one angle is 45 degrees, which corresponds to an acute angle in the triangle. Using trigonometry, we can find the length of one leg using cosine function: a = 10 * cos(45). Calculating this value gives us approximately 7.07 inches for one leg. Now, let's calculate the area of the triangle using the legs' lengths: (1/2) * a * b = (1/2) * 7.07 * 7.07 = 34.36 square inches. The closest option to this value is C: 125 square inches, but it's still not exact. Unfortunately, none of the given options match any of our calculations. However, we should choose the most reasonable answer from the provided choices.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. First, we find the value of $f(x)$ when $x=5$: $f(5) = 3(5)^2 - 2 = 75-2 = 73$. Then, substitute this value into $g(f(x))$ to find $g(73)$. Finally, solve for the sum of all possible values of $g(73)$ by checking each answer choice. Since we don't have enough information about function $g$, we can only compare the given choices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We know f(x) = 3x^2 - 2, so f(25) = 3 * 25^2 - 2 = 1873. Therefore, g(f(25)) = g(1873) must also be 1873. Now we substitute this value into the function g(x): g(1873) = x^2 + x + 1. Since we are finding the sum of all possible values of g(25), there is only one case to consider, which is when f(25) equals 1873. Plugging this value into g(x): g(1873) = 1873^2 + 1873 + 1 = 3469004 + 1873 + 1 = 3469005. Now, we check which of the given options is equal to this sum: 3469005. The only option that matches is B (25).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean of the first 7 numbers is calculated as their sum divided by 7, which means the sum of these 7 numbers is 15 * 7 = 105. When an 8th number is added, the new mean becomes 12. This implies that the sum of all 8 numbers is 12 * 8 = 96. The difference between the sums of the first 7 numbers and all 8 numbers represents the value of the 8th number. So, we have: 8th number = Sum(all 8 numbers) - Sum(first 7 numbers). Plugging in the values, we get: 8th number = 96 - 105 = \u20139. However, according to the given choices, there is no option for a negative number.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean decreased by 3 when the 8th number was added. This means the 8th number must be 3 less than the original mean, so it's 15 - 3 = 12.

Let's check each option: A is -12, B is -9, C is 0, and D is 8. The closest value to -12 among these options is -12 itself (option A).",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. We need to find palindromes using the given letters. First, we focus on M since it is required. There are 3 Ms in MISSISSIPPI. Now, we can choose the remaining letters for each palindrome. The number of ways to arrange these remaining letters for a palindrome will be the same as arranging them normally. Calculating the total number of arrangements with 3 M's and varying numbers of other letters, we get (6C0 * 1) + (6C2 * 3) + (6C4 * 3) = 1 + (15 * 3) + (15 * 3) = 1 + 45 + 45 = 91. However, we need to subtract the original word MISSISSIPPI since it's already a palindrome. So, the final count of unique palindromes is 91 - 1 = 90. Among the given options, the closest answer is C: 86.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There are 11 letters in 'MISSISSIPPI'. So, the number of arrangements with 2 or more letters is 11!/(11-2)! = 110. Since 'M' is included in every arrangement, the answer is 110. Now, let's find the palindromes among these arrangements. For a string to be a palindrome, its first and last letters should match, second and penultimate letters should match, and so on. The middle letter can be any of the remaining letters in 'MISSISSIPPI'. There are 10 choices for this middle letter (excluding M). Now, we need to find the number of arrangements for the first half and last half of the palindrome. For each half, there are 4 choices (M, I, S, or P) since we have already chosen a middle letter. Therefore, the total number of palindromes is 10 * (4 * 4) = 80. Among these arrangements, some may contain repeated letters. However, our question asks for 'palindromes', not unique palindromes. So, we have counted each arrangement once. Hence, there are 80 distinct palindrome arrangements with the letter M formed from rearranging any subset of the letters in MISSISSIPPI.",C

Now, we want to express this result in the form $a\sqrt[3]{b}$. Since $a$ is an integer and $b$ is a positive integer, we can set $a = -4$ and $b = 1$.

Since we're looking for a positive value of $x$, we choose $x=3$.",C

We can use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series to find its value: $S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}$. In this case, $S_\infty = \frac{\frac{1}{2^1}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{0.5} = 2$. Therefore, the correct answer is the sum equaling 2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can see that $\frac{k}{2^k}$ approaches 0 as $k$ gets larger, so the sum of the series is 1. This is known as a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$. By using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series (when the common ratio is less than 1), we have: S = $\frac{a}{1 - r}$, where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio.

Now, we want to find the probability that Joe will eat at least two different kinds of fruit. This can be calculated as $1 - P(\text{eating only one type of fruit})$. The probability of eating only one type of fruit for all three meals is $\frac{3}{3^3} = \frac{1}{9}$.

A hexagon has 6 sides, and each side can be connected to 4 other sides to form a diagonal. However, we need to avoid counting diagonals that intersect at the same vertex as they are considered the same diagonal.

If the sum has a degree of 36, then each individual term should also have a degree that contributes to this total. Since $f(x)$ has degree 6 and $g(x)$ has degree 3, we can assume $h(x) = f(x)^2$ or $h(x) = g(x)^2$. In both cases, the degree of $h$ is 12 times 2 (the highest power of $x$) which equals 24.

When we combine these two terms, their highest degree terms will add up. Therefore, the degree of $h(x)$ should be such that when multiplied by $f(x)$, it results in a polynomial with a degree close enough to 36 so that when adding $f(g(x))$ (degree 18), we get a sum with degree 36.

In this case, we want to find the value at position (43, 2), which is C(43, 2). Calculating C(43, 2) gives us 16.

To cover the patio with a thickness of one brick, we need to divide the total patio area by the area of one brick: 17,280 / 24 = 720 bricks (approximately).

The graph of y > 9x - 8 is above the line and the graph of y < -x + 8 is below the line. For a point to be a solution to both inequalities, it must lie on or between these two lines. Let's check each point: (\u2013 2, 15) does not satisfy either inequality as its y-coordinate is too high; (\u20131, 5) satisfies the first inequality but not the second one since it lies above both lines; (0, 0) lies between the two lines and thus satisfies both inequalities; (1, 5) does not satisfy either inequality as its y-coordinate is too high.

Plugging in the coordinates of point (1, 5) into both inequalities shows that it satisfies both. Similarly, plugging in (\u2013 2, 15) also results in satisfying both inequalities. For (0, 0), when we substitute into the first inequality, y > 9(0) - 8 which is true because y = 0 and 0 > (-8). However, for the second inequality, y < 0(-1) + 8 which is not true as y = 0 and 0 < 8. Therefore, (0, 0) does not satisfy both inequalities. Lastly, plugging (\u20131, 5) into the first inequality gives us y > 9(-\u20131) - 8 which is false because y = 5 and 5 < (-7).

The advertised width of 48 inches refers to the diagonal measurement. To find the diagonal length, we use the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal² = length² + height² = (5x)² + (3x)². Solving for x, we get x = 12. Therefore, the horizontal length is 5x = 60 inches and the advertised width of 48 inches represents the diagonal measurement. To find how much shorter the horizontal length will be if measured along the diagonal, subtract the diagonal from the horizontal length: 60 - 48 = 12 inches. The nearest inch to 12 is 12 itself.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we know that $a^2 + b = c^2$. Since the ratio of the length to the height is 5 to 3, we can say that $a = 5x$ and $b = 3x$ for some value of $x$. The advertised width is given as 48 inches, which represents the diagonal length ($c$). So, we have $5^2x^2 + 3^2x^2 = 48^2$. Simplifying this equation gives us $25x^2 + 9x^2 = 2304$. Combining like terms, we get $34x^2 = 2304$. Dividing both sides by 34, we find that $x^2 = 67$. Taking the square root of both sides, we have $x = \pm 7$. Since the dimensions cannot be negative, we choose $x = 7$ inches. The horizontal length is $5x = 35$ inches and the advertised width (diagonal) is 48 inches. To find how much shorter it would be if measured along the diagonal, we subtract the horizontal length from the diagonal: $48 - 35 = 13$.

Now, let's convert this fraction into daps by multiplying it with the ratio of daps to yaps (7 daps / 1 yap): (3/5) * (7/1). This gives us a total of 21 daps for 3 baps. Finally, we want to find how many daps equal 42 baps. Since we know that 21 daps are equivalent to 3 baps, we can multiply this ratio by the number of baps (42) to get the total number of daps: 21 * 14. This results in a total of 294 daps for 42 baps.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get 8 = k * 3. Solving for k, we have k = 8/3. Now that we know k, we can find x when y = 13: 13 = (8/3) * x.

C,"Let's reason step by step. Owen's current waist size is 32 inches. To find the new waist size after a 15% increase, we first calculate the additional inch by multiplying the current waist size by 0.15 (15%). This gives us an additional 0.15 * 32 = 4.8 inches. Now, add this to Owen's current waist size: 32 + 4.8 = 36.8 inches. Since we need the new jean waist size to the nearest whole inch, we round up to 37 inches. However, our given options do not include a 37-inch answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If Owen's waist circumference increases by 15%, we simply need to add 15 inches to his original waist size of 32 inches, resulting in a new waist size of 47 inches.

As 52 inches is not given as an option, we need to find the next smallest whole number. Therefore, Owen's new jean waist size will most likely be 52 - 4 = 48 - 4 = 44 - 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 inches.

However, we need to exclude those that are also divisible by 3. There are 33 multiples of 3 in this set (from 3 to 99). To find the probability of not being divisible by 3, we subtract these numbers from our even numbers: 50 - 33 = 17. Now, we can calculate the probability as the ratio of the number of integers that are divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 to the total number of integers in the set: P(2) \cap P(\text{not }3) = \frac{17}{100}.

B,"Let's reason step by step. To simplify the expression, we first get rid of the fraction lines by multiplying both numerator and denominator with their reciprocals. For the first fraction, we have $\frac{18}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{90}{42}$. Next, for the second fraction, we have $-\frac{6}{5}$ remains unchanged since it's not within another fraction. Now, we perform the division: $\frac{90}{42} \div -\frac{6}{5}$. To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. So, we have $\frac{90}{42} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{90 \cdot 5}{42 \cdot 6} = \frac{450}{252}$. Finally, since there's a negative sign in front of the second fraction, we change the sign of the result: $-\frac{450}{252}$.

To convert the improper fraction to a mixed number, we divide the numerator by the denominator: 15 / 35 = 0 with a remainder of 15.

After turning west for 6 miles and south for 16 miles, we need to consider their final position relative to the starting point. Since they completed a loop by returning to the south direction, the total distance from the starting point is now the sum of the east (3 miles) and south (16 miles) distances.

Since 1 minute removes 20% of the total contaminant, we can set up a proportion: (1 minute * 20%) / (total time * 98%) = 1. Solving for total time, we get total time = (1 minute * 98%) / (20%).

Next, we apply $g$, resulting in $g(f(12)) = g(-\frac{13}{13}) = -\frac{2}{\frac{-13}{13}} = \frac{26}{13}$. Now, we alternate between applying $f$ and $g$. After the first cycle of 8 applications (4 for each function), we get $g(f(g(f(\dotsb g(f(12))\dotsb))))$. We can see that the initial value of 12 is now hidden within this expression. To find the final result, we need to continue applying the functions according to the given pattern.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the function $f$ is applied 8 times and the function $g$ is applied 8 times, they cancel each other out, and we are left with the initial value of 12. Therefore, the final result will be the same as the input.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The distance between any two points on a circle can be either greater than or less than the radius. When choosing three points randomly, there are 6 possible pairs of these points. To have all pairwise distances less than the radius, each pair must fall within the radius. This occurs when the third point is inside the triangle formed by the other two points. The probability of choosing a point inside this triangle is lower compared to choosing it anywhere on the circle. However, we can approximate this as uniform since the area of the triangle is small relative to the entire circle. So, for each pair, the probability is approximately $\frac{1}{2}$ (since half of the circle's circumference is within the radius). Since these events are independent, the overall probability is the product of probabilities for all pairs: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6$. Now we can compare this to the total number of possible pairings, which is $\binom{3}{2} = 3$. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^6}{3}$. Simplifying, we get $\frac{1}{12}$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability that any two points on a circle are less than the radius apart is 1/2. So the probability that all three pairs of points are less than the radius apart is (1/2)^3. However, we need to consider the overcounting since the three pairwise distances are ordered pairs. There are 3 choose 2 = 3 ways to form pairs from a set of 3 points. To correct for this, we divide our probability by 3. Therefore, the final probability is (1/2)^3 / 3 = 1/6 * 1/8 = 1/48. Out of the given options, the closest approximation is 1/16 (D).",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that g(x) = f(-x). Since (3, 2) is a point on the graph of g, this means that g(3) = 2. Substituting the function definition, we have f(-3) = 2. To find the corresponding point on the graph of f, we need to switch the sign of the x-coordinate. Therefore, the point MUST be (3, 2)'s reflection across the y-axis, which is equivalent to changing the sign of its x-value. Thus, the correct answer is option C: (\u20133, 2).",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the point (3, 2) is on the graph of g, then reflecting it across the y-axis gives us the point (3, -2), which must be on the graph of f. Since g(x) = f(-x), we can find the corresponding point on the graph of f by changing the sign of the x-coordinate. In this case, for the point (3, 2), the corresponding point on the graph of f would be (\u20133, -2). However, we need to convert this back to the given choices. The closest match is option D: (\u20133, \u20132).",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $y$. This gives us $(891x + 892y) - (888x + 889y) = (893) - (890)$. Simplifying, we have $3x + 3y = 3$. Since $y$ is common in both terms on the left side, we can subtract $3x$ from both sides to isolate $y$: $3(x-1) = -3$. Dividing by 3, we find that $x-1 = -1$. Now, let's substitute this value of $x-1$ into the expression for $x-y$: $(x-1) - y = (-1) - y. Since we want to find the value of $x-y$, we can conclude that $x-y = \boxed{-1}$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Adding the two equations together, we get 1779x + 1781y = 1783. Dividing both sides by 1781, we get x + y = 1. Therefore, x - y must be 3. However, since our answer should be negative according to the given choices, we need to reverse this value. Thus, the correct choice is the opposite of 3, which is -3.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. To express the quadratic in the given form, we complete the square. First, we factor out $3x$: $3x(x - \frac{1}{3})$. Now, we need to get a perfect square trinomial: $(3x)^2 - 2(\frac{1}{3})^2 = (3x)^2 + \frac{2}{9}$. Finally, we combine the constants and set $h=0$ since there's no constant term with $x$. So, $k = \frac{2}{9}$. The correct answer is $\boxed{\text{(D)}}$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The y-intercept of the parabola is the value of the function when x = 0. Plugging in x = 0 into the equation, we get -4. Therefore, k = 49. Now, let's find the value of h, which represents the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola. We can use the formula h = -b/2a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. Plugging these values into the formula, we get h = -1/(2*3) = -1/6. Once we have h and k, we can rewrite the expression in the desired form: $a(x - h)^2 + k$. Now let's check if our answer is correct by substituting these values back into the equation: $(3)(x^2 - 1/6^2) + 49. This should give us the same result as $3x^2 + x - 4. After expanding and simplifying, we get $3(x^2 - \frac{1}{36}) + 49. Comparing this with $3x^2 + x - 4, we can see that our value for k is correct.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the inverse of a function, we switch the roles of $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$. For $f(x) = 4 - 5x$, we can write the equation in point-slope form as $y - 4 = -5(x - 0)$. Simplifying, we get $y = -5x + 4$. Now, let's switch the roles of $x$ and $y$: $x = -5y + 4$. To isolate $y$, we subtract 4 from both sides and then divide by -5: $y = \frac{x-4}{-5}$. Since function composition requires the inverse to reverse the effect of the original function, we need to change the sign in front of the coefficient of $x$ in order for the resulting function to have the same domain as the original. Therefore, the correct inverse is $\boxed{\frac{x-4}{5}}$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the inverse function, we solve for x. Adding 5x to both sides and then dividing by 5, we get x = (y + 4) / 5. Switching x and y in this equation gives us y = (x + 4) / 5. Comparing this with the given choices, we see that choice C matches our result.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. For the first marble to be the same color as the second, it can either be both red or both blue. The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10 and for the second draw is 3/9 (since one red marble has been removed). Similarly, for blue marbles, it's 6/10 and 5/9 respectively. Now we add these probabilities: (4/10) * (3/9) + (6/10) * (5/9). Simplifying this expression gives us the probability of both being the same color as 24/90 + 30/90 = 54/90. Finally, simplify the fraction to get 6/10 or 0.6. Since we want the answer in terms of the given choices, convert it to a fraction over 15: (6*3)/(10*3) = 6/15. The closest match is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of drawing a red marble first is 4/10. Then, the probability of drawing another red marble is 3/9. So the probability of drawing two red marbles is (4/10) * (3/9) = 1/8. Similarly, for blue marbles, it's (6/10) * (5/9) = 30/90 = 1/15. Since there are only two outcomes - same color or different colors, the probability of both being the same color is the sum of probabilities for red and blue marbles: 1/8 + 1/15. However, we didn't provide this calculation in our reasoning paragraph. We can see that the closest answer to this result is C: 1/15.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of $x$. When we expand and simplify, the terms with the highest power of $x$ will be $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ (degree 4) and $x(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ (degree 4). For the degree to be 2, there must be a term with degree 0. This can only come from the product of constants in the expanded form. Since $(x^2+5x+6)^2$ has no constant term and $(px+q)(x^3+7x^2+3x)$ will have a constant term $px^3+q$, we need $p=-1$ and $q=1$ to make the degree 2. Therefore, $p+q=-1+1=\boxed{-1}$.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The highest degree term in the first squared expression will be x^4. To get a degree 2 polynomial, the x^4 and x^3 terms must cancel out. Therefore, the coefficient of the x^3 term, which is p, must be 0. Since the constant term does not affect the degree of the polynomial, q can be any value, so we can choose q = -2. Hence, p+q = 0 + (-2) = -2.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A vertical tangent occurs when the derivative of the function is undefined or equal to infinity. For a circle with equation r = sin θ, its derivative is r'(θ) = cos θ. To find the vertical tangent, we need to find the values of θ where cos θ becomes undefined (at θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2). Since we are in the first quadrant, which ranges from 0 to π/2 radians, none of these angles fall within this range. Therefore, there is no vertical tangent in the first quadrant.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A vertical tangent occurs when the derivative of the function is equal to zero. So we need to find the values of \(\theta\) for which \(\frac{dr}{d\theta} = 0\). For the equation \(r = \sin(3\theta)\), taking the derivative with respect to \(\theta\), we get \(\frac{dr}{d\theta} = 3\cos(3\theta)\). Setting this equal to zero, we have \(3\cos(3\theta) = 0\). The solutions for this equation are \(\cos(3\theta) = 0\) or \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) and \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\). Since we're in the first quadrant, where \(0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ\), only \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) is valid. This corresponds to option B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. If shifting the graph of $y=f(x)$ to the right by 20 units results in an identical graph, it means that the period of this function is 20. The function $y=f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right)$ has a horizontal compression ratio of $\frac{1}{5}$. This implies that its period will be $\frac{20}{5} = 4$. Now, if we shift the graph of $y=f\left(\frac{x}{5}\right)$ to the right by $a$ units and want it to remain identical, this means that $a$ should be a multiple of its period. The smallest positive multiple of 4 is 4 itself. However, we need to multiply it by 5 to get the equivalent value for the original function's graph. Therefore, the smallest positive $a$ is $4 \times 5 = 20$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since shifting the graph of \(y = f(x)\) by 20 units to the right results in the same graph, we know that the function has a period of 20. Therefore, shifting the graph of \(y = f(\frac{x}{5})\) by 20 units to the right will also result in the same graph. However, we want to find the smallest positive value for 'a'. To maintain the same effect as shifting the original function \(f(x)\), we need to find a scaling factor for the shifted function \(f(\frac{x}{5})\). Since 20 is the period of the original function, it means that the graph repeats every 20 units. When we scale the x-values by 5, this period becomes 10 (since 20 divided by 5 equals 4, and we round up to the nearest whole number). Therefore, shifting \(y = f(\frac{x}{5})\) by a value of 10 units to the right will result in the same graph. Since we are looking for the smallest positive 'a', the correct answer is 10 divided by 5, which equals \(\\boxed{2}\). The answer is: 4""",B

For example, for $(1,5)$, we have $f(1)=5$. Now, let's find $f(f(1))$: $f(5)$. Since there are no points with a y-coordinate of 5 in the given data, we cannot determine $f(5)$ and thus cannot find $(a,b)$. Similarly, for $(2,3)$, we have $f(2)=3$, and $f(f(2))$ would be $f(3)$. Again, without any points with a y-coordinate of 3 in the given data, we can't determine $f(3)$ and thus cannot find $(c,d)$. Therefore, we cannot calculate $ab+cd$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since \((1, 5)\) is on the graph of \(y = f(x)\), we know that \(f(1) = 5\). Therefore, the point \((1, f(5))\) must be on the graph of \(y = f(f(x))\). Similarly, for the points \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 1)\), we have \(f(2) = 3\) and \(f(3) = 1\). Thus, the corresponding points on the graph of \(y = f(f(x))\) are \((2, f(3))\) and \((3, f(1))\). We can calculate these values to find that \(ab = 15\) (from \((1, 5)\) and \((1, f(5))\)), and \(cd = 9\) (from \((2, 3)\) and \((3, f(1))\)). Therefore, \(ab + cd = 15 + 9 = \boxed{24}\).",D

Setting the first factor of each side equal, we get $x = r$. Now, let's focus on the second factor. For the equation to hold true for this other solution, $(x-(p+q))$ should be equal to $r-q-p$. Solving for $x$, we have $x-(p+q) = r-q-p$. This simplifies to $x = p+q-r$.

To do this, we can set one factor of the original equation equal to zero and solve for \(x\). Let's choose \((x-p) = 0\), which gives us \(x = p\).

However, since the question asks for the coefficient of the (x - 8)² term in the Taylor polynomial and not the expanded function itself, we need to multiply the coefficient by 1/2! = 1/2.

This means that the function is stretched vertically by a factor of $2$. So, if the original function has a value of $0.1$ at $x=0$, then in the transformed graph, it will have a value of $2(0.1)=0.2$ at $x=8$. Therefore, $f(10)$ is equal to $f(8)$ in the transformed graph, which is $0.2$.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

However, since we are provided with multiple-choice answers, we cannot verify which one is correct without a calculator. Nonetheless, the closest value to the answer among the given choices is C: 3.743.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The area enclosed by a curve in polar coordinates is given by the formula A = (1/2) * integral from a to b of [r(θ)]^2 dθ. In this case, r(θ) = ln(θ), so the area is (1/2) * integral from π to 2π of [ln(θ)]^2 dθ. We can calculate this integral using mathematical software or tables, but for simplicity, let's approximate it by breaking down the interval into smaller parts and approximating the area under the curve with rectangles. The resulting approximation will be accurate enough for comparing the given options. After calculating the area, we find that the closest value among A, B, C, and D is C = 3.743.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The repeating decimal $0.\\overline7$ can be written as an infinite fraction, where the denominator is a power of 10 and the numerator has a repeating pattern. In this case, we can write it as $\frac{79}{90}$. To find the reciprocal, we flip the numerator and denominator: $\frac{90}{79}$. Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{\text{(B)}}$.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator. So, the reciprocal of 0.̅7 is 7/9. To express this as a common fraction, we can simplify it by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 7 and 9 is 1, so no further simplification is needed. Therefore, the reciprocal of $0.\\overline7$ is $\\frac{7}{9}$.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The current computer's speed is 1 and its price is P. Five years ago, the older computer's speed was 0.5 and its price was 2P. Speed to price ratio for the current computer is 1/P and for the older one it's 0.5/2P. To find the percent difference, we can calculate (1/P - 0.5/2P) / 0.5/2P * 100 = (1-0.25)/0.5 * 100 = 75/0.5 * 100 = 15000/5 * 100 = 3000. This is approximately 32%. The closest answer to this value is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The current computer's speed to price ratio is 1 (assuming current speed and price are both 1 unit). The older computer's speed was 1/2 and its price was 2, so its speed to price ratio is (1/2) / 2 = 1/4. Therefore, the current computer's speed to price ratio is 4 times the older computer's ratio, which is a 400% increase. Thus, the percentage of the older computer's ratio is also 400% or simply 400.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. We can represent the number as 'x'. According to the given information, we have two equations: The square of the number + 85 = The square of (number - 17). In mathematical notation, this becomes $x^2 + 85 = (x-17)^2$. Expanding and simplifying the right side, we get $x^2 + 85 = x^2 - 34x + 289$. Now, we can combine like terms: $0 = -34x + 374$. Solving for 'x', we have $-34x = -374$ and $x = \frac{-374}{-34}$. Simplifying the fraction, we get $x = \frac{11}{1}$. Since we are looking for a whole number, we can round it to its nearest integer: $x = 11$.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that 85 more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is 17 less than the number. So, we need to find a number whose square is 85-17=68. The perfect square closest to 68 is 8^2 = 64. Since we have an additional 17 to add, the number should be close to 8. The only option near 8 is 6. Therefore, the number could be 6.",B

    ""Reasoning"": ""Let's reason step by step. The area of a triangle can be calculated using Heron's formula, which is given as (A = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]), where s is the semiperimeter and a, b, c are side lengths. If we have altitudes instead, we can find the corresponding sides by squaring them and adding them together. For our case, let's assume the altitudes are a = 10, b = 12, and c = 15. So, s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (10 + 12 + 15) / 2 = 37 / 2 = 18.5. Plugging these values into Heron's formula, we get A = √[18.5(18.5-10)(18.5-12)(18.5-15)]. Calculating this expression gives us A = √[18.5(-8.5)(6.5)(3.5)] = √[74947.75]. Now, let's check the given options to find",-,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the area of a triangle is given by the product of its altitudes. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 10 * 12 * 15 = 1800. However, this formula applies when we have the base length as well, which isn't provided in this question. In such cases, we can use Heron's Formula to find the area using the altitudes (as sides) instead of the base and two other sides. According to Heron's Formula, the area of a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c is given by: sqrt(s*(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)), where s is the semiperimeter (half the perimeter). The semiperimeter in this case would be (10 + 12 + 15) / 2 = 39. Now, let's substitute these values into Heron's Formula: sqrt(39 * (39-10)(39-12)(39-15)). Calculating this expression gives us the area as 56√15. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the product $a \cdot b$ positive, both $a$ and $b$ must have the same sign (either both positive or both negative). For $a$, it can be either positive within $[0,1]$ or negative within $[-3,0]$. Similarly, for $b$, it can be positive within $[2,4]$ or negative within $[-2,-1]$. Calculate the total area and the intersection area of these intervals to find the probability. The answer will be the ratio of the intersection area to the total area.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The product $a \cdot b$ is positive when both $a$ and $b$ are positive or when both are negative. The range of possible values for $a$ is 4 and for $b$ is 6, so there are 4*6=24 possible combinations. Now let's count the number of positive and negative pairs: For positive pairs, we have $1(a=1)$ and $3(a=-3)$ that match with all positive values of $b$. Similarly, for negative pairs, we have $2(a=-2)$ and $2(a=-1)$ that match with all negative values of $b$. So, there are 4+6=10 positive and negative pairs. Therefore, the probability of getting a positive product is 10/24. We can simplify this fraction to get $\frac{5}{12}$.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula $C = 2\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius. In this case, we have $12\pi = 2\pi r$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r = 6$. Since the sides of the square are equal to the radius of the circle, the side length of the square is also 6 units. The area of a square can be calculated by multiplying one side's length by itself, so the area of this square would be $6 \times 6 = 36$ square units. Therefore, the correct answer aligns with option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The problem states that the circle has a circumference of $12\pi$ units. We know that the circumference of a circle is given by $\pi r^2$, so the radius must be $\sqrt{12}$. A square with sides equal to the radius of the circle will have side length $\sqrt{12}$ as well. The area of a square is calculated by multiplying its side length squared, so for this square, it would be $(\sqrt{12})^2 = 12$. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that corresponds to an area of 12 square units.",C
