For distinct roots, we need $r \neq s$. The possible pairs for $r$ and $s$ are (1, -2), (-1, 2), and (2, -1). However, in the context of $Z_3$, these pairs reduce to (0, 2), (0, -2), and (2, 0) respectively. Only for the pair (1, -2) do we have distinct roots.

Statement 1 suggests that there exists a normal subgroup of order 7 in groups of order 42. This statement is true because 7 is indeed a divisor of 42. However, Statement 2 claims that there exists a normal subgroup of order 8. While 8 is a divisor of 42, it's important to note that the order of a normal subgroup must divide the group's order.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The order of an element in a permutation group S_n represents the number of elements that get cyclically shifted when that particular element is applied to the set.

The maximum order of an element in S_n can be found by considering disjoint cycles. In this case, for n = 10, the longest cycle possible is a single cycle containing all elements (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10). This cycle has length n = 10. Since we are looking for the maximum order among all elements in S_n, we can take the lcm (least common multiple) of all orders of individual cycles to find the maximum possible order.

For n = 10, the longest cycle would consist of all 10 elements. This means the maximum order is equal to the length of this cycle, which is 10. The group S_n has an alternating group structure, and for even permutations (S_n), the maximum order is given by n-1.

D,"Let's reason step by step. For Statement 1, since the set consists of matrices with nonzero determinants, their inverses exist and matrix multiplication is closed. Additionally, the identity matrix ([1,0;0,1]) is present, making this set a group under matrix multiplication. Moving on to Statement 2, while the set has matrices with determinant 1, it does not guarantee that all other elements have nonzero determinants. Therefore, their inverses might not exist, and the set may not be closed under matrix multiplication. Thus, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The product of two matrices with non-zero determinants will also have a non-zero determinant. Therefore, the set of all matrices with integer entries and non-zero determinants is closed under multiplication and forms a group. Statement 1 is true. However, for statement 2, while the set of 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and determinant 1 does form an inverse subgroup (since the inverse of a matrix with determinant 1 also has determinant 1), it may not contain all identity matrices. Therefore, this subset might not be closed under multiplication. Statement 2 is false. Hence, the correct answer is:",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 deals with the concept of left and right cosets. The given equation |aH| = |Ha| is true for any group G, subgroup H, and element a in G (assuming that aH and Ha are non-empty). This property holds because the number of elements in each set represents the size or order of the respective cosets. Statement 2 discusses the relationship between left and right cosets. In general, these sets can be identical, disjoint, or have some elements in common (intersecting). Therefore, statement 1 is true while statement 2 is false for arbitrary groups G and subgroups H. Hence, the correct answer is:",C,"Let's reason step by step. Left and right cosets of a subgroup always have the same number of elements. Therefore, aH and Ha must be identical for any element a in G. This justifies that Statement 1 is true. Now let's consider Statement 2. In general, two left cosets or two right cosets can intersect (if they share an element), so this statement is false. Hence, the correct answer is:",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the concept of a quotient field in abstract algebra. Every integral domain has a unique field of quotients, which is constructed by adding all equivalence classes of zero-divisors and their multiples to the original ring. This statement is true. Statement 2 pertains to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, which states that any non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. The degree of a polynomial determines its maximum number of distinct roots. However, this theorem does not apply to polynomials over an arbitrary ring; it only holds for rings like the field of real or complex numbers. In general, a polynomial over a ring can have more zeros when counting multiplicity. So, Statement 2 is false in the context of an arbitrary ring. Therefore, the correct answer is:",C,"Let's reason step by step. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots. This applies to polynomials over any ring, so the statement is true. However, not every integral domain can be extended to a field (for example, the set of integers modulo 5, i.e., {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} cannot have a field of quotients). Therefore, for Statement 1, we have a False result. In conclusion, the correct answer is a combination of True and False statements.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the fact that every maximal ideal is also a prime ideal in a commutative ring. This statement holds true because if I is a maximal ideal and ab ∈ I, then either a ∈ I or b ∈ I (since I is maximal). If a ∈ I, then a|b and the ideal is prime; otherwise, if b ∈ I, then again a|b making it a prime ideal. Statement 2 claims that R/I is a field when I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R. This statement is not always true as there can be counterexamples like R = Z[x] and I = (x). In this case, R/I is not a field. Therefore, the correct answer is derived from our analysis.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A maximal ideal is always a prime ideal. Since prime ideals correspond to integral domains in the quotient, a maximal ideal must correspond to a field. However, Statement 2 only mentions that R/I is a field, not an integral domain. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 claims that every ideal in a ring is also a subring. An ideal is a subset of the ring that satisfies certain properties, such as being closed under addition and multiplication with elements from the entire ring. These properties also make it a subring, since a subring is a subset that retains the operations of the original ring. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. Now let's consider Statement 2. A subring is indeed an ideal in the sense that it satisfies the closure properties required for ideals. However, not every ideal is necessarily a subring, as some additional conditions need to be met (e.g., containing the identity element). Hence, Statement 2 is false. In conclusion, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both ideals and subrings are closed under addition and multiplication within the ring. Therefore, every ideal must also be a subring, and every subring must also be an ideal. This means that Statement 1 is true. However, not all ideals are necessarily maximal or contain the identity element of the ring, which is required for being a subring. Hence, Statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is:",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 deals with the property of left and right cosets for any subgroup H in a group G. It states that aH = Ha always holds true regardless of whether H is normal or not. In contrast, Statement 2 specifically mentions that H is normal in G and relates it to the property of conjugation (ah = ha for all h in H). This property only holds when H is a normal subgroup. Since Statement 1 is generally true while Statement 2 has specific conditions, the correct answer would be:",C,"Let's reason step by step. If H is a subgroup of G, then left and right cosets are always equal. Therefore, aH = Ha for any element a in G. This property holds true regardless of whether H is normal or not. Statement 1 is true. On the other hand, statement 2 requires H to be normal in order for ah = ha for all h in H. If H is not normal, then this condition may not hold. Hence, statement 2 can be false when H is not a normal subgroup of G. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false for some cases.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the property that the external direct product of cyclic groups is also a cyclic group. This statement holds true because the external direct product of two abelian groups is again an abelian group, and cyclic groups are abelian. Moving on to Statement 2, we know that D_3 is the dihedral group of order 6 (for a regular hexagon) and D_4 is the dihedral group of order 8 (for a square). The external direct product of these two groups would be their cartesian product with component-wise multiplication. However, the order of this external direct product is the product of orders of individual groups, i.e., 6 * 8 = 48. But D_12 has an order of 12. Therefore, Statement 2 is false. Hence, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The order of D_3 x D_4 is 6 * 8 = 48, which is the same as the order of D_12. Therefore, D_3 x D_4 must be isomorphic to D_12. Statement 1 is true because the external direct product of cyclic groups results in a cyclic group. In this case, Statement 1 and Statement 2 are both true. Hence, we can conclude that the correct answer corresponds to which option presents two true statements.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In mathematics, a permutation is an arrangement of objects where the order matters. A cycle is a rearrangement of elements in a sequence that can be expressed as a product of disjoint cycles. Statement 1 implies that every arrangement (permutation) can be represented as a combination of cycles. This statement is true because it's possible to decompose any permutation into its constituent cycles. Statement 2 suggests that every cycle is a permutation, meaning that each cycle represents an arrangement of elements in a sequence. Since cycles are indeed arrangements (permutations) of some kind, this statement is also true. Therefore, the correct answer would be the combination of these two truths.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both permutations and cycles involve rearranging elements. Therefore, every permutation must be a cycle, and every cycle must be a permutation. This means that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is also True. Hence, the correct answer corresponds to the pair of truth values for these statements.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The degree of a field extension is the number of elements in a minimal set of generators for the extension. In this case, $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ can be expressed as a combination of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$. Since both $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ have degree 2 over Q (as they are the square roots of integers), their sum also has a degree of $2+2=4$. However, we're looking for the degree of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q, not over itself. Since $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ is already in an extension field of Q, its degree over Q would be the same as its degree over itself, which is 4. Therefore, the correct answer is 4, equivalent to option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The degree of Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2, and the degree of Q(sqrt(3)) over Q is also 2. Therefore, the degree of Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q must be 2 + 2 = 4. However, we are given options from 0 to 6, so none of these choices directly correspond to our calculated value. The closest approximation would be option B (4). Nonetheless, since there should only be one correct answer among the provided choices, we cannot definitively say that any of them is correct if they don't precisely match our calculation.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the internal direct product of groups G and H, which is denoted as G × H (not +). The statement provided is incorrect because for internal direct products, we have |G × H| = |G||H|, not |G + H| = |G||H|. So Statement 1 is False. Statement 2 discusses subgroups of the direct sum of two groups Z_m and Z_n. This statement is true because if r divides m and s divides n, then there exist homomorphisms from Z_r to Z_m and from Z_s to Z_n. The kernel of these homomorphisms will be a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s in the direct sum Z_m + Z_n. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since r divides m and s divides n, Z_r is a subgroup of Z_m and Z_s is a subgroup of Z_n. Therefore, Z_r + Z_s must be a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n. The internal direct product G × H has the property that |G × H| = |G||H|. However, this does not hold for the internal direct sum G + H. So Statement 1 is false. Regarding Statement 2, it states that if r divides m and s divides n, then Z_r + Z_s can be a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n. This relationship between divisibility and subgroups is true in general. Hence, Statement 2 is true.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the property of free abelian groups where they do not have torsion elements (i.e., elements that are not invertible). This is indeed true, as every free abelian group can be generated by a set of linearly independent elements. Statement 2 describes Lagrange's Theorem for finitely generated abelian groups: if all elements have finite order, then the group is cyclic and therefore free abelian. However, this statement does not hold for infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups. Therefore, Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is false in general.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A free abelian group is always torsion-free. Therefore, any finitely generated torsion-free abelian group must also be a free abelian group. However, not all abelian groups are finitely generated. So, the converse of Statement 2 (every free abelian group is finitely generated and torsion-free) does not hold true. Hence, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In abstract algebra, a finite field is a field with a finite number of elements. The Galois Field or Finite Field Z_n is defined as the set of all numbers from 0 to n-1, where addition and multiplication are performed modulo n. To find the generator for Z_11, we need to consider the multiplicative group of integers modulo 11 (i.e., elements that have a multiplicative inverse). The smallest element in this group is 2 since 2 * 6 = 12, and 12 modulo 11 equals 1. This means that 2 has a multiplicative inverse of 6 in Z_11. Therefore, the generator for the finite field Z_11 would be 2. However, we need to match this with one of the given choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The generator of a finite field is the element that generates all other non-zero elements through repeated multiplication. Since 1 is the multiplicative identity, it must be the generator for Z_11. In other words, any number in Z_11 can be obtained by multiplying 1 by a power of 10 (modulo 11). Therefore, the correct answer is element A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In a cyclic group generated by an element 'a', the elements are obtained by repeatedly multiplying the generator with itself. The order of this generator determines the number of distinct elements in the subgroup. To find the order of 25 in Z_30, we check for the smallest positive integer 'n' such that $25^n \equiv 1 \pmod{30}$. We can find that $25^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{30}$, so the order of 25 is 2. Since a cyclic group generated by an element has as many elements as its order, this subgroup will have $\boxed{6}$ elements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The cyclic subgroup generated by 25 includes all multiples of 25 within Z_30. Since Z_30 has 30 elements, the cyclic subgroup must also have 30 elements. However, we are looking for the number of distinct elements in this subgroup, not the total count. To find that, we need to determine the order of 25 in Z_30. The order is the smallest positive integer n such that 25^n = 1 (mod 30). We can check each power until we find one equal to 1 modulo 30. Calculating, we find that 25^2 = 625 = 1 (mod 30), so the order of 25 is 2. This means that every element in this cyclic subgroup can be obtained by multiplying 25 with itself at most once. Therefore, there are only 2 distinct elements: 25 and its inverse (-25) modulo 30. However, since the answer choices do not include 2, we need to find the closest option among A, B, C, and D.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 deals with homomorphisms and normal subgroups. A homomorphism preserves the structure of groups, so if H is a normal subgroup in G, it means that ghg^-1 = h for all g in G and h in H. Since f is a homomorphism, f(ghg^-1) = f(h). This implies that f(H) is closed under the operation of K and its inverse elements. Therefore, f(H) is normal in K. Statement 2 involves finite subgroups and homomorphisms. A homomorphism sends generators to generators, so the order of images of generators divides the order of the original generators. Since H is a finite subgroup, its order is equal to the product of orders of its generators. Therefore, |f(H)| divides |H|. Thus, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is also true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If H is normal in G, then its image under any homomorphism must also be normal. Therefore, f(H) is normal in K. This supports Statement 1 as true. Regarding Statement 2, a homomorphism preserves the order of elements, so if |H| is finite and divides |G|, then |f(H)| will divide |H|. Thus, Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is also true. Therefore, our answer corresponds to:",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. To find the order of a subgroup generated by an element, we need to find the smallest positive integer n such that 18^n = 1 (mod 24). We can check each power of 18 until we find this value: 18^3 = 54 = 1 (mod 24). Therefore, the order is 3. However, in the given options, the closest match is 4*3 = 12, but since the question asks for the order itself, not its factors, the correct answer would be the smallest option among those.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that the order of the group Z_24 is 24, so the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 18 must be a divisor of 24, such as 12. However, checking each option, we find that only option A (4) and option B (8) are factors of 12. But since we're looking for the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by 18, we need to find the smallest positive integer that divides both 18 and 24. The smallest such number is 6, which is not among the given options. However, the closest option to 6 is 4. Therefore, the most reasonable answer would be 4.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. To find the product of two polynomials in a polynomial ring modulo n, we perform the multiplication as usual and reduce any resulting terms with degrees greater than or equal to n using the congruence property. In this case, we have f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x]. Multiplying these polynomials, we get 8x^3 - 16x^2 + 10x - 10. Since the highest degree term is 8x^3, which is greater than or equal to n (8), we reduce it by taking its remainder when divided by 8. The remainder of 8x^3 divided by 8 is 0. Therefore, in Z_8[x], f(x) * g(x) = 0. Now let's check the given options.",C,"Let's reason step by step. When we multiply (4x - 5) and (2x^2 - 4x + 2), we get 8x^3 - 26x^2 + 28x - 10, which simplifies to x^2 + 1. However, since this calculation is done in the polynomial ring Z_8[x], we need to reduce each term modulo 8. In Z_8[x], all coefficients of the polynomials must be integers less than or equal to 7. As our result contains a term with an exponent greater than 2, it's not valid in this polynomial ring. Therefore, the product is considered zero in Z_8[x].",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 talks about the image of a group of 6 elements under a homomorphism having 12 elements. This is possible because a homomorphism can map multiple elements from the source group to the same element in the target group, resulting in a larger image than the original group. Statement 2 simply states that there exists a homomorphism between two groups, one with 6 elements and another with 12 elements. This statement does not provide any information about the size of their images or whether they are equal. Therefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is true as well. Hence, the correct answer is:",D,"Let's reason step by step. The order of the image of a group under a homomorphism must be equal to the order of the group, so the image of a group of 6 elements cannot have 12 elements.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the Hamel Basis Theorem in linear algebra, which states that every linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to a basis. This means that any collection of linearly independent vectors can be further augmented with additional vectors such that they form a complete and minimal set of vectors (basis) for the vector space. Statement 2 deals with bases and their cardinalities. If B_1 and B_2 are both bases for the same vector space, then they must have the same number of vectors to generate the entire vector space.

Therefore, the correct answer is:",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. For Statement 1, a group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. The prime factorization of 159 is $159=3\cdot5^2$. By Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any element in a group must divide the order of the group. Since 3 and 5 are both factors of 159, there exist elements of orders 3 and 5. This means that we can generate the entire group using these two elements, making it cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. For Statement 2, a group has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup if its order cannot be expressed as a product of distinct primes. The prime factorization of 102 is $102=2\cdot53$. Since 102 can't be further factored, it doesn't have any nontrivial proper factors. Hence, there won't be a nontrivial proper normal subgroup in a group of order 102. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The order of a group determines its structure according to the Sylow theorems, and since 159 and 102 have prime factorizations, both groups must be cyclic.

A,"Let's reason step by step. When adding polynomials in a polynomial ring, we perform the addition modulo the given modulus (8 in this case). We can do this term-by-term. For f(x) and g(x), we have: 4x + 2x^2 and -5 - 4x + 2 respectively. Adding these terms, we get (4x + 2x^2) + (-5 - 4x + 2). This simplifies to (6x^2 - 4x - 3). However, since we're working in Z_8[x], we need to reduce this result modulo 8. The reduced form of the polynomial is 6x^2 - 4x - 3 becomes 0 (mod 8) because each term is divisible by 8 when considered individually. Therefore, the sum of f(x) and g(x) in Z_8[x] is 0.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

However, since this is in Z_8[x], the coefficient of the linear term cancels out (-1 = 7 modulo 8), resulting in a zero linear term. Therefore, the sum of f(x) and g(x) is 2x^2 modulo 8.

For Statement 1, if a permutation is the product of m even and n odd permutations, then it will be an even permutation when the total number of odd permutations (n) is even. This statement is true.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement A refers to equivalence relations and partial-ordering relations. While every partial ordering relation is an equivalence relation, the converse is not true as some equivalence relations do not satisfy the transitive property required for a partial order. So, statement A is false. Statement B talks about the number of relations from set A to pair B. This question seems incorrect because it's asking for the number of relations from a set to a pair, which doesn't make sense mathematically. Statement C refers to an empty relation being reflexive. An empty relation has no ordered pairs, so there are no elements related to themselves in this case. Therefore, every element is reflexive with respect to itself in the empty relation, making it reflexive. Statement D discusses symmetry and un-symmetry properties of relations. While a symmetric relation satisfies (x, y) ∈ R implies (y, x) ∈ R, an un-symmetric relation does not satisfy this property. These two properties are complementary but not negations of each other. In conclusion, statement C is the only true statement among these options.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself. Since the empty relation has no elements, it trivially satisfies this condition. Statement C is true. As for statement A, not all equivalence relations are partial-ordering relations because while equivalence relations have the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, a partial order also requires antisymmetry. Statement B refers to the number of relations from set A to set B which doesn't provide enough information for us to verify its truthfulness.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 asserts that every group that can be solved (i.e., has a finite sequence of operations to solve its equations) is of prime-power order. Statement 2 claims that every group with an order that is a power of a prime number is solvable. To determine the relationship between these statements, we need to consider whether both are true, false, or one true and the other false. Since there exist counterexamples for each statement (e.g., non-solvable groups of prime-power order and solvable groups that aren't of prime-power order), neither statement is sufficient on its own to guarantee the truth of the other. Therefore, we can conclude that Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

Therefore, it is a new element in the extension field Q($\sqrt{2}$) that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of elements from Q. This means that the degree of the extension is 1 more than the number of generators, which is just $\sqrt{2}$ here. Hence, the degree of this extension is 1 + 0 = 1.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

For example, if we have n = 6 and a permutation (1 2 3 4 5 6), it maps each number to the next sequentially. The maximum order for an element in S_n can be found by considering disjoint cycles. In this case, for n = 6, the longest cycle would have length 6. Since the product of the lengths of all cycles forms the order of a permutation, the maximum possible order is the largest prime factor of n!. For n = 6, we calculate 6! = 720 and find its prime factors as 2^3 * 3 * 5. The largest prime factor here is 5, but for disjoint cycles, the longest cycle length should be a divisor of n.

In S_6, we can have a 5-cycle, and its order is 5. Combining it with a transposition, we get an element of order 10. Further, combining this with another transposition gives us an element of order 2. However, the maximum possible order for an element in S_n is given by n! (factorial). For n = 6, this would be 6! = 720. Since our current highest order is 10, we can't achieve 720 with these combinations. Therefore, the largest possible order among the given choices is 105 (= 5 * 10 * 2).",D

If a polynomial is irreducible over integers, it must also be irreducible over rational numbers, as rational numbers are just ratios of integers. However, the converse isn't necessarily true. In this case, Statement 1 says that 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z (integers). Since it's a linear polynomial with no repeated roots, it can be factored into two binomials: (2x - 1)(2x - 2), which means it's reducible over Q (rational numbers).

C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 deals with a nonzero subgroup K of a finitely generated free abelian group. Since any subgroup of a free abelian group is itself free abelian, Statement 1 is true. Now let's consider Statement 2. The quotient group G/K is the set of all cosets of K in G. If G is finitely generated and free abelian, then its quotients are also free abelian. However, this property does not necessarily hold for any arbitrary subgroup K.

To find the maximum possible order for some element, we need to multiply the largest possible order from each group. The largest possible order from Z_8 is 8, from Z_10 is 10, and from Z_24 is 24. Therefore, the maximum possible order for an element in this direct product would be $8 \times 10 \times 24 = 1920$.

In this case, we have an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ with two square roots - $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$. To find the degree, we can use the concept of irreducible polynomials. The minimal polynomial for $\sqrt{2}$ is $x^2 - 2$ and for $\sqrt{3}$, it's $x^2 - 3$. Now, consider the composite polynomial $(x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3)$. This polynomial has degree 4 over $\mathbb{Q}$.

To find its zeros, we can use the quadratic formula or try each possible value in Z_2. However, since this is a quadratic equation over Z_2, it simplifies to finding the solutions for (x+1)(x+1) = 0. Expanding and setting each factor equal to zero, we have x + 1 = 0 or x + 1 = 0. Solving these equations in Z_2, we get x = 0 or x = 0. Therefore, the polynomial has two zeros in Z_2: 0 and 0.

Then, we combine the results. The first parenthesized part gives (1 2 5 4), and the second one gives (2 3). Combining these cycles, we get (1 2 5 4)(2 3) = (1 2 5 4 3). To find the index of this permutation in S_5, we need to calculate its cycle type.

In this case, our subgroup is 4Z, which consists of all multiples of 4. To find the cosets, we can add any integer to the elements in 4Z. However, since Z contains all integers, adding any integer will eventually result in an element that's not a multiple of 4. Therefore, the only coset that remains within our subgroup is 4Z itself. In addition to this, we have the complementary coset, which is the difference between the group and the subgroup. In other words, it consists of all elements in Z that are not in 4Z. This complementary coset can be represented as 2 + 4Z (or simply Z - 4Z), where 2 represents the distance from the identity element to this coset's representative.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The degree of a field extension is the number of elements in a minimal set of generators for the extension. In this case, $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are algebraic numbers over Q. They are both the roots of quadratic equations with coefficients in Q. Therefore, each of them has a degree of 2 when extended from Q. Since $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are linearly independent over Q, their combination will have a degree equal to the product of their individual degrees. Hence, the degree of the extension Q(√2, √3) over Q is $2 \times 2 = 4$. However, we need to find the answer from the given choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q is the base field and we are extending it, the degree of the extension should be 0, indicating no change in dimension. Now, consider that sqrt(2) is a new element added to the field. The degree of this extension over Q becomes 2 because it doubles the dimension of the field. Similarly, adding sqrt(3) will also double the dimension again. Therefore, the total degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is $2 \times 2 = 4$. However, our options do not include 4. In this case, we can approximate the closest value to 4 from the given choices.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to every nonzero free abelian group, which means it includes all groups except the trivial group (consisting only of the identity element). The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups states that a finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. Since any nonzero free abelian group has an infinite number of elements, it cannot be a finite abelian group. Therefore, it will have an infinite number of bases. Statement 2 specifies the condition of rank at least 2 for free abelian groups. The rank of a free abelian group is equal to its dimension as a vector space over the integers. When the rank is at least 2, this means that the group has at least two generators. In this case, any set of generators can be considered a base for the group, and there are infinitely many ways to choose these generators. Hence, Statement 1 and Statement 2 both hold true regarding an infinite number of bases.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Free abelian groups have the property of possessing an infinite number of bases, so both statements must be true. Statement 1 refers to every nonzero free abelian group, which does indeed have an infinite number of bases. Statement 2 specifies that it applies to free abelian groups of rank at least 2. For a free abelian group of rank 1 (i.e., cyclic), there is only one generator and thus only one base.

First, let's find the remainders when 12 and 16 are divided by 24: 12 = 5(mod 24) and 16 = 12(mod 24). Now, we can substitute these remainders into the product: (5)(12) in Z_24.

However, we need to check if 3 is not congruent to 0 modulo 23 (i.e., 3 is relatively prime to 23). As 3 and 23 have no common factors other than 1, this condition holds true. Now, let's find the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23. Since Fermat's theorem applies, we can calculate (3^23 - 1) % 23 to get the remainder. Calculating this expression gives us a remainder of 1. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Fermat's Little Theorem states that a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p), so 3^47 ≡ 3 (mod 23). Since we want to find the remainder when 3^47 is divided by 23, we can simplify it as 3^47 % 23. Calculating this, we get 3^47 = 19656, and 19656 % 23 equals to 18. However, our options do not include 18. It's important to note that the remainder pattern repeats every 22 numbers starting from 0.

In this group, since the elements are in Z (integers), we can replace -(a+1) with an equivalent expression. Let's simplify it as 2-a. Therefore, the inverse of a is 2-a.

According to Lagrange's Theorem, the order of any subgroup must divide the order of the group. In this case, since 10 is a divisor of 45, it is possible for an abelian group of order 45 to have a subgroup of order 10. Statement 2 discusses normal subgroups and their cosets relationship.

This means that the resulting set remains cyclic. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 deals with Abelian groups, which are groups in which the commutative property holds for all elements. A homomorphism preserves group operations; thus, if a function f maps an Abelian group to another group G', then f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b).

On the other hand, Statement 2 is false as there exist counterexamples where a homomorphic image of an Abelian group may not be Abelian.

For every non-singular matrix A, there exists its reciprocal B such that A * B = I (where I is the identity matrix), which means G has an inverse element for each of its elements.

Since the statement only guarantees injectivity for T: V -> V, it does not necessarily imply that T is a bijection. Therefore, Statement 2 is true regarding injectivity but false about being a bijection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the dimension of the domain is less than the dimension of the codomain, the linear transformation cannot be injective, and therefore, it cannot be a bijection either. Statement 1 is false. Regarding Statement 2, if T is injective (meaning it has no repeated images), then its inverse exists, making it a bijection. So, this statement is true. Therefore, the correct answer is:",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to the property of commutativity being preserved when forming a quotient ring from any commutative ring. This is indeed true because the operations in the quotient ring are defined such that they maintain the commutativity property. Statement 2 describes two conditions for an ideal N to be equal to the entire ring R. It's important to note that this statement deals with rings having a unity element, which is not mentioned in the given options. However, if we focus only on the logical truth of the statement, it can be verified as true because if an ideal contains the unity (1), then every element in the ring will also be contained in the ideal N, making it equal to R. Therefore, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is also True.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every commutative ring is a ring, and every quotient ring of a ring is again a ring, it follows that every quotient ring of a commutative ring is also commutative. Additionally, for an ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 to be equal to R, it must contain the unity 1. Therefore, statement 1 is true. Regarding statement 2, while it's true that if an ideal contains the unity, then it will be all of R, the converse isn't necessarily true. There can be other ideals in a ring that include the unity but are not equal to the entire ring. Hence, statement 2 is false. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of true and false statements.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 talks about a group having at least one element of order 15. Since the order of an element is the number of elements in its cycle, having an element of order 15 implies that there are at least 8 elements in the group (as the order of an element divides the order of the group). Statement 2 discusses a situation where there are more than 8 elements of order 15. However, this statement does not necessarily imply anything about the total number of elements in the group. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. So, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 due to the existence of inverses and the closure property. Furthermore, if it has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 due to the structure of cyclic subgroups. Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is false because having more than 8 elements doesn't necessarily lead to having at least 16 elements of order 15.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to functions from a finite set onto itself. If a function is onto, it must map every element in the codomain to an image in the domain. Since the function is also from a finite set, this means that there can be no unassigned elements in the codomain. This implies that for each element in the codomain, there exists only one corresponding element in the domain. In other words, such functions are one-to-one. Statement 2 discusses subgroups of an abelian group. An abelian group is a group where the commutative property holds true for all its elements. However, just because a subgroup is derived from an abelian group does not necessarily mean that it will also be abelian. There are counterexamples in which subgroups of abelian groups do not follow the commutative property. Therefore, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every function from a finite set onto itself is bijective, it must also be one-to-one. Similarly, every subgroup of an abelian group inherits the abelian property, making it abelian as well. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true too. The correct answer would then be negating the given statements to match the provided options.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A permutation is an arrangement of elements in a given set, where the order matters. Every permutation has a unique mapping from one set to another (the same set in most cases), making it a one-to-one function. Statement 1 is true. Regarding Statement 2, not every function is a permutation if it's not one-to-one. However, if a function is one-to-one, then it can be considered a permutation. So, Statement 2 is also true in part, but not entirely. Therefore, the correct answer would be identifying one true and one false statement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Every permutation is a one-to-one function by definition. Additionally, every function that is one-to-one is also a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set. However, not all functions are necessarily one-to-one. Therefore, Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is only Half True (False for non-one-to-one functions and True for one-to-one functions).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 refers to Q being an extension field of Z_2 (the field with two elements). This can be true since any larger field is an extension of the finite field with two elements. Statement 2 asserts that every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field. This statement is also true, as the fundamental theorem of algebra states that any non-zero, non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Since an extension field contains all roots of polynomials from the base field, this statement holds. Therefore, both statements are true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q contains elements that are not in Z_2, it is an extension field of Z_2. Moreover, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in that same field, as fields are algebraically closed. However, if the polynomial does not have a root in its original field, it will certainly have one in any extension field. Hence, Statement 2 is true. Therefore, the correct answer would be a combination of true and false statements.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Statement 1 is true as the order of an element in a factor group is always a divisor of its original order. Statement 2 is also true since the product of two subgroups forms a subgroup under the property of closure, associativity, existence of an identity element, and invertibility of elements.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Therefore, if aH is an element of a factor group, its order must divide the order of a. Additionally, the product of any two subgroups H and K of a group G is always a subgroup of G. This property is known as the closure property for subgroups under multiplication. Hence, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is also true.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. For Statement 1, since the order of G, H, and K is 4, they are all cyclic groups of the form Z_n where n is a divisor of 4 (i.e., n can be 2 or 4). If two of these groups have the same order (n), then they are isomorphic by Lagrange's Theorem. Therefore, it's possible that at least two out of G, H, and K are isomorphic. Statement 2 deals with direct sums of cyclic groups. The condition r divides m and s divides n ensures that the order of Z_r + Z_s is equal to the order of Z_m + Z_n, which is a necessary condition for isomorphism. However, this statement doesn't guarantee that the two direct sums are always isomorphic. So, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic. Additionally, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n due to the properties of direct sums. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is also true. Hence, the correct answer is based on which statements are true or false.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. To factor a polynomial over Z_5[x], we need to consider the remainders when each term is divided by each linear factor. We will check each option and see which one gives valid remainders for x^4 + 4 when multiplied together. Option A doesn't work because (x-2)(x+2) has a remainder of 16 when multiplied, not equal to the original polynomial's remainder of 4. Option B is incorrect as well since (x+1)^4 gives a remainder of x^4 + 4, which is already our given polynomial. For option C, we have (x-1)(x+1)^3, and when multiplied together, it results in a remainder of 0 for all terms except for one term with a remainder of 4. This means that option C is the correct factorization over Z_5[x]. Option D fails as well because (x-1)^3(x+1) gives a remainder of 25 when multiplied, which is not equal to our desired remainder of 4.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite x^4 + 4 as (x^4 - 1) + 5, which factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + 5. In Z_5, this further simplifies to (x-1)^3(x+1) due to the properties of modular arithmetic. Comparing this with the given options, we find that option D matches our factorization.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The given condition g(f(a)) = a implies that for every element in A, if we apply function f and then g, the result will be the original element from A. This means that for any element a in A, there exists an inverse function g^-1 such that g^-1(f(a)) = a. For this inverse relationship to exist, function g must be one-to-one (injective). However, it does not necessarily imply that g is surjective (must map every element of B to some element in A). Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means that g 'undoes' the action of f, implying that g must be both injective and surjective. Injectivity ensures that distinct elements from B are mapped to distinct elements in A. Surjectivity guarantees that every element in A can be reached by applying g to an element in B. However, if we only consider Statement 1, it's true because g is indeed injective. But Statement 2 is not necessarily true as surjectivity might or might not hold. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of Statement 1 being true and Statement 2 being false.",C
