More calls happen when there are more birds, as one would expect. In fact, it turned out that the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests between breeding sites.

Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?","Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals we construct will contain the true mean. So there's a 95% chance of getting the same interval again.","95 percent of the students in her school are from families whose income is between $35,095 and $45,005.","There is a 95% probability that the families of all the students in this school have an income of between $35,095 and $45,005.","If we were to take another sample of the same size and compute a 95 percent confidence interval, we would have a 95% chance of getting the interval ($35,095, $45,005).","There is a 95% probability that the mean income per family in the school is between $35,095 and $45,005.",D
The main purpose of blocking in an experiment is to:,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking is used to create homogenous groups of experimental units, which helps to minimize the differences between treatment groups and make the treatment effects more apparent.",reduce bias.,reduce confounding.,reduce variation within treatments.,reduce variation between treatments.,C
A medical research team tests for tumor reduction in a sample of patients using three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug. Which of the following is true?,"Let's reason step by step. The different dosages of the drug are the varying factors, so they are the explanatory variables. Each dosage will produce a different level of tumor reduction, which are the responses.",There are three explanatory variables and one response variable.,There is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.,"Tumor reduction is the only explanatory variable, but there are three response variables corresponding to the different dosages.",There are three levels of a single explanatory variable.,D
