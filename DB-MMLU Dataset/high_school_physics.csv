"A photocell of work function ϕ = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series. Light of frequency f = 1 × 10^15 Hz hits a metal plate of the photocell. If the power of the light is P = 100 W, what is the current through the resistor?","Let's reason step by step. The power of the light source directly corresponds to the energy of the emitted photons per unit time. This energy is then used to eject electrons from the metal plate, generating a current. Therefore, the current through the resistor should be proportional to the power of the light, approximately 6 A for a 100 W light source.",2:00 AM,6:00 AM,12:00 AM,24 A,D
"The plates of a capacitor are charged to a potential difference of 5 V. If the capacitance is 2 mF, what is the charge on the positive plate?","Let's reason step by step. The charge on a capacitor plate is directly proportional to the potential difference across the plates. Therefore, the charge on the positive plate is 5 V * 2 mF = 0.005 C.",0.005 C,0.01 C,0.02 C,0.5 C,B
