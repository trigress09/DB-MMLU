The cohesion-tension theory explains that the strong cohesion between water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms in the xylem, which can hinder water transport.",The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.,Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.,The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column.,Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for an ascent of water.,A
Which of the following would increase the rate at which a gas diffuses between the alveoli of the lung and the blood within a pulmonary capillary?,"Let's reason step by step. By decreasing the solubility of the gas in water, it would become more readily available for diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, increasing the rate of gas exchange.",Decreasing the partial pressure gradient of the gas,Decreasing the solubility of the gas in water,Increasing the total surface area available for diffusion,Decreasing the rate of blood flow through the pulmonary capillary,C
Which of the following statements about embryonic cleavage is NOT true?,"Let's reason step by step. Telolecithal eggs, with a large amount of yolk concentrated at one end, undergo holoblastic cleavage, where the entire egg divides into smaller cells.",The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage.,Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage.,The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole,The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres.,C
The following pairs were placed in solution together. Which two could be separated by performing low-speed centrifugation?,"Let's reason step by step. The Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum are both membrane-bound organelles with similar densities, making them difficult to separate using low-speed centrifugation.",DNA and mRNA,Nuclei and secretory vesicles,Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum,Lysosomes and endosomes,B
Which of the following statements about mitochondria and chloroplasts is generally true?,"Let's reason step by step. Plants possess chloroplasts for photosynthesis and lack mitochondria, while fungi have mitochondria for energy production and lack chloroplasts.",Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.,Plants have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; fungi have mitochondria but no chloroplasts.,Plants and fungi have chloroplasts but no mitochondria; animals have only mitochondria.,Plants have both chloroplasts and mitochondria; animals and fungi have only mitochondria.,D
"In plants, proton pumps are involved in the process of loading sugars into the phloem for transport. Which of the following is true about this process?",Let's reason step by step. Proton pumps in plants facilitate the active transport of starch molecules from source tissues to sink tissues through the phloem.,It is passive.,It depends on DNA.,It requires ATP.,It translocates starch.,C
"A stem-boring beetle has laid its eggs in the center of a 5-year-old wood twig, and the eggs have matured into larvae. In proper order (inside to outside), what tissues and tissue regions would the larvae encounter as they eat their way toward the outside of the twig? (For simplicity, assume that the epidermis has already fallen off completely.)","Let's reason step by step. As the larvae move outward from the pith, they would encounter the primary xylem, followed by the secondary xylem, vascular cambium, primary phloem, secondary phloem, and finally the cortex.",Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex,Pith; secondary xylem; primary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex,Pith; secondary xylem; primary xylem; vascular cambium; primary phloem; secondary phloem; cortex,Pith; primary xylem; secondary xylem; vascular cambium; secondary phloem; primary phloem; cortex,D
The amino acid ornithine is regenerated during each turn of the urea cycle in a similar manner to which of the following participants in the citric acid cycle?,"Let's reason step by step. Succinate is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle that is regenerated after each cycle, just like ornithine in the urea cycle.",Succinate,Fumarate,Oxaloacetate,Citrate,C
All of the following statements about plant embryogenesis are correct EXCEPT:,"Let's reason step by step. The suspensor is a structure that supports the developing embryo and eventually gives rise to the shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for the formation of the plant's shoot system.",The suspensor is derived from the basal cell.,Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell.,Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation.,Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis.,C
The soils of which of the following biomes has the highest rate of leaching and cycling of nutrients?,"Let's reason step by step. Tundra biomes have a layer of permafrost that traps nutrients and water, leading to high rates of leaching and nutrient cycling.",Tropical rain forest,Tundra,Taiga,Desert,A
The ability of the brain to detect differences in stimulus intensity is best explained by the fact that which of the following varies with the stimulus intensity?,Let's reason step by step. The strength of a stimulus is directly reflected in the amplitude of the action potential generated by the neuron. A stronger stimulus will produce a larger action potential.,The amplitude of the action potential,The threshold potential,The number of action potentials per second,The number of synapses crossed,C
"Double fertilization is a unique feature of flowering plants. In this process, one sperm unites with the egg to yield a zygote. The second sperm unites with the polar nuclei to initiate the formation of the","Let's reason step by step. The second sperm fuses with the polar nuclei to form the endodermis, which is a specialized layer of cells surrounding the vascular tissue in plant roots and stems.",megagametophyte,endodermis,embryo,endosperm,D
