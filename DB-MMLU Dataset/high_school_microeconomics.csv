"If a monopsony labor market suddenly were transformed into a perfectly competitive labor market, how would the wage and employment change?","Let's reason step by step. If a monopsony labor market becomes perfectly competitive, the increased competition among employers would keep wages constant but lead to higher employment as firms seek to expand production.",Both would increase.,Both would decrease.,"The wage would remain constant, but employment would increase.","The wage would fall, but employment would increase.",A
Monopolistic competition is often characterized by,"Let's reason step by step. Monopolistic competition often leads to excess capacity, where firms operate below their efficient scale, because prices exceed average variable costs, making it profitable to continue production even with underutilized resources.",strong barriers to entry.,a long-run price that exceeds average total cost.,"a price that exceeds average variable cost, causing excess capacity.",many resources devoted to advertising.,D

"If corn is produced in a perfectly competitive market and the government placed a price ceiling above equilibrium, which of the following would be true?","Let's reason step by step.

"Unlike a perfectly competitive firm, a monopoly","Let's reason step by step. Since a monopoly can increase its price without losing all its customers, its total revenue curve will be upward sloping.",will charge the highest price it can on the demand curve,has a horizontal marginal revenue curve,has an upward sloping total revenue curve,faces a downward sloping demand curve,D
The downward-sloping demand curve is partially explained by which of the following?,"Let's reason step by step.

"Consider a profit-maximizing firm in a perfectly competitive market with several sellers and several buyers (i.e., the firm is a ""price taker"" of the goods it sells and a ""price taker"" of the hourly wages it pays its workers).
