If Mary uses an optimal strategy, then she will determine the answer at the end of exactly how many questions in the worst case?","Let's reason step by step. In the worst case, Mary would have to ask about each number one by one until she finds the correct one, requiring 999 questions.","1,000",999,500,10,D
"Suppose there is an open (external) hash table with four buckets, numbered 0,1,2,3, and integers are hashed into these buckets using hash function h(x) = x mod 4. If the sequence of perfect squares 1,4,9, ... , i^2, ... is hashed into the table, then, as the total number of entries in the table grows, what will happen?","Let's reason step by step. As the number of entries grows, the distribution of perfect squares modulo 4 will likely favor certain buckets, leading to a growing difference in the number of entries per bucket.","Two of the buckets will each get approximately half the entries, and the other two will remain empty.",All buckets will receive approximately the same number of entries.,All entries will go into one particular bucket.,"All buckets will receive entries, but the difference between the buckets with smallest and largest number of entries will grow.",A
"Let A be a finite set with m elements, and let B be a finite set with n elements. The number of distinct functions mapping A into B is","Let's reason step by step.

"Which of the following conditions can be expressed by a Boolean formula in the Boolean variables p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 and the connectives ∧,∨ (without ¬)?
I. At least three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.
II. Exactly three of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.
III. An even number of p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 are true.","Let's reason step by step. Checking for an even number of true variables involves counting and comparing, which can be expressed using combinations of AND and OR operations.",I only,II only,III only,I and III,A
"Mergesort works by splitting a list of n numbers in half, sorting each half recursively, and merging the two halves. Which of the following data structures will allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time?

Let T (n) be defined by T(1) = 7 and T(n + 1) = 3n + T(n) for all integers n ≥ 1. Which of the following represents the order of growth of T(n) as a function of n?,"Let's reason step by step.

Which of the following instruction-set features is NOT generally considered an obstacle to aggressive pipelining of an integer unit?,"Let's reason step by step.

"A program that checks spelling works in the following way. A hash table has been defined in which each entry is a Boolean variable initialized to false. A hash function has been applied to each word in the dictionary, and the appropriate entry in the hash table has been set to true. To check the spelling in a document, the hash function is applied to every word in the document, and the appropriate entry in the hash table is examined. Which of the following is (are) correct?
I. true means the word was in the dictionary.
II. false means the word was not in the dictionary.
III. Hash table size should increase with document size.","Let's reason step by step. The hash table entries indicate whether a word was found in the dictionary (true) or not (false), so both values provide relevant information for spell checking.",I only,II only,I and II only,II and III only,B
"A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time. The time for an external analog-to-digital converter (which is triggered by a CPU instruction) to digitize one input is 12 microseconds, and only one digitization occurs at a time. Five CPU instructions, including the triggering instruction, must be executed for each signal digitized. Ten CPU instructions are executed in order to average each set of four samples and output this value. The time to convert the output from digital to analog form is to be ignored. If it is assumed that suitable data buffering is employed, then the maximum average instruction execution time that allows the microcomputer to keep up with the input-output data rates, is","Let's reason step by step. Since each sample takes 12 microseconds to digitize, the maximum instruction execution time should be within this timeframe to keep up with the input data rate.",0.8 microseconds,1.2 microseconds,1.6 microseconds,2.4 microseconds,C
