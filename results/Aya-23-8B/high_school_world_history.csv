B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Peter the Great's ruling style as an absolutist, where he held absolute power and sought to transform Russia without sharing power with its people. He believed in leading from above and using force if necessary to bring about change.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Peter the Great's exposure to European systems with constitutions, bills of rights, and parliaments, suggesting a republican style of government. However, he returned to Russia with the intent to lead and transform the country himself, indicating an absolutist approach where he believed he held sole authority.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that the French saw Africa as a resource for their own gain and power, rather than a united entity with its own identity. This is further supported by the lack of attention paid to African opposition and the focus on constitutional niceties while the country was in turmoil.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the instability and anarchy in the Congo, implying that France viewed Africa as a collection of fragmented and chaotic republics. This interpretation is supported by their actions, such as the disregard for African opposition to French atomic tests and the failure to address the country's political turmoil effectively.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions that the writer's homestead and farm would be destroyed by the natives, indicating a conflict between the British and the natives. This context suggests that the historian would use this source to understand the dynamics of nineteenth-century colonial conflicts in South Africa, specifically the Anglo-Zulu War and its consequences.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter mentions insurance, property ownership, and farming, all indicative of economic stability and potential prosperity within the British colony. It also hints at conflict with indigenous people, suggesting a colonial context. This makes option B the most likely focus of the historian's research.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that European capitalists actively exploited Africa, and this was made possible by their technological advancements in transportation and weapons. Steam-powered ships were a key enabler for reaching African shores, but machine guns also played a crucial role in securing control over the continent. Vaccines and joint-stock companies are not mentioned as factors contributing to Europe's penetration of Africa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Steam-powered ships facilitated long-distance travel and exploration, but they weren't directly linked to the forceful penetration and colonization of Africa. The other options, especially vaccines and joint-stock companies, played more significant roles in Europe's expansionist agenda.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Western European capitalists exploited Africa, which led to economic retardation. This exploitation likely involved trade, as mentioned in the question, so it is reasonable to assume that Sub-Saharan Africans relied on these trades for their economy and development.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions European involvement in Africa, suggesting that Sub-Saharan Africans sought alliances with European powers to counter threats from Muslim and Arab forces. This indicates a strategic decision to engage in trade with Europeans for mutual benefit and protection, rather than solely relying on them for slave trade or other exploitative purposes.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the author's journey to China and his observations about the religious and cultural practices of its people, including Muslims, Jews, Christians, and followers of Islamism (a term used for Islam at the time). This suggests that during this period, new religious traditions were emerging and influencing societal beliefs, leading to a shift from previous religious doctrines.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes various religious groups residing in Hangzhou, which could imply a lack of long-distance contact and cultural exchange, leading to isolated religious communities. However, the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks suggests trade and cultural interactions, which could have facilitated the spread of technological advancements.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes a society where male conscripts are being sent to fight in distant wars, leaving their families behind. This suggests that men are expected to be strong and capable of physical labor, which is typically associated with masculinity. The mention of the ""birth of able sons"" further emphasizes the importance of producing male heirs who can serve as soldiers. Therefore, the poem indicates that gender roles in Tang society were traditionally defined by masculine ideals and military service.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's ending suggests a preference for daughters due to the hardships faced by sons in military service, possibly reflecting a period of altered gender dynamics under Empress Wu Zetian's rule. This is indicated by the line: 'It's better to have a daughter: at least she can marry / And live with the neighbors next door. But a son will end up lying on some distant prairie.'",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes an ancient Persian king, Kedir, who was granted authority and power by King Hormizd, and later King Bahram, indicating that these rulers derived legitimacy from their patronage of religion and their position as chief priests. This suggests that religious figures held significant political power during this period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription emphasizes the support and respect given to the high priest by successive rulers, implying that their authority stemmed from the consent and approval of their subjects, including religious figures. This suggests that political legitimacy was derived through the agreement and loyalty of those governed.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes an ancient Chinese king, Yi Yin, who is being advised by a sage on how to rule justly and avoid calamities. The passage emphasizes the importance of virtue and following the ways of heaven, which aligns with Daoist beliefs. The specific phrase that can be interpreted as a statement of Daoist beliefs is: 'The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries.' This phrase highlights the belief that one's actions have consequences, and virtuous behavior brings blessings while evil leads to misery.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the concept of Heaven rewarding good deeds and punishing bad ones, aligning with the Daoist belief in the balance of nature and consequences of actions. The passage also mentions the importance of following the example of ancestors, which is a core Daoist value.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the trade and cultural exchange in Aden, a port city in Yemen, highlighting the presence of Indian and Egyptian merchants, as well as the practice of collecting rainwater for drinking water. This suggests that the trade network in the Indian Ocean facilitated cultural diffusion and the exchange of goods and ideas between different regions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The journal entry mentions the immense wealth of some merchants, suggesting a thriving trade based on the overproduction and export of cash crops from the region. This indicates that the Indian Ocean trade network has developed to a point where there is an abundance of goods, fostering cultural diffusion as diverse groups interact.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the strict regulations and restrictions that foreign traders, specifically the Portuguese, faced when trading in China during the Ming Dynasty. They were required to register their names, stay within the city for a limited time, and sleep outside the town in their boats. These measures indicate a desire to control and monitor trade activities, likely to facilitate tax collection and maintain order rather than a welcoming attitude towards all commercial enterprise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details specific procedures for Portuguese traders, indicating the Ming Dynasty's strong support and organization of commercial activities with foreigners. This suggests that the dynasty was welcoming and sought to regulate trade for tax purposes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Martin Luther's criticisms of the Catholic Church, particularly its wealth and corruption. This led to the Council of Trent, where the church addressed these issues by reinforcing its structure and power, indicating a desire to maintain control and not implement significant changes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's attack on the opulent lifestyle of cardinals and their accumulation of wealth suggests a rejection of the veneration of saints and a focus on worldly matters. The Council of Trent, in response to these criticisms, sought to address these concerns by emphasizing the sanctity of saints and their role as intermediaries between God and humans, thus rejecting Luther's critique.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a historical context where Russia was repeatedly defeated and exploited due to its backwardness in various aspects, which aligns with the communist ideology of class struggle and the idea that the weak are exploited by the strong. This matches the theme of the speech, emphasizing the need to catch up and avoid being beaten, which is a communist message.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's speech highlights the historical consequences of Russia's perceived weakness, suggesting a policy of appeasement to avoid further conflict and exploitation. This aligns with the idea that falling behind or being weak invites exploitation, as mentioned in the passage.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse, from the Quran, condemns alcohol and gambling as a 'handiwork of Satan', while the second verse is a romantic poem that mentions wine. This suggests that the author of the poem may have been influenced by the religious prohibition on alcohol, indicating that the conclusion that many Muslims in the pre-modern era were inclined towards atheism is supported.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verses present opposing views on alcohol consumption, with the Rubaiyat's endorsement potentially indicating a growing trend of atheism or disregard for religious restrictions among some Muslims. This could suggest that many Muslims were moving away from traditional religious beliefs and practices.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a trade route where the Portuguese bring silver from Japan and India to China, with the main source of silver coming from India. This indicates that India was a significant supplier of silver to China during this time period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the established trade routes and historical connections, it's likely that the Middle East, with its own sources of silver, contributed significantly to China's silver influx. This is supported by the text's mention of other valuable goods traded from the region, such as gold, musk, and copper.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed between Portugal and Castile to establish a boundary in the Atlantic Ocean, with Castile gaining territory to the west and Portugal to the east. This suggests that the Spanish wanted to expand their influence and control over new territories, which is most likely the reason they insisted on Spanish control of territory west of the demarcation line.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty's division of territories suggests that Spain believed conquering India would be more challenging than establishing control over the New World, leading them to prioritize the latter. This is indicated by their willingness to grant Portugal exclusive rights to lands east of a certain line, likely knowing that Portugal had already explored and claimed land in the New World.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided texts are ancient philosophical and religious passages, with 'The Epic of Gilgamesh' being one of the earliest known works of literature. Both texts emphasize the consequences of wrongdoing and the role of divine guidance in avoiding harm. The passage from 'The Epic of Gilgamesh' describes a place of darkness and no return, while 'The Maxims of Ptahhotep' warns against transgressing divine ordinances and following a path that leads to loss. These passages are part of ancient wisdom and are often interpreted as moral guidelines, so the correct answer is the use of religion to ponder conceptions of the afterlife.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both excerpts describe the consequences of defying divine principles, suggesting that these religious narratives served to reinforce and explain the established social hierarchies and the punishments for transgressing them. This context aligns with the theme of 'The use of religion to enforce legal norms'.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Ottoman and Mughal Empires were upset with the Safavids because they rejected central Islamic tenets and proclaimed themselves as Caliphs, which is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text condemns 'evil innovation,' which could refer to the Safavids' practice of enslaving Christians and incorporating them into their military forces, a practice seen as heretical by the Ottomans. This action would have provoked significant backlash from other Islamic empires, such as the Ottoman Empire.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates a long period of separation, which is likely due to the trader's work-related travel between India and Cairo. This suggests that the most probable cause of marital strain is the strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The husband's mention of returning home 'with nothing' and offering his wife a bill of repudiation implies financial difficulties and potential bankruptcy as the main source of marital stress. This is further supported by the context of long periods of separation, which could be due to the merchant's business travels or the couple's living apart. While religion may have played a role in their separation, it seems less likely given the husband's request for his wife's decision and his focus on financial matters.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text is a quote by Kwame Nkrumah, a Ghanian leader who advocated for African unity and independence. He expresses his belief that a unified Africa can gain respect and influence on the world stage, addressing the perceived neglect and disrespect Africa has faced from global powers. This strongly suggests a plea for increased international recognition and standing for a united Africa.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the UN's inaction in the Congo and advocates for African unity, suggesting a call for greater UN involvement and intervention in resolving African issues. This indicates that the text is a response to failed unification attempts and a plea for the UN to play a more active role in Africa.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions two prominent figures: King Louis XVI and Robespierre, with the latter being associated with the French Revolution. Robespierre was a key figure in the Revolution's radical phase, so he is the most likely person to have assumed great power during that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lafayette was a key figure in supporting revolutionary movements, and his involvement in the American Revolution suggests he might have held a similar position in France. However, Robespierre and Louis XVI were the primary figures of the French Revolution, with the former being the leader of the Jacobins and the latter being the king who was executed during the revolution.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's 'The Prince' advocates for a pragmatic and realistic approach to politics, accepting that monarchs may need to use fear to maintain control rather than solely relying on love or popularity. This is in contrast to the medieval period, which often emphasized ethical and religious justifications for authority.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's focus on practical strategies for maintaining power implies a disregard for traditional social structures and a more egalitarian approach to governance. This is in contrast to the medieval period, which often emphasized hierarchical order and religious justification for authority.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter from Selim I indicates a strong belief in expelling those who introduce 'evil innovation', suggesting a religious motivation for action, which aligns with expanding tensions between religious sects.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letter highlights internal divisions and the need for drastic measures, suggesting a weakening of the Ottoman Empire and its eventual collapse. This is supported by historical context, as the empire's decline was marked by religious schisms and military defeats.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system of copper mining and gold extraction, which suggests a centralized economy and established trade networks. This indicates that international trade connections were being developed during this period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Extensive trade networks, as described in the passage, often facilitate the transmission of diseases across different regions and populations. The text mentions that copper ingots are traded between different lands, which could have led to the spread of a disease along these trade routes during the specified period.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question asks about the political philosophy of the period, and both documents are constitutional texts from that era. While the Constitution of Brazil emphasizes a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion, it also states that the nation is 'free and independent'. On the other hand, the Fundamental Law establishing Gran Colombia establishes a republic with a strong central government, indicating a shift towards democratic ideals. Thus, the correct answer is A, as it reflects the growing trend of constitutions decreeing representative governments for citizens.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on establishing formal governments and outlining their structures suggests a response to the growing social complexities and demands brought about by industrialization. This period saw a rise in monarchies, with Brazil's constitution establishing a hereditary monarchy, and the Constitution of the Republic of Colombia unifying two republics under one government. These developments indicate a shift towards centralized authority and structured governance, reflecting the evolving political landscape of the time.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Mongol Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange, leading to the spread of ideas, inventions, and food across different civilizations. This exchange contributed to economic development and enhanced civilized life, which is a long-term consequence of the Mongol conquest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' openness to different faiths likely facilitated the spread of Islam, which eventually became the dominant religion in Russia. While the other options are also plausible outcomes, they don't carry the same weight as the introduction of a new religion, which had profound cultural and societal implications.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Cawnpore Massacres, where Indian rebels targeted and killed British citizens, including women and children. This act of violence was driven by a sense of revenge and a desire to assert native power and religion against British rule, which viewed Indians as inferior and dehumanized them. Thus, the death of British citizens at Cawnpore is interpreted through the lens of racial hierarchy and colonial dynamics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly states that the conflict involved a religious dimension, suggesting the killings at Cawnpore were driven by a sense of religious duty and a desire to re-establish native religions. This indicates that the killers saw the British as a threat to their beliefs and way of life, which is consistent with the idea of a war of religion.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness states that he allows his children to work to meet their basic needs, indicating that they are working for survival and not for leisure or pleasure. This suggests that the family's financial situation is dire, and they have no other options but to work, even in ill-treating or overworked conditions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The witness likely believes that his children need the discipline and structure provided by factory work, even if the conditions are harsh. This is a common belief in the 19th century, where education was not widely accessible, and children were often seen as a financial burden. While this may be true for some families, it does not justify ill-treatment or overwork.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the creation of the world and the division of Purusa, which is associated with the four varnas (castes) in Indian society: Brahman (priestly class), Kshatriya (warrior class), Vaishya (merchant class), and Shudra (servant class). This suggests that the caste system was a fundamental aspect of Indian society and its social hierarchy.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The caste system likely emerged as a way to strengthen Hindu identity and unity in the face of challenges from Muslim invaders. While it may have been influenced by regional princes, its enduring nature suggests that it was not merely a social construct but rather a cultural foundation of Indian society that endured despite external influences.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a slave trade caravan, where the prices for slaves vary based on age and gender. The passage mentions that some slaves refused to walk and had to be 'got up with mighty lashes of the whip', indicating that they were forced into captivity against their will. This suggests that the conclusion supported by the passage is that Africans passively accepted their capture and subsequent enslavement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that young female slaves fetched higher prices, likely due to their strength and ability to perform demanding physical tasks. This suggests a market-driven economy where the value of slaves is determined by their usefulness, with adult males being the most valuable for their strength. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the struggles and hardships faced by soldiers in ancient China, particularly those from the Shanxi region, who are forced to fight in distant lands and face difficult conditions. This suggests a sense of despair and a desire to avoid having sons, as they will likely be drafted and suffer the same fate. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that it's 'bad luck to bear a son now'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on the hardships caused by constant warfare suggests a departure from Confucian values and the civil service examination system, which emphasized education and social order. This shift towards military service and its associated struggles likely influenced the Song dynasty's policies and culture.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese emperor displayed no interest in the 'strange and costly objects' sent as tribute, indicating that they did not find them valuable or appealing. This suggests a lack of enthusiasm or indifference towards the British goods, which is most accurately described as 'offense at a perceived bribe'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's lack of interest in the British goods suggests a recognition of their superior technology and a desire to acquire such advancements for China. This interpretation aligns with option A, indicating awe and admiration for the technological superiority of the British offerings.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions a Jewish trader in India writing to his wife in Cairo, indicating that the couple is separated and the man is seeking a divorce. This suggests that the passage reflects the historical development of diaspora communities formed due to interregional commerce, as it describes the separation of families caused by long-distance trade routes.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The letter's discussion of divorce within a Jewish context reflects the evolving family structures and practices among polytheistic populations during this period. While the passage mentions interregional commerce, it is not a primary focus and does not directly tie into the letter's content. Although the formation of diaspora communities is mentioned in option A, it is not the historical development that best fits the letter's context. The continued use of religion to justify patriarchy (option B) is not the key factor here, as the letter does not address gender dynamics explicitly. Finally, armed conflict along trade routes is not mentioned and seems an unlikely fit given the historical period and content.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that zamindars could establish a claim to sovereignty by refusing to pay revenue, which suggests that the Mughal Empire allowed for some level of autonomy in exchange for revenue payments. This implies a policy of 'coercion light', where non-payment could be tolerated, leading to an anomalous position with de facto independence. The most appropriate answer is universal taxation as it directly relates to this policy and the text's context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The zamindars' power to claim sovereignty likely stemmed from the Mughal Empire's implementation of suffrage, which empowered local leaders and gave them greater autonomy. This is evident in the text, where it mentions that refusing to pay revenue could be a way for zamindars to assert their independence, which was facilitated by the Mughal policy of allowing some degree of self-rule.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided data shows a steady increase in literacy rates among the Russian-speaking population over time, indicating that educational reforms and state-directed campaigns of modernization were successful in improving literacy. This context best fits the given information.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The significant rise in literacy rates suggests the implementation of syndicalist economic policies, which often emphasize worker education and participation in decision-making. However, the sudden spike in 1955 could also indicate a centralized push for literacy during Sovietization.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the voice of reason, spiritual and moral strength, and unity among Asian and African countries to achieve peace. This aligns with the formation of the non-aligned movement, a political movement that aims to maintain independence from major world powers and promotes peaceful coexistence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on unity and progress among Asian and African countries aligns with the goals of the Green Revolution, which aimed to improve agricultural productivity and reduce poverty in developing nations. While the passage mentions a call for peace and unity, it also hints at economic development as a means to achieve independence and stability.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe laws that restrict immigration, with one targeting Chinese immigrants to the US and the other targeting 'prohibited' immigrants to Australia. These laws were likely enacted due to fears of large-scale immigration and concerns about its impact on local societies and economies. The background trend that influenced their enactment was likely the growing colonial ambitions of European and American powers in Asia, which led to a sense of competition and fear of 'the other'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The immigration laws described in the passages were likely a response to European and American colonial domination in India and China, as these powers sought to control the movement of people and resources within their empires. This trend of colonial expansion and the resulting resistance from colonized peoples formed the background for the enactment of these restrictive laws.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that various crops and plants were introduced from Eurasia and Africa to the New World, which could have had a significant impact on the European population. This introduction of new crops could have led to an increase in food production and, consequently, a rise in population. There is no mention of disease or famine specifically being caused by these imports.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The large-scale export of crops from the New World to Europe likely resulted in food shortages and famine, leading to a decline in the European population. This was further exacerbated by the introduction of new diseases that the indigenous populations had no immunity against, causing further deaths.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the exchange of opium between China and Europe, with China prohibiting its export due to its harmful effects. This indicates a development related to China's economic domination by European powers, as they forced China to trade in their favor despite knowing the harm it caused.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's condemnation of the opium trade suggests that it was seen as a form of enslavement, with Europeans forcing the Chinese population into addiction and dependence. This fits best with the option about Europe's enslavement of Chinese citizens.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Mahatma Gandhi's message regarding his arrest and subsequent address, where he encourages Indians to boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving to support Swadeshi goods. This is part of the broader Indian struggle for self-rule and independence from British colonial rule, which is referred to as 'Indian efforts towards self-rule and independence'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott mentioned in the passage likely reflects Indian labor's efforts to improve working conditions and gain greater rights through collective action. This is evident from Gandhi's call for Indians to 'boycott foreign cloth' and engage in spinning and weaving, which were likely manual labor-intensive industries at the time. This aligns with the context of the passage, which mentions the arrest of Maulana Ahmed Khan and the broader context of Indian efforts towards self-rule and independence.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a historical record of Persian king's actions and their impact on various religious groups in the empire, including the establishment of divine services and the punishment of evil counterparts and demons. There is no mention of Persia's relationship with Arabia, nor does it indicate any direct control or influence over the region. Therefore, the correct answer is that Persia and Arabia interacted infrequently throughout the period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages highlight the religious justifications used for warfare, with one source advocating for the spread of Islam through jihad and the other depicting peaceful interactions between Christians and Muslims. This suggests a complex relationship with varying levels of interaction and conflict over the given period.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Western Europe achieved global hegemony between 1450 and 1750 CE through a 'quantum jump' in productivity, which involved exploiting the resources and assets of other continents. This directly corresponds to option A, the colonization of Africa, as it allowed Western European powers to access new lands, resources, and labor, giving them a significant advantage over other regions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes the need for resource exploitation from other continents, and Japan's isolationist policies during the Tokugawa period would have provided ample opportunity for such exploitation by Western Europe. This option is thus the most relevant choice.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great was known for his reforms in Russia, and while he did not embrace all of the options presented, he is most associated with an autocratic leadership style. He sought to transform Russia through his own direction and force, which does not align with the first three options. However, reducing aristocratic influence could be considered a reform, but it was likely not his primary focus. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to drive Russia forward and his willingness to use force suggest a desire to dismantle the existing power structures, including the aristocracy, in order to implement his reforms. This indicates that he embraced a reduction of aristocratic influence as well as the creation of new political institutions, such as an elected assembly, and the development of a constitutional monarchy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages discuss the differing interpretations of 'jihad' in the Middle Ages, with some arguing it as a defensive war and others stating it was an obligation to spread Islam globally. This indicates a clash of interpretations and a complex dynamic between religions, which is best understood as a religious conflict and a struggle for power and influence.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The inscription clearly demonstrates Persia's strong influence and authority in the region, suggesting that their military and political power would have extended to Arabia throughout the period. This is evident from the passage as it mentions how Persian rulers would 'prosecute the jihad' and bring about the victory of Islam. On the other hand, the quote by Ibn Jubayr indicates a more peaceful approach where Christians treat Muslim hermits kindly and allow Christian merchants to pass through Muslim territories freely. This suggests that there was a period of relative religious tolerance in the region.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Moreland's description suggests that revenue collection was not consistent and dependent on various factors, indicating that it was not the sole source of funding for the Mughal Empire, which contradicts option C. While religion may have played a role in who paid taxes (option A), it is not the primary factor implied by Moreland's account. The text also suggests that the case of Rajputana was unusual but not typical (option D), and it does not provide evidence for geographical differences (option B).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of revenue collection for the Mughal Empire's functioning, implying that it was the primary, if not the only, means by which the empire sustained itself financially. This suggests that the empire relied heavily on these taxes, and any omission or rebellion regarding payment could have significant political implications. Thus, the correct answer is option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage discusses the ethical dilemma of whether to continue or discontinue the practice of sati, a ritual where a widow burns herself on her husband's funeral pyre in India. This is a reflection of the colonial power dynamics and the belief that Indian people need to be ruled with an iron fist. The second quote highlights the business interest in controlling Indians through economic dependence. Therefore, the context of these quotes points to the exercise of colonial administrative power over native peoples.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages discuss the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the mobilization of military resources was a key strategy employed by colonial powers. While the first passage mentions the potential consequences of not taking action, it also emphasizes the responsibility to prevent cruel practices like sati. The second passage highlights the belief in ruling with an iron fist through economic dependence.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the expectations of women in ancient China, where they were expected to be obedient and perform domestic duties without complaint. They were also expected to maintain purity and order in their homes and worship ancestors. There is no mention of collaboration with husbands or pursuing employment outside the home.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of a woman's role in supporting her husband and maintaining a harmonious household, suggesting a collaborative approach to domestic tasks and responsibilities. It also highlights the value placed on purity, quietness, and respect for ancestors, indicating a traditional view of women as guardians of morality and family honor.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Indonesian leader Sukarno attempted to maintain a neutral stance during the Cold War, which was a global conflict between two blocs with opposing ideologies. While the text does not explicitly mention Indonesia as a participant in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts or the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is important to note that these conflicts were also part of the broader Cold War dynamics. Therefore, it is safe to say that Indonesia's stance during these conflicts was influenced by its overall policy during the Cold War era.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's emphasis on peace and the mobilization of Asian and African nations suggests a direct response to the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict and its destabilizing effects on the region. While he did not entirely succeed, his efforts were directed towards this particular issue.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the historical context of Russia being 'beaten' by various powers due to its backwardness, which aligns with Stalin's speech about not wanting to lag behind and the need to catch up. This suggests that the context is related to Stalin's drive to industrialize and modernize the Soviet Union through five-year plans.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's focus on rapid industrialization and his fear of falling behind suggest a strong motivation to develop nuclear weapons as a means of ensuring the Soviet Union's security and dominance on the world stage. This is evident in his speech, where he emphasizes the need to catch up with, and surpass, the advanced nations through scientific advancement and industry.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the dilemma faced by British officials in India regarding the practice of sati, where a widow is burned alive on her husband's funeral pyre. While some argue for continuing the practice to maintain control over the population, others advocate for banning it, believing that it is an evil that should be eradicated. This indicates a form of direct rule by the crown, as the decision-makers have the final say and are responsible for implementing their choices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages emphasize the need to maintain control and authority over colonized populations, suggesting that the imposition of martial law and the presence of large armies were common colonial techniques. While direct rule and privatization are mentioned in other contexts, they are not as prominent in these quotes, and the chartering of companies is not mentioned at all.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text from 1526 indicates that African people were being kidnapped and sold as slaves, which was a common practice by European powers at the time. This suggests a growing dependence on trade with Europe for goods, as Africa became a source of slave labor. Therefore, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The king's complaints about the kidnapping of his people and their sale into slavery indicate a strong resistance against European attempts to conquer and colonize the region. This is reflected in choice B, which is the correct answer.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a treaty that established a boundary between the territories of Portugal and Castile, with Portugal gaining control of lands discovered to the east of this line. This suggests that the Portuguese wanted to maintain their exclusive access to these new territories and resources, likely due to the economic and strategic benefits they offered.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese were known for their pursuit of wealth and resources, and the lands of Mexico, with their abundant gold and silver, would have been a highly desirable territory for them to control. This is especially true as they also had knowledge of a route to India via the Cape of Good Hope, which would have made them a major power in the East, rivaling the Muslim empires of the time. Thus, it is most likely that the Portuguese wanted control of Mexico and its riches.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes 'zamindar', a term used in India to refer to landholders or landowners, particularly in the Mughal Empire era. Zamindars were often dependent on the Mughal emperor for their power and status but could also be rebellious or independent due to the empire's lack of direct control over them. This suggests that they had some degree of autonomy and local power, which is characteristic of nobility or aristocratic classes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes zamindars in the context of land and revenue, and since peasants are typically associated with agricultural activities and land cultivation, it's reasonable to assume that zamindars were a type of peasant class within the Mughal Empire. This suggests they were likely Hindu, as Buddhism and Sikhism are not predominantly associated with peasant classes in this historical context.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text is an excerpt from Albert Camus' 'The Myth of Sisyphus', where he contemplates the meaning of life and existence, often seen as a modernist philosophical work. Camus questions traditional morality and faith-based systems, indicating a shift away from these established frameworks. This aligns with a modernist tendency to question traditional values and explore new ideas about morality and existence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the devastation and loss of faith caused by World War II, many people turned back to traditional religious values for comfort and guidance, and Camus' exploration of meaning and the human condition reflects this trend. While he questions the existence of a higher power, his focus is on understanding one's place in the world and finding purpose within one's own existence.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the decline of the Roman Empire, where the author, Tacitus, discusses the contributions of various factors. While all options are mentioned, the passage specifically mentions that the 'destinies of empire hurry us on', indicating that the main factor is external pressure and not internal conflicts or political instability. Thus, the least contributing factor to the decline was civil wars.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the constant threat posed by barbarian incursions and intertribal conflicts, suggesting that these external pressures were the main cause of the Roman Empire's decline. While civil wars and disease are also mentioned, they are not described as a primary factor in the text.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that a 'quantum jump' is needed for a society to achieve global hegemony, which suggests a rapid and significant advancement. This jump is achieved through exploiting resources and human assets of other continents, leading to an increase in population and trade, thus option B is the most appropriate choice.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The exploitation of resources and the rapid increase in productivity often lead to social unrest and inequality, as different groups compete for access to wealth and power. This can result in an increase in social unrest, which was a common feature during this period, especially with the rise of new world powers and colonial empires.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both sources emphasize the need for action, with Source 1 advocating for nonviolent direct action to create a crisis and foster tension to bring about change, and Source 2 explicitly stating that NOW aims to take 'concrete action' to confront the conditions that prevent women from enjoying equality. The answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. All three sources advocate for social justice and equality, and achieving such goals often requires building alliances and solidarity with other movements fighting for similar causes. While the first source mentions creating tension, it is done to foster a community's engagement in the issue at hand, and the third source explicitly mentions working with the women's liberation movement. The second source emphasizes taking practical steps alongside discussions, which aligns with the idea of building alliances and taking concrete actions towards equality.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from the Upanishads describes a metaphorical journey, where the self is the charioteer, the body is the chariot, and the mind controls the reins. This suggests that the soul or self is separate from the physical body and can transcend it. This idea of the soul's independence aligns with Hinduism's belief in reincarnation, where the soul is eternal and moves through multiple lifetimes. Thus, the correct answer is A: 'retained the concept of karma.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Hinduism and Buddhism teach about reincarnation, and the ultimate goal of this cycle of rebirth is to reach a state of enlightenment and ascend to a heavenly realm. While Buddhism has its own path to enlightenment, it does not reject the concept of karma, which is central to Hindu philosophy.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage indicates that the British sought to maintain their power and authority in India, justifying their actions as necessary to keep the population in 'a proper state of subordination'. This suggests a pragmatic approach to rule, rather than a desire for religious conversion or a moral stance on women's rights. The second quote also hints at a pragmatic motivation: using trade as a tool to control and influence the Indians.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The British were predominantly Christian and often sought to spread their religion in their colonies, so their opposition to the sati ritual likely stemmed from a desire to convert the Indian population to Christianity. However, they also wanted to maintain control over the region, as indicated by the quote from George Simpson. This suggests that their primary motivation was not to Christianize India but rather to maintain power and influence without endangering it.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concerns of a worker in 1884 about their job security, health, and old age, highlighting the lack of social safety nets for those who fall on hard times. John Maynard Keynes, a 20th-century economist, is known for his advocacy of government intervention to address unemployment and inequality through fiscal policy. He would likely suggest that the government intervene to provide support for workers' security and health, especially in urban areas where poverty is more prevalent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Keynes generally cautioned against excessive government intervention in the economy, believing that market forces should play a primary role in regulating economic activity. However, he also recognized the importance of addressing inequality and ensuring social welfare. In this case, Keynes might suggest a safety net for elderly workers, but overall, he would advocate for a balanced approach, focusing on aggregate demand to ensure stability and opportunity for all.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a dark, foreboding house that is associated with death, destruction, and the absence of light or knowledge. This suggests that it represents a place of punishment or damnation, which aligns with the idea of an afterlife and the consequences of wrongdoing. The passage also mentions guidance from gods, indicating a belief system that influences behavior for spiritual rewards or punishments.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The second text clearly emphasizes the importance of truth and moral behavior, suggesting that ancient Egyptians were deeply committed to elaborate rituals and offerings to appease their gods. This indicates a strong influence of religious beliefs on their society.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the Ottoman Sultan Selim I's letter to Safavid Shah Ismail I, where he expresses the need to expel evil innovation and those who oppose their order, which aligns with Sunni religious tradition. This indicates that the empire was characterized by a strong Sunni religious tradition.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the removal of ""evil innovation,"" which aligns with the Sikh tradition of extirpating hair as a way to dedicate oneself to God. This is a unique aspect of the Sikh faith, setting it apart from other religions mentioned.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how gunpowder technology was adopted in Europe due to its effectiveness in sieges, while China focused on improving horse archer units for mobile defense against nomads. This indicates a strategic difference in military priorities between the two regions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly compares the different approaches to gunpowder weaponry in Europe and China, highlighting how societies strategically shared and adapted technologies based on their specific needs. This directly relates to the question about technological exchange between societies.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet is referring to the world's silence and complicity in the face of apartheid, which can be interpreted as a form of whispered consent or acceptance. This suggests that the world condones and turns a blind eye to South Africa's discriminatory policies.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The poet contrasts the world's quiet disapproval of apartheid with South Africa's blatant actions, suggesting that the global economic system indirectly promotes and benefits from South Africa's discrimination. This interpretation aligns with the poem's broader message about the complicity of the world in oppression.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the ruler, through his actions and character, has gained or lost the favor of heaven, which is a key concept in Chinese political philosophy. The phrase suggests that the ruler's behavior will determine whether he maintains this favor or not, and that it is a result of his actions. This aligns with the idea of the 'Mandate of Heaven', where rulers are expected to govern justly and virtuously to maintain their right to rule.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the former kings of Xia faced calamities due to their lack of virtue. This implies that the current ruler, who inherited their legacy, likely met a similar fate as a result of natural disasters. Therefore, the correct answer is D: He was killed as a result of natural disasters.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage is an excerpt from Machiavelli's 'The Prince', a political treatise that offers a realistic view of power dynamics between rulers and their subjects. Machiavelli argues that it is safer for a ruler to be feared than loved, as the loyalty of subjects can be unreliable and fickle. This reflects a cynical attitude towards human nature and the complexities of politics.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's argument about the importance of fear over love in maintaining control clearly reflects a criticism of the religious establishment's reliance on faith and devotion, which he sees as unreliable tools for governance. This attitude is cynical and critical of human nature, suggesting that people are self-interested and ungrateful.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the creation of the world through the sacrifice of Purusa, which was divided into four parts: Brahman (mouth), Rajanaya (arms), Vaisya (thighs), and Sudra (feet). This division represents a clear apportionment of social roles, with each part corresponding to a specific caste. The passage directly contradicts the statement that 'The four divisions of human society are created by me [Krishna],' as it implies that the caste system was inherent in the creation of the world and thus pre-dates Krishna's role in the period mentioned.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The quote from Krishna, mentioning four divisions created by him, reinforces the idea of a rigid caste system where individuals are born into specific roles with limited social mobility. This directly contradicts the flexible nature of the quote about a Kshatriya's glory in battle, which could be interpreted as a choice rather than a predetermined role.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Mahatma Gandhi's message and his arrest, which was part of a larger movement for Indian independence and the Khilafat movement. The boycott mentioned is likely referring to the Swadeshi movement, where Indians boycotted foreign cloth and encouraged self-sufficiency in spinning and weaving. This movement gained momentum due to the decolonization process already underway in Africa, as it showed that colonies could successfully gain independence, inspiring similar movements in India.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The boycott's success was undoubtedly influenced by the decolonization process already underway in Africa, as it inspired and empowered Indians to resist colonial rule and demand independence. This movement gained momentum and led to the eventual end of British rule in India.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a tense situation where the US and the Soviet Union (SU) were in competition over Korea, with the US trying to prevent the SU from taking control of all of Korea. This suggests a competitive relationship, which is described as 'uneasy allies' as they are not fully trusting or cooperative but have a shared goal of containing the other side.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage clearly depicts the US and Soviets working together to manage the surrender of Japanese forces, demonstrating their close collaboration and shared goals as comrades-in-arms. They are allies in the context of the war, despite any potential future disagreements.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Europe and China had different priorities regarding military technology, with Europe focusing on gunpowder weapons for siege warfare and China prioritizing horse archer units to counter nomadic threats. This suggests that the traditional view challenged is that China has historically been less technologically advanced than Europe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that China's focus on horse archers over gunpowder was a strategic choice based on their specific threats. This challenges the view that China's progress was hindered by religious fundamentalism, which often opposes technological advancements. It also contradicts the notion that China was blind to technological benefits, as they actively chose not to pursue certain innovations.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker is advocating for Pan-Africanism, a movement that promotes unity and cooperation among African countries to achieve political and economic independence from colonial rule. This is evident in the quote where the speaker emphasizes the need for 'common purpose, common planning, and common endeavor', which are key principles of Pan-Africanism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah's call for African unity highlights the limitations of individual states and emphasizes the need for collaboration, suggesting a neocolonial approach where African nations work together under the guidance of former colonial powers. This is in contrast to nationalism, which promotes independence and self-rule, and socialism, which focuses on economic equality. Pan-Africanism, while similar to nationalism, emphasizes unity among all Africans, including those in the diaspora.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker expresses devotion to Brahman, a monotheistic concept, indicating a belief in one supreme being that encompasses all of existence. This suggests a religious view that aligns with monotheism rather than polytheism, where multiple gods are worshipped. Therefore, the correct answer is D, indicating a polytheistic religion is false.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's belief in an afterlife and the emphasis on faith suggest that salvation in this religion is achieved through right actions and right speech, earning favor with the gods. This indicates a mix of monotheistic and ethical principles.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a worker's anxiety about their job security, health, and old age, indicating a desire for stability and security. This led to the creation of social security measures like pensions and healthcare, ensuring workers' well-being even in illness or old age. This choice best reflects the impact of the speech on policy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's concern for worker insecurity and the lack of social safety nets clearly indicates that the resulting laws aimed to limit work hours in factories, providing workers with more stability and protection. This is reflected in the introduction of labour laws that regulated working conditions and limited work hours.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes a romanticized vision of New York, with references to its diverse culture and natural beauty. This suggests that the poet, Senghor, was inspired by his experience of living in the city and its unique atmosphere. This indicates strong transatlantic influences and a fusion of African and Western cultural elements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poet's lyrical portrayal of New York likely stems from the outmigration of Africans escaping political violence and seeking new opportunities in the United States, leading to a blending of cultural influences. This explanation best captures the unique perspective of an African poet writing about a place so distant from their homeland.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions that the soldiers are sent to the garrisons in the west, indicating a large-scale military campaign and a need for more troops, which is reflected in the line 'They call up more every day'. This suggests a strong bureaucracy as the government can organize and implement such a widespread conscription effort.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of widespread conscription and tax collection suggests a relatively high level of urbanization in Tang China, with a large population concentrated in cities, necessitating a strong bureaucracy for efficient administration. This is the most likely explanation for the poem's mention of 'the hundred districts east of the mountains throughout the land of Han'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 1949, was a response to the post-World War II international security landscape. It aimed to counter the perceived threat from the Soviet Union and its allies. The treaty emphasized collective defense, with Article 5 explicitly stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all, encouraging mutual aid and collective self-defense. This alliance provided a strategic response to the perceived threat of Soviet aggression.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty's emphasis on collective defense and the potential use of armed force suggests that it was signed in response to the monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities held by certain nations, prompting others to form an alliance for protection. This is indicated in Article 5, which states that any attack on one member is considered an attack on all, and the right to collective self-defense is asserted.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator is referring to a song about the 'Poor Winter King', who has stolen the crown of Bohemia. The song warns the king that he must stay away from Rhine and Prague, which are likely important locations in the Holy Roman Empire, as the song mentions seeking forgiveness from Ferdinand, who is the rightful king of Bohemia within the empire.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator's reference to Rhine and Prague suggests these are significant locations for the Winter King's planned pilgrimage, possibly seeking redemption or spiritual guidance after his defeat. This is supported by the context of the song, which mentions the Winter King's naughty act of snatching the kaiser's crown and the subsequent consequences.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text from John of Damascus supports the use of images as a means to convey understanding, while the Second Council of Nicaea emphasizes the importance of depicting the incarnation of God as real and not just fantastic. These sentiments are contrary to the idea that religious images are idolatrous, which is a core belief opposed by movements like Buddhism, which emphasizes detachment from material forms, and Jainism, which bans all representations of life. Sunni Islam also opposes such practices, but for different reasons, focusing more on the importance of faith over external symbols.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages advocate for the use of holy images as tools for religious understanding, which directly contradicts the principles of Buddhism, a religion that emphasizes meditation and inner reflection over external representations. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Buddhism.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The United Nations, as mentioned in the treaty excerpt, is an intergovernmental body that aims to promote international cooperation and world peace. It is dedicated to providing a platform for nations to resolve disputes peacefully through negotiation and arbitration, thus answering choice C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of the United Nations in the treaty suggests it is an organization dedicated to asserting a particular ideological tenet over the world, promoting its values and principles as the basis for international relations. This is evident from Articles 1 and 2, which emphasize the commitment to peaceful resolution, mutual understanding, and the promotion of stability through economic collaboration. While Article 3 mentions self-defense, it is in relation to an armed attack, not a tenet or ideology.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The quote describes Brahman as encompassing all existence and being loving and silent, implying an omnipresent and benevolent force. This description aligns with the concept of Brahman in Hinduism as the ultimate reality, a divine presence that is both immanent (present everywhere) and transcendent (beyond form).",A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Brahman as a spirit residing within the hearts of individuals, suggesting that he is found in a specific location, similar to the concept of Heaven in other religions. This description does not mention him being vengeful or limited to the hearts of only the faithful.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Mongol Empire, under Chinggis Khan, promoted peace and tolerance among diverse peoples, allowing them to maintain their local traditions. This stands in contrast to the Persian Empire, which is often associated with a more centralized, homogenous society. Therefore, the statement most accurately comparing the two empires is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of various religions and their vast empire encompassed diverse belief systems, likely leading to the creation of a new syncretic religion. On the other hand, the Persians had a strong monotheistic faith that remained dominant.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes vivid imagery of nature and the beauty of New York, which aligns with the Romantic movement's focus on nature and emotion. The mention of 'musk alligators' and 'sea cows' suggests a connection to the natural world, while the reference to God creating the earth in six days and sleeping on the seventh day could be a nod to religious themes explored in Romanticism. Therefore, the most likely inspiration for this verse is the Romantic movement.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's focus on nature, emotions, and vivid imagery aligns with the core principles of the Romantic movement, which emphasized individualism and a connection to the natural world. While Surrealism is also known for its imaginative and dreamlike imagery, it often explores subconscious desires and fears. The rise of mass media and the Jazz Age are not likely to have inspired this particular piece.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther, a German monk and priest, is best known as the founder of the Reformation, a movement that led to the split of the Catholic Church in Western Christianity. He criticized the Catholic Church for its corruption and abuses, particularly the sale of indulgences. His writings and teachings inspired other reformers like Ulrich Zwingli in Switzerland, who shared similar views on church reform and the authority of the Pope. Both Luther and Zwingli advocated for a purer form of Christianity, free from what they saw as the corrupt influences of the Catholic Church.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther were key figures in the Protestant Reformation and challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, so their views must have been similar. Zwingli, like Luther, believed that the Temporal Power should not have jurisdiction over Spirituality and questioned the need for intermediaries like the Pope to interpret Scripture. They also shared concerns about the wealth and power of the Catholic clergy, which they saw as a corruption of Christian teachings.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the creation of the world and the division of Purusa, a Hindu concept representing primordial matter or substance. It mentions the birth of various creatures and classes of people from different parts of Purusa, indicating a hierarchical view of society rooted in Hindu philosophy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a sacrifice that leads to the creation of the world and different castes, suggesting that good deeds and sacrifices are essential for achieving enlightenment and improving one's karma. This aligns with the concept of 'The importance of sacrifice to the gods' in Hindu religion.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Albert Camus, a prominent French-Algerian author and philosopher, is best known for his contributions to existentialism, often exploring the absurdity of life and the search for meaning in his works. The quoted passage aligns with his existentialist views on the human condition and the search for purpose.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author's questioning of meaning and the nature of existence aligns with the principles of New Age syncretism, which seeks to blend various spiritual and philosophical perspectives. Camus' thoughts on the absurd and his focus on human understanding are key indicators of this movement.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a historical event where the Chamavi and Angrivarii, two barbarian tribes, were defeated and exterminated by a combination of neighboring tribes with the help of the Romans. This indicates that the surrounding tribes utilized the opportunity to exploit their enemies' weakness and gain power, which is similar to the treatment of barbarian tribes during the period in question.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the conflict between barbarian tribes and the Roman Empire, suggesting that barbarian peoples were often converted to Christianity as part of their integration into Roman society. This is similar to the process of Christianization during the early medieval period, where barbarian tribes adopted Christianity as a means of assimilation.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the British citizen is suing the government for damages caused by a group of natives, indicating that they were not welcome in the area and may have been seen as intruders. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 established clear colonial boundaries, which would have made it safer for Europeans to move into previously unsettled areas.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference established clear boundaries and regulations for European colonization in Africa, making it easier for Europeans to move to Zulu lands and establish settlements. This conference provided a logical explanation and encouragement for European expansion.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Declaration of the Rights of Woman, which was published in 1791 and called for equal rights for women. This led to a shift in societal perceptions and legal status for women, but it did not immediately grant them political equality or the right to vote. Therefore, the correct answer is that French women's status remained unchanged for a period after the publication of the declaration.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the disappointment and frustration of women who had hoped for greater equality after the French Revolution, suggesting that their status actually declined as they faced continued discrimination and exclusion from political life. This outcome is most closely described in choice C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The song 'Poor Winter King' from the 17th century addresses the issue of royal succession and the dispute over the Bohemian throne between Ferdinand and Frederick. The lyrics indicate that Frederick's actions were seen as a transgression against the established rules of succession, which is the primary underlying issue in this song.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The song's mocking tone and criticism of the ""Winter King"" suggest underlying social class conflicts and resentment towards the privileges and authority of the ruling elite. This is reflected in the lyrics, where the singer addresses the ""naughty"" king and his actions that have brought shame upon him and his kingdom.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the resilience of Latin America, its rich history, and its cultural heritage, which includes a strong spiritual connection to God. Despite external threats and challenges, Latin America has endured and continues to thrive. This suggests that the theme of the poem is the strength and resilience of Latin American culture, which is not easily broken or conquered.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem acknowledges the power and influence of the United States while emphasizing the resilience of Latin American culture, suggesting that change and progress are inevitable, even if they come through external forces. This indicates a theme of acceptance and adaptation rather than resistance or naivety.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, a Ghanian leader and a prominent Pan-Africanist, advocates for a political union of African states to gain global respect and present a united front against the world powers' neglect and disregard for African interests. This strongly aligns with the ideology of Pan-Africanism, which promotes unity and solidarity among all people of African descent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's emphasis on African unity and self-determination aligns with the principles of neocolonialism, which sought to maintain European influence in Africa through economic and political partnerships. While he advocates for a united Africa, his argument also highlights the lack of respect and attention given to African interests by world powers, which is a key critique of neocolonialism.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a champion from Syria challenging the speaker, who is likely an Egyptian military leader, to a duel. This suggests that the ruler of Syria values martial prowess and success in battle as a way to gain prestige and favor, indicating a society that values military might and individual achievement.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a champion representing his tribe and seeking to take the narrator's cattle, indicating that clans were the basic political units in Egyptian society and played a significant role in conflicts and rivalries. This suggests that the text reflects a social hierarchy with clan loyalty and ambition influencing power dynamics.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the French and English kings with contrasting features, indicating a political shift in Europe during the 18th century, which was a time of enlightenment and intellectual exploration, associated with the Enlightenment movement.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were influenced by the principles of mercantilism, which emphasized economic competition and the accumulation of wealth through trade and colonization. These revolutions were driven by a desire for political and social change, often in opposition to established monarchies and religious institutions. The Enlightenment provided the intellectual foundation with its focus on reason, individual rights, and secular governance.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the trade practices of the Portuguese sailors when they visited Canton (now Guangzhou), a major port city in China, to engage in trade with the Chinese. They had to register their names upon arrival and departure, stay within the city for a limited time, and sleep outside the city walls in their boats. This suggests that there were trade regulations and restrictions in place, indicating the development of a centralized trading system dominated by the Chinese government. Option A is the most appropriate answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the Portuguese trade route between Macao and Japan, highlighting the exchange of goods and the presence of Portuguese merchants, which suggests the influence of Jesuit missionaries who often accompanied traders and facilitated cultural exchange. This directly supports answer choice D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage argues that it is hypocritical for Britain, knowing the harmful effects of opium, to sell it to China while banning it in their own country. This appeal to moral consistency and the author's belief that all substances banned in one's own country should also be prohibited when exported forms the basis of the argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author emphasizes China's economic and moral superiority over Britain, suggesting that Britain should fear the potential military consequences of its harmful opium trade and China's righteous anger. This suggests that the argument primarily revolves around the idea of self-interest and the potential for harm to one's own country.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a historical context where children were forced to work in factories due to poverty and lack of resources, indicating a system that allowed for little to no regulation or protection of workers' rights. This is reminiscent of the laissez-faire economic philosophy, which favors minimal government intervention in the free market and limited regulations on businesses.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a system with minimal government intervention in business and labor practices, aligning with the principles of corporatism, where the state and corporations work together to regulate the economy and social affairs. This is evident from the testimony, which suggests that workers are vulnerable and have limited options due to economic necessity.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system of exploitation and abuse of indigenous people working in silver mines, where they are forced to work long hours with no pay or proper accommodation, and their labor is used as an excuse for other activities like herding cattle and serving as concubines for mine owners. This suggests a form of debt slavery, where the workers are in constant debt to their employers and have no way to escape their situation without facing severe consequences.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in Spanish South American mines, indicating that the king of Spain was likely unaware of or unconcerned about the suffering of his subjects in the colonies. This suggests a lack of interest in their welfare.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the French and American revolutions were responses to social and political injustices, with a focus on class structure and taxation. The French Revolution was sparked by the 'unfair' tax system and the privileges of the clergy, while the American Revolution was a response to British taxes and the power of the monarchy. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both the American and French Revolutions were fueled by discontent with the power and influence of religious leaders, who often held significant political and economic authority, similar to the challenges posed during the Protestant Reformation. This is a key similarity between the two events.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the complex situation of a group of people who are both native to and foreign in a new land, struggling for ownership and freedom while also facing internal challenges due to their passive political role and lack of knowledge. This context aligns with Simón Bolívar's message, as he was a key figure in the struggle for independence in Latin America, leading the first successful rebellion against Spanish rule.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes Simón Bolívar's mixed-race identity and his struggle against both Spanish rule and native resistance, suggesting that he likely led a political coup to challenge the existing power structures and assert the rights of mixed-race individuals. This coup could be considered the first of its kind, as it was led by someone who embodied the complex racial dynamics of the time.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Ibn Battuta, a famous traveler from the 14th century, described his experience in Aden, Yemen, which is surrounded by mountains and has limited access to water sources. This description contrasts with that of Zheng He, who explored the Pacific Ocean and had access to vast resources on his ships, including water.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Ibn Battuta and Zheng He were renowned travelers who journeyed extensively and documented their experiences, suggesting that their encounters with diverse cultures and societies must have been quite similar. However, the description of Aden, a port city in Yemen, suggests a very different experience from what one might encounter during the voyages of Zheng He, who primarily interacted with Southeast Asian countries along the Silk Road.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Western European capitalists actively extended their exploitation to Africa, which directly implicates them in its underdevelopment. The expansion of the slave trade for labor is a direct result of this exploitation and had significant negative economic impacts on Africa.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The slave trade, regardless of who conducted it, involved the removal of a significant portion of the African population, which would undoubtedly hinder development. This is the most direct way in which Western interests affected Africa negatively.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a complex political situation involving indigenous people struggling for ownership rights and freedom from external invasion, which aligns with the context of the South American independence movement. The mention of 'deceit' and 'superstition' suggests a critique of colonial rule, often associated with European powers in the region during the time of independence movements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The text clearly describes a population seeking self-governance and resisting external control, aligning with the concept of political autonomy. This is evident in Simón Bolívar's message to the Congress of Angostura, where he expresses the complexities of their position as a mixed group struggling for ownership rights and freedom from both internal and external oppressors. The context aligns best with the fight for political autonomy in the Philippines.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Roman Empire encouraged rival tribes to destroy each other, which aligns with option A. This strategy was employed to reduce potential threats and maintain control.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that empires benefited from the influx of barbarian peoples who could contribute to the empire's workforce and economic growth. This is in contrast to option C, which states that military force was used against all neighboring barbarian tribes. Option B is also incorrect as it suggests a welcoming attitude towards migrations, whereas the text implies that the arrival of the Tencteri and Bructeri caused concern and led to their eventual destruction.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The historian would likely use this data to argue that literacy rates improved significantly under communist rule, indicating a success in spreading education and a departure from the illiteracy prevalent in Imperial Russia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The dramatic rise in literacy rates suggests that the Soviet Union's communist system was more effective in achieving its goals compared to other communist nations like China. This is because improving education was a key focus of their ideology, and the data shows a clear upward trend under their rule.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concerns raised by Lord Ii regarding Japan's outdated systems and the potential consequences of not adapting to modern advancements. Option C is the most appropriate response as it indicates a willingness to learn from others, which is essential for growth and development in a rapidly changing world.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To address the concerns about foreign powers, Japan likely needed to completely reform its outdated systems, starting with the Chinese-style civil service. This would allow them to build a modern army and navigate the changing global landscape effectively.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The provided texts are excerpts from the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States. These acts reflect a growing trend of xenophobia and racial discrimination towards Chinese immigrants during the 19th century in these countries. This was a time when anti-immigrant sentiment was on the rise, often fueled by fears of competition for jobs and cultural differences. The texts demonstrate how policies were implemented to restrict Chinese labor and entry into these nations, indicating a prominent social trend of the era.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages highlight the selective nature of immigration policies, aiming to attract skilled workers while restricting the entry of unskilled laborers. This trend reflects a growing desire to control and manage the flow of immigrants based on their perceived skills, which was a prominent feature of the 19th century.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the speech of Pope Urban II, who was referring to the fall of Constantinople to the Seljuk Turks in 1354, an event that led to the creation of the First Crusade. This crusade was a religious war aimed at reclaiming the city and protecting Christian lands.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The reference to Constantinople likely alludes to the earlier invasions and threats from groups like the Avars and Bulgars, who posed a significant challenge to the Byzantine Empire. However, the most direct inspiration for Urban II's invocation was probably the recent invasion of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks, which had threatened Christian lands and the Byzantine Empire itself.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's quote emphasizes the need for a socialist transformation of agriculture to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. This transformation is described as 'step-by-step' and aims to eliminate the rich-peasant economy, suggesting that individual land ownership must be collectivized. Collectivization was a key feature of China's socialist agricultural policy under Mao, which allowed for shared access to fields and resources, addressing the issue of poverty and inequality in the countryside.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The socialist transformation likely involved a shift of agricultural workforce towards industrial centers, contributing to rapid urbanization and industrial development. This would lead to an increase in state investment in agriculture, improving productivity and living standards.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The literacy rate among the Russian population increased significantly over the given period, with a notable jump after World War I and during the Soviet era. This indicates a focus on education initiatives, which would have primarily benefited the urban middle class and rural peasantry, as they are the main drivers of economic growth and social mobility in any society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increased literacy would greatly benefit the clergy, allowing them to better interpret and disseminate religious texts and teachings to the population. The urban middle class would also gain access to a wider range of knowledge and educational opportunities, which could enhance their social standing and economic prospects. While officers in the armed forces may have benefited from improved literacy, it is unlikely that they would be the segment to benefit the most out of these options.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a ruler's military successes and glory, indicating that victories against outsiders enhanced their legitimacy and power, which is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Conflicts between states primarily served to provide the victors with a source of slaves and resources, which were crucial for sustaining their agricultural systems and economies. This is especially true in the context of ancient civilizations, where labor was largely dependent on agriculture. Therefore, victories against outsiders not only granted legitimacy to rulers but also provided them with the means to support their rule.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a set of rules for women in ancient Chinese society, emphasizing their role in domestic duties, ancestor worship, and maintaining a pure and orderly life. This reflects the patriarchal values of the time, where women were expected to serve their husbands and uphold traditional gender roles.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage underscores the importance of women fulfilling their roles in maintaining the household and upholding ancestral traditions through rituals and offerings. This aligns with the theme of patriarchal societal expectations, where women are expected to serve and uphold family honor.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Bonesteel's attempt to strike a balance in the division of Korea, aiming to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing too much territory. This strategy aligns with the policy of containment, which aimed to limit the spread of communism and control the influence of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concern over Soviet expansion aligns with the Cold War strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction, where the threat of retaliation deterred aggressive actions. This policy aimed to prevent the spread of communism and was a key aspect of US foreign policy during the Cold War era.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech emphasizes the British determination to resist any potential invasion by Nazi Germany, indicating that they are not afraid to fight and will not surrender. This is in contrast to Hitler's statement about being forced to sign the Versailles Treaty under threat of force, suggesting that Britain was not willing to compromise or negotiate with the Axis powers.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Churchill's speech likely refers to the need for Britain to secure trade deals with American manufacturers to bolster its military capabilities against the Axis powers. This is evident from the mention of 'the seas and oceans' and 'in the air', indicating a focus on naval and aerial power. While invasion fears are mentioned, the emphasis is on resistance and not surrendering, which aligns with maintaining trade for economic strength.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes trade patterns between Europe, Asia, and China during the early modern period. The Portuguese dominated this trade route, bringing goods from India to Japan and China, and vice versa. This was disrupted by the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan in 1603, which restricted foreign trade and isolated Japan for over two centuries.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish conquest of Mexico and subsequent control over trade routes in the Pacific likely disrupted the established trade patterns between Portugal, China, and Japan. This event would have had a significant impact on the economic exchange mentioned in the passage.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage mentions that some theorists believed jihad was defensive, but most authorities felt it didn't end until Islam conquered the world. This indicates a range of beliefs and suggests that the second passage contradicts traditional assumptions about religious obligations during the crusading era. It shows how Muslims were not necessarily less religious than Christians in terms of their obligations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage suggests that Muslims, despite their religious obligations, exhibited greater tolerance and kindness towards Christians during the Crusades compared to the treatment Christians showed towards Muslims. This indicates a potential disconnect between religious beliefs and actions, with Muslims being more inclusive and less antagonistic.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage suggests that the practice of sati, where a widow burns herself alive with her husband's body, was not solely a religious practice but also a way for the British Empire to exert control and ensure their dominance over the Indian population. This indicates a desire to enforce Western norms and values on native cultures, which is in contrast to the commonly held assumption that European colonizers simply wanted to turn profits.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage demonstrates that European colonizers often intervened in the religious practices of native populations, as seen in the example of the suppression of sati. This intervention was often justified by the belief that native cultures needed to be 'brought under control' and made to understand their dependence on the colonizers for trade. This suggests a lack of respect for cultural differences and an attempt to enforce Western norms, undermining the assumption of cultural sensitivity in imperialism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the arrest of Maulana Ahmed Ali, a prominent Muslim leader, was seen as a positive step towards achieving Swaraj and addressing the Khilafat and Punjab wrongs if non-violence is maintained. This suggests that the instructions to boycott foreign cloth are inspired by the desire for Indian independence and religious freedom, which aligns with the historical context of the period 1450–1750 CE when various Muslim empires ruled India and there was a struggle for independence and religious freedom.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The call to boycott foreign cloth likely drew inspiration from the historical experience of India under the rule of Muslim empires, where local industries suffered due to competition from imported goods. This led to a rise in protectionist policies and a focus on self-reliance, which aligns with Gandhi's message.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Cawnpore Massacre, where Indian rebels killed British civilians during the 1857 revolt. This act was driven by a sense of revenge and a desire to assert native power and religion against British rule. It was a violent response to perceived colonial oppression and a challenge to the British monopoly on violence in India.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While the Cawnpore Massacre was a brutal event, it might be understood within the context of local military customs and traditions, which may differ from Western norms. This interpretation is supported by Rudrangshu Mukherjee's mention of the hierarchical view of 'civilized' vs 'uncivilized', where the latter were dehumanized and treated as animals, justifying extreme violence. Thus, the massacre can be seen as a reaction to the perceived systemic brute force of British rule.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Western Europe achieved global hegemony through exploitation and expansion, which aligns with the colonization of North and South America during this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Crosby's argument likely refers to the Industrial Revolution, where European nations needed vast resources and markets to fuel their industrial growth, leading to the exploitation of other continents. The Industrial Revolution occurred between 1760-1840, so it is the most recent development mentioned that would align with Crosby's argument about resource acquisition for post-quantum leap productivity.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that natives are forced to pay 'zakas' or tribute, which is a form of forced labor. This is similar to the 'mita' system described in the first passage, where Indians were forced to work in mines. This would be a significant burden on the natives and explain their decline in fortune.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The decline in fur-bearing animals likely resulted from competition with Russian hunters and trappers who also sought these valuable resources, making it difficult for natives to fulfill their tribute obligations. This is the most plausible explanation as it directly addresses the issue of overhunting and depletion of fur-bearing animals mentioned in the passage.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's 'Call to Power' indicates a Marxist philosophy, as he advocates for the seizure of power on behalf of the proletariat, which is a central tenet of Marxism. This aligns with his belief in the need to 'give the government the death-blow' and seize control to bring about revolutionary change.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Lenin's emphasis on seizing power and controlling resources aligns with the core principles of capitalism, where individuals strive to maximize their own wealth and control over the economy. This is in contrast to mercantilism, which focuses on a nation's trade balance and accumulation of precious metals, and fascism, which emphasizes strong central leadership and national glory. While Marxism shares some similarities with Lenin's ideology, it differs as Lenin sought power through revolution, whereas Marxism typically advocates for a gradual transformation through class struggle.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem ' Sharpeville' by Dennis Brutus describes a tragic event in South Africa's history, where black South Africans protested against the requirement to carry identity and residence papers. The poem emphasizes the brutality of the police response, with bullets hitting unarmed protesters from behind, including a mother holding her child. This event symbolizes the oppression and racial dominance inherent in apartheid, making it a pivotal moment that brought the world's attention to the regime's oppressive nature.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Boer War, with its focus on racial tensions and power struggles, ultimately led to the dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a more equitable society in South Africa. This event symbolized the end of institutionalized discrimination.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a community where male inheritance is through the maternal line, which is a unique practice that aligns with Islamic law. This indicates a strong understanding and adherence to Islamic teachings, as well as a commitment to preserving family ties.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the Malians' openness to friendships between men and women outside of family, demonstrating their commitment to inclusivity and tolerance, which are central tenets of Islam. While they adhere to Islamic law, their interpretation seems relaxed compared to more conservative interpretations, indicating a sincere faith that influences their daily lives.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker is a French revolutionary leader during the time of the French Revolution, and they are concerned about internal threats to the Republic. They mention smothering 'enemies' and 'counter-revolutionary opponents', indicating that they see these as the primary concerns. While foreign invaders and transnational corporations could also be considered, the passage specifically mentions counter-revolutionary forces as the main threat.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against the enemies of the Republic suggests a fear of communist agitators who aimed to overthrow the existing social order and establish a classless society. This threat aligns with his belief in the necessity of using extreme measures to protect the ideals of the French Revolution, which were under challenge from both internal and external forces.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great, despite being surrounded by evidence of civil and political rights in Protestant Europe, continued to rule Russia with an autocratic style, indicating that he believed in a strongman leadership model. He sought to transform Russia from within, using persuasion and force if necessary, which aligns with the choice that best describes his practice: 'transforming' or 'driving' the nation forward, even through forceful means.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Peter the Great's determination to modernize Russia and his willingness to use force suggest a belief in decentralizing power and empowering the people to participate in the decision-making process. This is reflected in his efforts to reform the country, which included establishing parliaments and constitutions that granted certain rights to individuals.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Confucian teachings being used to reinforce the social hierarchy and uphold the importance of filial piety, which aligns with option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Confucius' teachings on filial piety, with their emphasis on respect for parents and elders, aimed to promote gender equality by ensuring that both sons and daughters had equal responsibilities and rights within the family structure. This was a radical concept in a time where patriarchy and male dominance were the norm. The answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans in Spanish-controlled mines, including long working hours with no pay, forced labor outside their job description, and being made to work as servants or concubines. This suggests a significant loss of human capital and a decline in living standards for the affected communities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment of indigenous populations and the disruption of their traditional ways of life, clearly demonstrating the dramatic alteration of New World religious traditions and social customs due to European influence. This conclusion is supported by the text as the primary source of information about the period in question.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speech by Pope Urban II was delivered in 1095 CE, and it called for a crusade to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim rule during the First Crusade. This event occurred in the context of the Middle Ages, a period marked by religious conflicts and the expansion of Christian and Islamic empires. Therefore, the correct answer is D: The Crusades.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  The Pope's call to reclaim Jerusalem from 'unclean nations' aligns with the Age of Discovery's spirit of exploration and expansion, where European powers sought to discover new lands and spread their influence across the globe. This era also coincided with the Crusades, a religious war fought to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a witness testifying about the working conditions and wages of workers, particularly children. The witness states that they have no fixed wages but earn some money through various jobs, indicating a need to work for survival. They also mention that a child's wage of 3 shillings is insufficient for their subsistence. This suggests that the witness is referring to the industrial revolution era, where child labor was prevalent and working conditions were often poor. The answer is C: Labor unions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Joint-stock companies, with their focus on collective ownership and shared profits, played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and improving working conditions during the Industrial Revolution. The passage mentions that these companies influenced the system, which likely refers to the improvement of wages and hours for workers.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that political independence is not enough to overcome the legacy of colonial rule and that unity, common purpose, planning, and endeavor are necessary for true progress. This implies that a lack of these factors would hinder the fulfillment of the described dreams. Among the choices, only 'A' directly contradicts the theme of unity and shared identity, which is emphasized in the quote.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Africa's struggle to achieve unity and progress can be attributed to its shortage of natural resources, which limited its economic potential and hindered its ability to compete on the global stage. This lack of resources and economic development is a key factor that has prevented African nations from fully realizing their political dreams of unity and progress.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a growing gap between rich and poor peasants in the countryside, with some becoming 'new rich peasants' while many others remain poor due to a lack of means of production. This suggests that the current system is capitalist, where private ownership and market forces are dominant. Mao Zedong's quote advocates for collective ownership and the elimination of private economic activities, which is a characteristic of socialism. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's concerns about the growing wealth gap and the potential for social unrest indicate a move towards liberal political and economic reforms, aimed at empowering individuals and fostering economic development. This aligns with option A.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the hardships faced by soldiers in the Tang dynasty, including oppressive taxation and a lack of support from local communities due to their sons being drafted into the army. This leads to discontent and a sense of powerlessness among the peasantry, which can be seen as a major cause of the later decline of the Tang dynasty.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's depiction of constant warfare and the hardships faced by soldiers suggest that foreign invasions and the need to defend the empire's borders were major contributing factors to the decline of the Tang dynasty. This is evident in the lines, 'The frontier garrisons run with blood, enough to fill an ocean,' and 'There must be ten thousand villages that brambles now infest/ Throughout the land of Han.'",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the growing polarization of peasants in China, with some becoming rich and others falling into poverty due to capitalist forces. This leads to a breakdown of the traditional worker-peasant alliance, requiring a new approach to address the issue. The only solution presented is to bring about socialist transformation, cooperation, and elimination of private economic practices, which directly contributes to the expansion of Maoism and a shift away from Soviet-style communism.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation of the peasant economy and the focus on collective farming methods directly contributed to the Green Revolution, which aimed to increase agricultural productivity and improve food security through technological advancements and modern farming techniques. This movement had a significant impact on global agriculture and improved living standards in many countries.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt describes a slave trade caravan, where the prices for slaves vary based on their age and gender. This suggests that the slaves were being sold as commodities for labor, which is characteristic of plantations in the New World, particularly in North America and Brazil. Therefore, the most likely destination for the captured slaves is cotton plantations in North America.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given the high value placed on young women and the brutal treatment of the slaves, it is likely that they were destined for cotton plantations in North America, where slave labor was extensively used in the cotton production process. This was a common practice during the time period mentioned.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the democratic principles of ancient Greece, where male citizens had political rights and could participate in the assembly, or ekklesia, to discuss and vote on laws. This suggests that only adult males born within the state had a say in the democratic process.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the inclusive nature of Athenian democracy, where all adult men and women who were citizens by birth had the right to participate in the political process and contribute to the governance of the state. This includes both male and female citizens within the defined geographical boundaries.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker in the second passage expresses disappointment that, despite gaining independence, their situation has not improved significantly. This suggests that factors such as poverty and a lack of education persist, indicating that a lack of industrial assets or infrastructure may have prevented the desired progress.",B,Let's reason step by step. The speaker's disappointment likely stems from the new elites' resistance to women's rights and their reluctance to implement social reforms that would empower women and improve their status in society. This suggests that the main factor preventing progress is 'hostility to women's rights on the part of new elites'.,C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty is a collective defense agreement, also known as the Washington Treaty. It emphasizes mutual aid and collective security among its members, with Article 5 specifically guaranteeing collective self-defense against armed attack. This clearly supports the concept of 'collective defense'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, with its emphasis on collective action and mutual aid against threats, aligns with the principles of communism, where nations work together to achieve common goals and defend against external aggression. While capitalism and communism are often seen as opposing ideologies, the treaty's focus on collective defense and mutual support aligns more closely with communist ideals.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the rapid modernization and industrialization of foreign states, particularly in terms of military power, which aligns with the Meiji Restoration, a period of significant change and Westernization in Japan following the Tokugawa Shogunate. The quote mentions the fear that Japan's outdated systems might lead to disaster in the face of these powerful nations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concerns about foreign advancements and the need for modernization suggest that the era following the passage is the Tokugawa Shogunate, a period marked by Japan's isolationist policies and resistance to external influences. This era ended with the Meiji Restoration, which brought significant changes and marked the end of the shogunate.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 1 directly quotes Adolf Hitler, indicating his sentiment towards the Versailles Treaty, which was a result of World War I. This is supported by Source 2, where Winston Churchill, speaking for Britain during World War II, emphasizes their determination to never surrender and fight until the end. This historical context suggests that the background for Hitler's statement is the belief that Germany had been unfairly treated after World War I and that the Versailles Treaty was a symbol of this injustice.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hitler's strong opposition to the Treaty of Versailles was rooted in his belief that Poland's territorial borders should not be violated and that Germany had a right to reclaim lands lost after World War I. This belief is reflected in Source 1, where he mentions being forced to sign the treaty 'with pistols at our head'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that China focused on improving horse archer units as they were more effective against nomads, who posed the biggest threat to them. This suggests that China prioritized their military needs and chose to invest in existing, more mobile forces over heavier, less maneuverable gunpowder weapons.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Chinese failure to innovate in gunpowder weaponry can be attributed to their overconfidence in the numerical strength of their existing armed forces, leading them to believe that further technological advancements were unnecessary. This is indicated by their focus on improving horse archer units, which were more effective against their primary threat - nomadic warriors - than large-scale, slow-moving cannons.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passages highlight contrasting perspectives on the impact of revolutions, with one expressing disappointment in the lack of tangible improvements and the other highlighting the potential for inequality and disregard despite freedom being gained. This suggests that revolutions may not always lead to equitable outcomes or immediate positive change.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both Olympe de Gouges and Halima Ghomri experienced disappointment and lack of improvement in their lives after their respective revolutions, which suggests revolutions generally fail to benefit women and minorities. While the first statement is also true for men, it is not as relevant here.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage from Paul of Aegina describes a specific method for treating a thigh fracture, indicating that medical knowledge was exchanged between ancient cultures. This exchange likely occurred during the period mentioned, as it was a time of active cultural and scientific exchanges between civilizations. The passage from Ibn Sina (Avicenna) emphasizes the importance of understanding causes and symptoms in medicine, which aligns with the focus on knowledge transfer and the exchange of medical practices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions Aegina and the Mediterranean, which are close to Mesoamerica, indicating a possible influence of Mesoamerican science on European medical practices. This exchange is often referred to as the 'Aegina-Mesoamerican connection'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided excerpts are from historical sources, with one referring to Tsar Nicholas II's abdication in 1917 during a time of significant political and military turmoil. The context suggests that the country was facing a dire situation, with internal troubles and external threats. The text implies that the abdication was an attempt to unite the nation and secure victory in the face of these challenges, indicating a desire to overcome obstacles and achieve a positive outcome. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Large-scale military losses and resentment of the working classes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nicholas II mentions the 'happiness of the people,' suggesting that economic prosperity and dissatisfaction with the aristocracy led to his abdication. While there is some truth to all the options, this context specifically mentions the people's happiness as a factor.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Source 2, the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, establishes that the Catholic Apostolic Roman Religion is the official religion and allows for private religious worship of other faiths. This indicates a preference for one religion over others, suggesting religious uniformity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Brazilian constitution mentions a hereditary monarchy and the Catholic religion as the religion of the Empire, suggesting a connection between religious authority and the divine right of monarchs. This indicates that religious authority supported the rule of monarchs during this period.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poet is highlighting the cultural and intellectual heritage of Latin America, emphasizing its long history of poetry and astronomical knowledge. This suggests that the poet wants to showcase the region's rich cultural and intellectual legacy, which includes a tradition of poetry and an understanding of the stars.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The mention of consulting the stars and having poets since ancient times suggests that Latin America has a history of scientific inquiry and astronomical knowledge. This is further supported by the reference to 'the remote times' and 'since the ancient times', indicating a long history of such practices.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The phrase ""his Indians"" in the quote suggests a system of forced labor, where the Spanish nobleman had indigenous people working for him as slaves or indentured servants to provide food and other necessities. This practice is known as the encomienda system, a form of forced labor in which Native Americans were required to work on Spanish-owned land in exchange for protection and religious instruction.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The nobleman likely had indigenous people working for him as apprentices, learning agricultural techniques in exchange for food and shelter. This was a common practice during the colonial era, where Europeans would bring over their own crops and animals to the New World and rely on the indigenous population for labor.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage suggests that some Muslims at the time believed in defensive jihad, while the second passage indicates Christian treatment of Muslims as peaceful and religious. This contradicts the notion that Muslims were inherently violent during the crusading era.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the duty of jihad and the goal of bringing the world under Islamic sway, indicating that many Muslims during the Crusades were inherently violent and driven by their faith to conquer others. This supports the statement that many Muslims during this era were 'driven by Islamic faith to be inherently violent'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text is a quote from Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated for non-violent resistance and unity during his time. His message emphasizes remaining non-violent, which aligns with the principles of the civil rights movement in the United States that fought for minority rights without resorting to violence. This historical context matches the given statement, making it the most likely inspiration for the instructions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violent resistance likely inspired the Zionist movement, as they both employed civil disobedience and peaceful protests to achieve their goals. The Zionist movement led to the creation of Israel, a nation that came into existence despite regional conflict and violence.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a narrative where the speaker boasts about their military prowess and success, specifically mentioning conquest, destruction, and capture of resources. This indicates an aggressive foreign policy, which is best described as expansionist and imperialistic. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: war with the Hittites over control of Syria and the Levant.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem mentions a champion of Syria, which suggests a conflict with the successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great's empire for control of the Eastern Mediterranean. This was a common theme in the foreign policy of the Egyptian New Kingdom.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from *Journey to the West* describes the story of the Chinese monk Xuanzang, who was known for his religious travels and scholarship. The text complicates historians' understanding of Xuanzang's career as it is a fictionalized account, likely written decades after his death, and may not accurately represent his actual life and achievements. Therefore, the correct answer is that it 'highly fictionalizes the story of Xuanzang's accomplishments'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt was written centuries after Xuanzang lived, making it unreliable and irrelevant to understanding his actual career. It adds fictional elements that complicate the historical record.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concept of self-realization and spiritual enlightenment, which is a core tenet of Buddhism. This quote aligns with the teachings of Buddhism, as it emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and pure thoughts, which are integral to Buddhist philosophy. Thus, the correct answer is D, indicating that the Mauryan emperor Ashoka promoted Buddhist edicts.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the self and controlling the mind, which aligns with Ashoka's efforts to eradicate traditional Hinduism and promote Buddhism. This suggests that the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the trade of copper and gold, with the copper being collected as a form of tribute from certain nations and then traded for gold. This suggests that the nation collecting the copper had access to these resources and likely had some level of technological advancement in mining, supporting option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the extraction of gold from pits, indicating that Mali possessed advanced mining technologies that contributed to its wealth. This suggests that option D is the most supported inference.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The poem is an ode to America, celebrating its diverse cultures and history, with a particular focus on its Spanish heritage. It mentions figures like Montezuma, the Incas, Christopher Columbus, and Cuauhtémoc, all of whom are associated with Spain's colonial past in the Americas. The poet expresses pride in America's resilience, love for life, and connection to the sun, which could be a reference to the Aztec and Inca cultures. The poem also hints at a warning about foreign invasion, specifically mentioning Roosevelt and the ""fearful rifleman,"" which could be a reference to American imperialism. The context of the poem suggests that it was written in response to recent events involving America's involvement in Latin America, such as the Cuban revolution or the Haitian Revolution.",D,Let's reason step by step. The poem's themes of resistance against a powerful invader and the mention of 'barbarous soul' suggest it was written in response to the Haitian Revolution and the fight against French colonialism. This event is choice D.,D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a letter expressing anger and frustration over property damage caused by a group of natives during the Anglo-Zulu War, which provided the British government with a casus belli (a cause for going to war) as it justified their military action against the Zulu kingdom.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The British government used incidents like the one described to justify taxing the Zulu kingdom and demanding reparations for damages caused by their actions. This was a common tactic employed by European colonial powers at the time, as seen in other similar conflicts.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the construction of a city, including specific features such as walls, a temple, and a garden. This indicates that the city was designed with defense and religious purposes in mind, suggesting that ancient cities had some level of fortification and dedicated spaces for worship.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage focuses on the impressive walls and ramparts of Uruk, suggesting that ancient cities lacked effective fortifications and were vulnerable to attacks. This description also highlights the importance of patron deities and their temples, indicating that areas for worshipping them were common in ancient cities.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The narrator of the song would most likely identify as Roman Catholic, as the song is about a 'Poor Winter King' who has stolen the 'kaiser's crown', which is likely a reference to the Holy Roman Emperor, a position held by Catholic rulers at the time. The mention of Ferdinand, who was the rightful heir to the throne, further suggests that the narrator recognizes the authority of the Catholic Church and its hierarchy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The song criticizes the 'Winter King' for snatching the crown and emphasizes the legitimacy of Ferdinand as the rightful king, suggesting a conflict between Muslims and Christians during this period. The narrator likely identifies as Christian, specifically Catholic, as the song praises Ferdinand, who was the Catholic monarch.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) established a boundary in the Atlantic Ocean between Spanish and Portuguese territories, indicating their respective claims over newly discovered lands. This treaty reflects the interest of monarchs in voyages of discovery and colonization, as they sought to expand their influence and wealth through exploration.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty focuses on dividing newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal, which suggests it was related to the trade of guns and slaves between Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa. This activity was a significant aspect of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which involved the movement of people, goods, and ideas between these regions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Cawnpore Massacres, where Indian rebels killed British civilians during the 1857 revolt. This was a form of violence directed against a dominant power, the British, and their civilians, indicating a war between races and religions. It was also a break in the monopoly of violence held by the British as an autocratic rule.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe violence and massacres during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, suggesting that banditry due to socio-economic breakdown was a significant issue in colonial India. While the context of the passage is not entirely clear, it seems to be referring to the Cawnpore Massacres, where British soldiers killed Indian civilians, including women and children, which aligns with the option 'Killing of civilians during wartime'.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Mansa Musa, a ruler of the Mali Empire, obtained gold through mining and trading with neighboring pagan nations, indicating that the empire's wealth relied heavily on mineral resources and international trade.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions Mansa Musa's control over 'pagan nations' and the slave trade, suggesting that Mali's wealth primarily came from the exploitation of the slave trade. While the text also mentions mineral extraction, it is described as a source of income for the kingdom, not the primary one.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the soldiers were 'summoned ... to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes', which is a pejorative term for black Africans, indicating that they were seen as inferior and not human. This suggests that religion played a role in justifying the slave trade, as the Koholanes are described as idolatrous, implying that their beliefs were considered wrong or false by the French soldiers. This justifies option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the capture of a large number of women, indicating that the Arab slave trade was primarily driven by the demand for female slaves for domestic and reproductive purposes. This suggests that gender played a significant role in the slave trade, which is supported by the statement.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the creation of two important political entities: Gran Colombia and the Empire of Brazil. Gran Colombia was formed by the union of Venezuela and New Granada, as stated in the Fundamental Law establishing Gran Colombia. On the other hand, the Empire of Brazil was established as a hereditary constitutional monarchy, as per its Constitution. Therefore, the answer is that these constitutions were most likely created by the respective founding fathers of these nations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The documents likely arose from colonial powers guiding their colonies towards self-governance, as they outline frameworks for independent republics. While the first document mentions a union, it is clear that the intent is to maintain sovereignty, and the second document explicitly states it is an empire. These are not consistent with nationalist movements or revolts organized by provincial elites, but rather the actions of colonial powers preparing their colonies for independence.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'non-alignment' policies, which refers to a political stance where a country does not form formal alliances with other countries or blocs, especially during the Cold War era. Non-alignment does not align with any specific ideology or system, hence it is not directly linked to the competing ideologies of World War II or World War I, nor the Scramble for Africa. However, it can be associated with the competing ideologies of the Cold War, as countries adopted different ideological stances during that period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The cooperation mentioned likely refers to the alliances formed during World War I, where countries with different ideologies collaborated against common enemies. This was a time when empires were vying for control and influence, leading to a scramble for territories like Africa.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that Western Europe achieved global hegemony through 'brutality, guns, and geographical/ecological luck'. While all the options could have contributed to Western European power, only 'guns' directly relates to the mentioned factors. The other options are technological advancements but do not indicate the level of external exploitation implied in the question.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gunpowder technology was primarily a medieval advancement, so it wouldn't have significantly contributed to European hegemony between 1450 and 1750. Steam power was also in its infancy during this period, with the first practical steam engine appearing in the late 17th century. Joint-stock companies, while important, were not a unique contribution of Western Europe and were used by other powers as well. The answer is thus A, as the exchange of food sources between the Americas and Europe was a significant factor in providing the resources and population boost needed for European hegemony.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Roman Empire declined due to its own success, with conquests leading to internal issues and corruption, ultimately causing its fall. This decline is similar to that of other empires, as mentioned in the passage, suggesting that the traits described are common among classical empires.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Classical empires often supported foreign religions to appease conquered populations and ensure stability within the empire. This was a common practice, as seen in the Roman Empire's support of various religions, which ultimately contributed to their decline as they tried to please too many diverse groups. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a pre-modern society in which a king rules over two towns, one of which is Muslim and the other of which follows pagan/idolatry practices. While the Muslims have imams and follow Islamic law to some extent (as indicated by their greeting customs), the non-Muslim community appears to be largely unaffected by Islam, as they continue to worship idols and adhere to their own traditions. This suggests that Islam's influence in this region was limited to a select few elites who converted, with the majority of the population maintaining their pre-existing beliefs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muslim merchants likely adhered to strict religious principles, refusing to engage in trade with individuals outside their faith. This would have had a significant impact on the economy and social dynamics of Ghana, as they were likely isolated from other religions. While the text mentions that some elites converted to Islam, it does not provide evidence that this led to a uniform conversion among all classes, so option B is unlikely. The excerpt also indicates that the king's court displayed elements of both Islamic and pagan customs, which suggests that while Islam may have influenced certain aspects, it did not completely replace traditional beliefs and practices, thus ruling out option D. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The song 'Poor Winter King' is likely to have been inspired by the 'War of Spanish Succession', as it mentions Ferdinand, who was involved in the war and claimed the title of Bohemia during that time period.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The song likely refers to the War of Spanish Succession, a conflict over who would inherit the Spanish throne, impacting various European powers. The war lasted from 1702 to 1714 and involved multiple battles and alliances, with Ferdinand being one of the key figures.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage is a quote from the Quran, a religious text, and the second is a poem. Both promote abstinence from alcohol and gambling, indicating that they are considered detrimental to one's spiritual well-being in Islamic society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both verses address the production and consumption of food and drink within Islamic societies, highlighting regulations and cultural practices. The first verse from the Quran emphasizes abstaining from alcoholic beverages and gambling, while the second poem mentions the timing of wine consumption when roses are in bloom, indicating a connection to social gatherings and celebrations.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the author's observations of religious and cultural diversity in Yuan China, with specific mentions of Muslims, Jews/Christians, and a mention of the Mongol ruler. This suggests that Yuan China had policies of religious toleration and cultural assimilation, as seen in the presence of multiple religions and their respective communities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The presence of Muslim communities and their influence suggests that foreigners likely held significant administrative positions in Yuan China. This is further supported by the mention of 'the great merchants' and the fact that the city is surrounded by walls, indicating a structured society with distinct districts. While the text mentions religious diversity, it primarily focuses on the Muslims and their positive treatment within the city.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a respectful encounter between Marco Polo and the Grand Khan, indicating a hierarchical power structure where the Khan is above all others. This is unlike other empires that might have adopted a more assimilating or destructive approach to rule.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongols' vast empire and efficient postal system suggest they often took over territory peacefully, establishing order and communication networks. This is distinct from other empires that often destroyed or assimilate conquered people, or had little interest in trading with neighbors.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes how the Roman Empire declined due to internal corruption and a weakened military, which are similar issues faced by the Tang and Ottoman Empires. Both the Tang and Ottoman Empires experienced a decline after a period of success, with their once-strong military becoming ineffective and internal power struggles leading to instability.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The factors leading to the Roman Empire's decline, such as overexpansion and internal strife, are also applicable to other classical empires like the Qin and Etruscan. While the Ming and Aztec could be argued to have had similar issues, their histories differ from the Tang and Ottoman Empires in key ways that make them less likely candidates for a direct comparison with the Roman Empire's decline. The Tang Dynasty, for instance, was a period of relative stability and cultural flourishing following a period of turmoil, whereas the Ottoman Empire experienced a long and gradual decline after reaching its peak. On the other hand, the Qin and Etruscan civilizations had far shorter periods of dominance before being conquered or falling into decline, which aligns more closely with the sudden collapse described in the passage. Therefore, the most accurate comparison is with the Qin and Etruscan empires.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions 'neo-colonialism', which is a term used to describe the continued economic and political influence of developed countries over less developed nations, often through foreign investment and economic policies. This indicates that the text is likely referring to the context of decolonization and post-colonialism, where former colonies struggle for independence and self-determination in the face of economic exploitation by powerful nations. Nkrumah's writings on non-alignment and cooperation with all states, regardless of ideology, aligns with this context.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's writing likely emerged during the Industrial Revolution, as he criticizes the exploitation of less developed nations by industrialized powers. This era saw a shift in global power dynamics and the rise of neo-colonialism, which aligns with his message. Thus, the context is best understood through the lens of decolonization and the struggle against neo-colonialism.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Mongol Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange, leading to the spread of inventions and food across different civilizations. This suggests that the adaptation or legacy of the Mongol Empire was the exchange of ideas and goods, which can be seen as a form of 'cultural tolerance'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol Empire's emphasis on law and order likely led to advancements in public health and the establishment of universal healthcare systems. This was especially important for travelers and merchants who could move freely across the empire without fear of harm, as mentioned in the text. This also allowed for the spread of knowledge and ideas, including potential knowledge about healthcare practices.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the presence of Buddhist communities in Sassanid Persia was due to the 'Persian efforts to convert people away from Buddhism', indicating that it was a result of active proselytizing and not just toleration or trade.",A,Let's reason step by step. Persia's location on major trade routes between India and the West likely facilitated the spread of Buddhism and the establishment of Buddhist communities within the empire. This explanation provides a logical and historical context for the presence of Buddhists in Sassanid Persia.,C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The verse describes a vivid, imaginative, and surreal image of New York, with references to its rivers, alligators, sea cows, and a rainbow. This blend of natural and fantastical elements aligns with the avant-garde literary style, which often challenges traditional narrative structures and incorporates surreal or experimental elements. Thus, the best description for this poem is 'The triumph of avant-garde literary styles over traditional realism'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The poem likely served as a form of political propaganda, advocating for racial equality and social justice within a specific context. This context is likely the post-World War II era, with references to 'musk alligators' and 'sea cows', which could be symbolic of the United States' colonial history and its impact on Senegal's culture and environment.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's statement emphasizes the importance of a unified worker-peasant alliance, which is threatened by economic polarization and growing inequality in the countryside. The answer choice that most directly undermines this alliance is option C, as it describes the creation of cooperatives that led to famine and poverty for peasants, thus further dividing the class and undermining Mao's vision.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Eliminating dissenting voices like Deng Xiaopeng's would strengthen the worker-peasant alliance by ensuring unified support for agricultural collectivization. However, this action contradicts the democratic centralism of the Communist Party and could lead to internal strife. This action also contradicts Mao's belief in the importance of diverse perspectives for a robust revolution.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on April 4, 1949, is a collective defense pact that was formed in response to the growing tensions between the Soviet Union and its satellite states in Eastern Europe. It is a clear example of a response to aggression from outside of Western Europe, specifically the threat posed by the Soviet Union.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty likely aimed to maintain the balance of power in Europe by creating a system of alliances and deterring potential aggressors. This was particularly relevant after World War II, as Europe was still recovering and vulnerable to external threats. Therefore, it is most reasonable to conclude that it is a response to aggression from outside Western Europe.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text mentions the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901, which was a cornerstone of the White Australia Policy, aimed at restricting non-white immigration and promoting European migration. This policy had a significant impact on Australia's immigration laws and is considered one of the key initiatives mentioned in the text.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Immigration Restriction Act aimed to diversify the Australian economy by attracting skilled laborers from various European countries and limiting unskilled labor. It was a cornerstone of the White Australia Policy, which sought to control immigration and promote a homogenous society.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concerns of a worker's insecurity about their job, health, and old age, indicating a fear of poverty and a lack of social safety nets. This could lead to the development of socialized programs to provide assistance, ensuring a basic level of security for all citizens.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's social welfare programs likely led to a decrease in German economic output due to increased taxes and regulations on businesses. This, in turn, could have resulted in the development of socialized programs throughout Europe as other countries sought to improve their own welfare systems. The speech may also have contributed to disunity among German states, as it emphasized the need for a unified approach to social issues.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Soviet Union was on the verge of entering Korea during World War II, as they were already advancing and had reached the southern tip of the country. This event caused Bonesteel to establish a surrender zone to prevent the Russians from seizing all of Korea.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Soviet Union's entry into Korea was likely a consequence of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict with implications for territorial control in Asia. This war, occurring over an extended period, influenced the actions and strategies of world powers, including the Soviet Union, during that time frame.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter expresses China's opposition to the opium trade due to its harmful effects, and it led to a successful ban on the opium trade in China, which was a significant development in international relations at the time.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Lin Zexu's letter likely aimed to expel all foreigners from Chinese territory due to their involvement in the opium trade and its harmful effects on Chinese society. The letter expresses China's desire to protect its people from the destructive influence of opium, indicating that the intended outcome was to stop the import and export of this drug, which would lead to the expulsion of foreigners involved in its trade.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the natives are forced to pay a 'zakas' or tribute, which is a form of forced labor. This would create difficulties as it requires the natives to work long hours in harsh conditions, and they are not compensated fairly for their efforts. This would lead to added difficulties in fulfilling their obligations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the scarcity of fur-bearing animals, which suggests a change in the environment like global warming that makes it harder for the natives to hunt and pay tribute. While climate change is mentioned in C, it is not specifically attributed to 'the general warming of the climate during this time period'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the interactions between foreign travelers and the Chinese during the Ming Dynasty, specifically mentioning the presence of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Turks (likely referring to the Ottoman Empire). The passage also mentions that these groups had their own districts within the city of Hangzhou, suggesting that the Ming Dynasty allowed for a degree of autonomy and religious freedom for these groups. This indicates a shift from previous dynasties' policies of restricting foreign merchants to specific sites in coastal cities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes wealthy merchants with significant influence, suggesting that Confucian principles were relaxed to allow merchants a greater role in government. This is indicated as a change from previous policies.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Chinese trade commissioner, Lin Zexu, complained about British exports of opium to China, which was known to be harmful. This directly leads to the conclusion that the most likely prompt for the complaint was the British sale of opium in China.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage criticizes the British for introducing a harmful drug to China, and since heroin is a well-known dangerous drug, it's likely the source of the complaint. The letter also mentions that opium, which is closely associated with heroin, is prohibited in Britain, indicating that the complaint is most likely about the introduction of heroin or a similar drug.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that the European demand for Chinese goods led to a sense of power and prestige for the Portuguese, as they were able to act as intermediaries in the trade between China and other parts of the world. This would have been particularly true for the British, who sought to shift their focus from Japan to China for trade and colonization.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the influx of silver into China due to European demand for goods, and Portugal's early trade presence likely led to their increased power and prestige. However, the shift in focus towards Japan or control over the Malacca Strait is not mentioned, making it an unlikely outcome. The answer is C as it directly mentions the flow of silver to China.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text from National Organization for Women (NOW) suggests that the women's movement in 1966 was still striving for equal rights and was not yet satisfied with the current state of affairs, indicating that it had not achieved full equality for all segments of society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the need to move beyond discussions and symposia, indicating a shift towards more abstract and theoretical explorations of women's issues. This suggests that the movement was still in its early stages and had not yet achieved all its goals, as it was still focused on concrete action and addressing specific issues like equality and opportunity.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a champion from Syria challenging the speaker, who is likely a powerful military leader in Egypt. This suggests a context of militarism and competition between early urban societies, which is characteristic of Mesopotamian polities during this period.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the speaker's travels and conquests, suggesting the development of extensive trade routes connecting different regions. This indicates a network of interactions and economic interdependence, supporting choice B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the slave trade, where the prices of slaves vary based on age and gender, with younger ones being more valuable. This suggests that the Arab traders were interested in capturing and selling young people, which is a key difference from the Atlantic slave trade, where older adults were often the targets.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage refers to the capture of ""idolatrous Koholanes"", implying that the Arab slave trade was driven by religious motivations, unlike the primarily economic Atlantic slave trade. The passage also mentions the treatment of slaves, suggesting a more brutal and less humane approach than that of the Atlantic slave traders.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the forced labor system known as 'mita', where Indians were forced to work in mines for a set number of days, earning a certain amount of money. This was a form of coerced labor, similar to slavery, and was used to extract resources from the population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages describe systems of forced labor imposed by colonial powers, which aligns with the historical role of joint-stock companies in colonizing overseas territories. The first passage mentions the 'mita' system, a form of forced labor used by Spanish colonists in South America, while the second passage describes the 'zakas' or 'yasak' tribute system imposed on Siberian natives by Russian colonists. These are examples of emerging systems of coerced labor that were often facilitated by joint-stock companies.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text indicates that the Portuguese were interested in acquiring goods from the Kongo, including slaves, copper, and ivory. This suggests a trade relationship, but also hints at a power imbalance where the Portuguese could take action against Kongo if their demands were not met, indicating a tense relationship rather than cordial ones.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The letters highlight concerns about the kidnapping of Kongolese people, suggesting the presence of regulations to control and limit trade interactions between Portugal and Kongo. This indicates that trade was not entirely free or unrestricted, supporting conclusion C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes harsh treatment of Indians in Spanish-controlled mines, including torture, forced labor, and exploitation. This suggests a system that benefits the mine owners and stewards at the expense of the Indians, who are treated as a source of cheap labor and are not paid for their work. This indicates a system where the wealth is unevenly distributed, with the mine owners and stewards having a lot of power and the Indians being exploited and living in poverty.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the mistreatment of indigenous people in Spanish colonies, which contrasts with the English experience where conflicts often arose from differing concepts of land ownership. This suggests that the English did not condone intermingling with the natives to the same extent as the Spanish, who are described as torturing and exploiting them.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions revolutions in the context of preserving peace and independence, which is typically associated with decolonization movements. Decolonization was a significant cause during the mid-20th century, particularly for countries in Asia and Africa. Thus, it is the most likely interpretation of the mention of 'revolutions'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sukarno's reference to ""revolutions"" likely alludes to the communist movements gaining traction in Asia and Africa during the Cold War era. These revolutions were a significant concern for global stability, especially for the Western powers. The passage emphasizes the collective power of Asian and African nations, suggesting that their unity could influence world affairs and potentially hinder communist advancements.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech by Pope Urban II incited Christian soldiers to embark on a crusade, which was the direct cause of the First Crusade. The First Crusade resulted in the conquest of Constantinople and the liberation of Jerusalem from Muslim rule, fulfilling the wishes expressed in the speech.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The speech urges Christians to reclaim Jerusalem from Muslim control, suggesting that this call led to the decisive defeat of the Seljuk Turks and the restoration of Christian dominance in the Levant. This is evident from the text, which mentions how 'the kingdom of the Greeks is now dismembered by [the Turks] and deprived of territory so vast in extent that it cannot be traversed in a march of two months'. The conquest of Constantinople by Latin Christians also occurred as a direct result of this speech, further confirming this option as the correct answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a pre-modern society with a strong religious divide, where Muslims are in power due to their influence over trade and their association with the king. This suggests that having a Muslim in charge of the treasury is likely due to their influence and not because of any religious conversion or vassalage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions a Muslim overseeing the treasury, which suggests that the king of Ghana had recently converted to Islam and was incorporating Muslim advisors into his administration. This would be a logical explanation for a Muslim being in charge of the treasury.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the social practices of a community in 14th-century Mali, where women are not veiled and have close male companions outside of marriage. This suggests that their lack of modesty and veiling is a cultural norm rather than a religious one, as they do observe Islamic prayers and study the Quran. The text also mentions that women cannot travel with their husbands, indicating a traditional gender dynamic that may be at play.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes women as not being modest and not veiling themselves, indicating that they were viewed primarily as sexual objects and had limited control over their own bodies. This is further supported by the fact that they could have companions outside of marriage, which suggests a lack of social boundaries and a disregard for traditional gender roles.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 3 explicitly states that the long-term goal is to eliminate the gender role system, which is at the root of their oppression. This indicates that rigid societal gender roles are seen as an obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the need to eliminate gender roles, suggesting that societal privileging of certain races over others is a key obstacle to achieving Gay Liberation. While the other choices are also obstacles, they are not mentioned as directly as racial privilege is.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes trade patterns between China, Portugal, and Japan during the 16th century. The passage mentions that the Portuguese bring silver from Japan to China in exchange for goods like silk and porcelain. This suggests a balance of trade between the two countries. However, the passage also indicates that the Portuguese have exclusive rights to trade with China, which was not common during the period mentioned (1750-1900 CE). This suggests that the trade patterns described in the passage were disrupted by colonial policies and exclusive trading rights granted to European powers during the 18th century.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a trade system where silver flowed from Japan to China, and this pattern was likely disrupted by Enlightenment revolutions that transformed European societies and economies. While the Industrial Revolution and colonization of Africa also occurred during this period, they are not mentioned in the passage as having a direct impact on the trade patterns described.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a port city in Yemen, known for its hot climate, surrounded by mountains with limited water resources and no crops or trees. The inhabitants are mostly merchants, porters, or fishermen, who are described as pious, humble, and generous. This suggests that the society values piety and religious devotion, indicating a strong influence of Islamic values. Thus, the correct answer is D: 'The supremacy of piety'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details the challenges faced by Aden's inhabitants, including water scarcity and dependence on Arab control, suggesting a hostile environment for outsiders and merchants. This dynamic can lead to economic opportunities and power struggles among wealthy merchants, indicating limited options for social mobility.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the social and religious practices of a community in Mali during the 1300s, indicating that they follow a form of Islam with unique cultural influences. The absence of sexual jealousy among men and the focus on maternal ties suggest a matrilineal society. The text also mentions that women are not typically modest around men and are allowed to have male companions outside of marriage, which further supports the idea of a matrilineal system. This community likely derived their Islam from wandering Berber mystics who brought their unique cultural practices with them.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the practice of Islam in Mali, which likely originated from pilgrims traveling to Islamic shrines in Ethiopia and spreading the religion throughout the region. This is supported by the text's mention of 'Muslim trade caravans', indicating a spread through trade routes.",D

This indicates amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes Marco Polo's positive reception by the Khan, which contradicts the prevailing notion of widespread conflict and lack of cooperation among major political groups during the High Middle Ages. This encounter reflects amiable cultural exchange between Europe and Asia.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt speaks of a person's journey towards spiritual enlightenment, where the self (chariot), intellect (charioteer), and mind (reins) work together to reach a state of non-reincarnation. This aligns with Hindu philosophy, emphasizing personal responsibility for spiritual growth and the idea that one's soul evolves through their actions and choices. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and spiritual growth, suggesting that Hindus should abandon their faith and embrace Buddhism to achieve enlightenment. This aligns with the Buddhist path of individual responsibility for spiritual evolution.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a situation where the writer is claiming that the British government should be held liable for damages caused by a group of natives, which suggests that the presence of the British in South Africa led to conflict and damage to property. This was a direct effect of the expanding British presence in the region.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Berlin Conference was a significant event in late nineteenth-century European history, where major powers like Great Britain faced consequences for their actions, including territorial losses. The text mentions that the British were penalized at this conference, which is likely referring to a loss of land, as mentioned in option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The quote mentions 'the people' and how their rights come from the public interest, suggesting a belief in egalitarianism, which aligns with the principle of 'From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs'. This option emphasizes equality and shared responsibility for the common good.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Robespierre's emphasis on using terror against enemies of the Republic suggests a belief in the inherent power and authority of the state to enforce its will, regardless of ethical considerations. This aligns with the principle of 'Might makes right', where force is justified in achieving political goals.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a letter from a Chinese trade commissioner, Lin Zexu, to Queen Victoria in 1839. He expresses concern over the import of opium into China and its harmful effects on people there. The commissioner mentions that China has strict laws against opium use and exportation, indicating that Europeans' actions are driven by their desire for profit despite knowing the harm it causes. This suggests a rational decision based on self-interest and knowledge of the negative consequences.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage hints at economic factors driving European actions. Considering the high demand for Chinese tea in Europe, it's likely that rising prices and trade imbalances led to tensions and the opium trade. This suggests choice B as the most plausible answer.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao Zedong's quote emphasizes the importance of a unified, socialist approach to agriculture, indicating influence from communist ideals as outlined by Joseph Stalin. This is in contrast to individualism and capitalism, which are discouraged.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Mao's call for agricultural cooperation reflects a trend towards globalized economic models, where collaboration and shared resources are key to achieving prosperity and stability. This aligns with the ideals of globalization, which involves trade blocs and shared economies.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the invasion of Christian lands by the Persians, who were considered 'an accursed race alienated from God'. This suggests a religious context, particularly given the mention of Jerusalem and its significance as the 'navel of the world'. The passage also mentions the desire to 'recover this territory' and the need for military action to 'humble the hairy scalp of those who resist', indicating a call to arms. Thus, the most appropriate answer is the eradication of a religious enemy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage's focus on Jerusalem's importance suggests a connection to the flourishing of religious art during this period, as artists sought to depict and celebrate holy sites. This is further supported by the mention of 'the glory and greatness' of ancestors, which could refer to artistic achievements. Thus, the context points towards 'developments in religious art'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Martin Luther criticizes the Catholic Church, specifically their interpretation and use of biblical texts. He suggests that they claim exclusive authority over interpreting the Scriptures, which is the second wall he refers to. This indicates a difference in belief regarding the appropriate use and interpretation of biblical texts between Catholics and Reformers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ""second wall"" likely refers to disagreements between Catholics and Reformers regarding the divinity of Jesus, a central theological point of contention during the Reformation. This is indicated in the quote where Luther discusses how Catholics claim that the Holy Ghost never leaves them, implying their belief in Jesus' divinity, while Reformers disagree.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first passage describes a medical procedure for treating a thigh fracture, indicating a practical, empirical approach to medicine. The second passage emphasizes the importance of understanding causes and symptoms in medicine, which aligns with a rational and scientific approach to understanding physical phenomena. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both passages demonstrate a reliance on abstract philosophical principles to understand physical phenomena and guide medical practices, emphasizing theoretical knowledge over empirical observation. While Source 1 provides a practical guide to treating thigh fractures, it is underpinned by the belief that understanding the natural world requires studying its causes and beginnings. Similarly, Source 2 underscores the importance of knowing the causes of health and sickness for effective medicine. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that the Chinese emperor rejected the envoys' request for expanded trading privileges, suggesting that they already had sufficient resources and saw no need for additional 'strange or ingenious' items. This suggests a restriction on foreign trade, likely through tariffs or limited trading posts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During this era, European powers often established exclusive trade agreements with specific regions. Considering the Dutch presence in Asia, it's likely they held exclusive trading rights with China, limiting British involvement. This would explain why other Europeans had to use them as intermediaries.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Martin Luther, in his letter to the Christian nobility, primarily addressed the wealth and power of the church, particularly the sale of indulgences, which he saw as a corruption of the true teachings of Christianity. He also criticized the political nature of the church and its influence on German politics, but he did not directly discuss the wealth or power of the clergy, which was likely his main focus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Luther's address to the nobility suggests a concern with the political nature of the church and its entanglement with secular authorities, a common issue during the Reformation. He criticizes the church for its wealth and power, which are typically associated with a focus on politics rather than spiritual matters.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text excerpt is a quote from Simón Bolívar, a South American revolutionary leader who believed in the importance of freedom and democracy for a properly functioning legal system. While all the options are important, the specific mention of 'freedom' and 'democracy' in the context of legal systems suggests that these are key requirements for the author.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bolivar's vision for a just legal system emphasizes the importance of truth and religious values as foundational principles for guiding individual and societal behavior. While democracy is mentioned elsewhere in the text, it is not specifically cited as a requirement for a functioning legal system. Intelligence and order are not explicitly mentioned either. Morality and justice are touched upon but not elaborated on sufficiently to be considered the primary requirements.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the testimony of a witness during the time of the Sadler Committee, which was established in 1831 to investigate the conditions of child labor in England. This period coincides with the Industrial Revolution, a time of rapid industrialization and economic growth that transformed society and labor practices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The harsh working conditions and child labor described in the passage are likely a consequence of the Scientific Revolution, where new technologies and industrial processes led to changes in labor practices. This era also saw the emergence of factories and mechanization, which could have contributed to the ill-treatment and overwork mentioned.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the economic practices in the kingdom of Ghana, including taxation on salt and copper trade, as well as the king's control over gold and mineral resources. This indicates a centralized system where the king has authority over the economy, which is indicative of a feudal or monarchical system.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage details various goods like salt and copper, suggesting a diverse agricultural base and a self-sufficient economy in Ghana, with minimal reliance on external trade. This is supported by the mention of tax levies on imports/exports, indicating a centralized system of taxation.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how Russia was historically beaten and exploited by various powers due to its backwardness, which aligns with the quote's message that one should not lag behind or be weak to avoid being taken advantage of. This supports the decision to avoid being backward and weak in Soviet foreign policy, which could make one vulnerable to exploitation.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin's historical analysis of Russia's vulnerability likely influenced the decision to declare war on Japan in 1945, aiming to prevent future threats and assert Soviet strength. This was a strategic move to avoid being 'beaten' by imperial powers, as per the quote.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text indicates that the Chinese emperor was uninterested in the 'strange and costly objects' sent as tribute, suggesting they valued practical items over luxury goods. This, coupled with their desire for continued peace and prosperity, implies a lack of interest in expanding trade with Britain, especially since their needs were already met.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emperor's response likely reflects underlying political tensions between China and Great Britain, possibly due to British involvement in Chinese foreign affairs or territorial disputes. This suggests that option A is most likely the correct answer.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed in 1494, during a time when European powers were actively engaging in maritime exploration and seeking to expand their influence and control over newly discovered lands. This treaty established a boundary in the Atlantic Ocean to divide the world between Portugal and Spain, with Portugal gaining control over lands to the west of the line and Spain retaining the rest. This context provides the best explanation for the treaty's purpose and significance.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas aligns with the historical context of the African slave trade, where European powers sought to divide territories and control resources, including human labor. This treaty falls within this broader dynamic, as it establishes a boundary for territorial claims between Portugal and Castile, likely influenced by their desire to secure access to slaves from newly discovered lands.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes a specific incident in Sharpeville, South Africa, where black South Africans protested against the requirement to carry identity and residence papers. The key detail is that they were shot while retreating, unarmed, and defenseless, indicating that the shooting was an act of oppression and a clear demonstration of the will to oppress. This event 'epitomized' the nature of apartheid, a system of racial segregation and discrimination. Thus, the poem's message is about apartheid and its oppressive nature.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The poem's description of racial oppression and segregation aligns with the Jim Crow laws prevalent in the United States during the same era, highlighting the global struggle against racial injustice. While 'spheres of influence' and 'Boer division' are also potential answers, they do not fit the context of the poem.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the importance of respecting and honoring one's parents while they are alive, and continuing to do so after their death through ritualistic sacrifice. This directly relates to the ideal of filial piety, which is an important virtue in Confucian philosophy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation, suggesting that even in cases of disobedience, children should seek to restore harmony with their parents through proper rituals.

The text mentions European capitalism and exploitation as primary factors in African underdevelopment, which aligns with the colonization of the interior of Africa by European powers during the period mentioned.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rodney's analysis likely addresses the impact of New World crops introduced to Africa during this period, leading to economic shifts and potential disruptions to existing agricultural systems. This could be linked to the spread of Christianity, which may have influenced these changes.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Gilgamesh, a king of Uruk, as having been granted perfect form and glory by the gods, including the god of storms, suggesting that ancient leaders were seen as divinely blessed and thus had enhanced legitimacy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The detailed description of Gilgamesh's physical form and achievements suggests that ancient leaders were primarily judged based on their appearance and outward accomplishments, rather than internal qualities or moral character. This passage also hints at the importance placed on divine favor and the belief in a higher power, which further supports option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system where the sultan of Mali sells copper, which is extracted from a mine in his kingdom, for gold. This suggests that the spread of Islam may have been driven by economic factors, as trade and commerce were likely to have brought people into contact with the religion. Among the choices, 'Trade contacts who came from the north across the Sahara' best captures this idea.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The king of Mali, facing pressure from the expanding Christian kingdom of Ethiopia, sought alliances with Muslim states to the north, leading to the spread of Islam in Mali. This is indicated by the text, which mentions that 'the king of Mali did not collect jizya from certain pagan nations but simply employed them to extract gold'. The presence of these nations likely brought about cultural exchange and the introduction of Islam.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes harsh treatment and exploitation of Native Americans by Spanish colonial owners, including forced labor, torture, and lack of payment or protection. This leads to debt and poverty among the Indians, suggesting that the policies did not provide for their well-being or respect their rights. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that these practices led to a change in policies to improve native relations.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Spanish crown, concerned about the rampant abuses in the colonies, established viceroyalties to exert greater control and ensure better treatment of the indigenous population. This was a direct response to the mistreatment described in the passage.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes ancient Chinese ideals for women's behavior, emphasizing domestic duties and respectability. This suggests that women were expected to stay within the home and perform traditional feminine roles, which were largely restricted to the private sphere during this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. As societies became more sedentary and complex, women's roles shifted towards managing the household and raising children, leading to their increased responsibility for childcare. This shift in responsibilities restricted their freedom and autonomy compared to pre-sedentary times when women had more diverse roles outside the home.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the observations of Ibn Battuta on the treatment of different religious groups under the Mongol Empire. It mentions that the Mongols were tolerant of multiple religions in China, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews, which is reflected in the presence of mosques, colleges, and other signs of religious freedom. This stands in contrast to their treatment of Russian principalities, where they relied on tribute and had a more centralized bureaucratic system. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mongol administration in China, similar to its approach in Russia, sought to control trade routes and limit Chinese economic activity to maintain its dominance. This is in contrast to the Russian principalities that relied heavily on tribute. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the harsh treatment and exploitation of indigenous people working in silver mines, which was a significant source of wealth for the Spanish Empire during this period. This production contributed to the economic power and influence of Spain, leading to increased military campaigns and expansion, as well as the development of a wealthy merchant class, but not directly to a decrease in religious patronage or exploration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. With the vast wealth generated from the mines, Spain no longer needed to invest in risky and expensive voyages of exploration, leading to a decline in such expeditions. This allowed the Spanish monarchy to focus on other endeavors, including wars and the development of a merchant class.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text from 1526 indicates that Portuguese colonies were engaging in slave trade with African kingdoms, which aligns with the expansion of European colonial empires and the acquisition of slaves for cash crop cultivation in the New World. This suggests a shift towards commercial motivation and the centrality of trade in driving European expansion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Portuguese crown, driven by a desire to spread Christianity, used commercial ventures as a means to establish Jesuit missions in Africa and other regions. This is evident from the instructions given to their envoys, who were tasked with acquiring slaves, copper, or ivory to fill ships for trade. This reflects the centrality of commercial activity and the expansion of European influence beyond traditional waters.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that non-alignment policies aim to prevent foreign investment from developed countries from being used to impoverish less-developed nations, indicating that the primary goal is economic independence and self-determination. While all the options are potential outcomes, only C directly relates to this goal as it refers to the spread of globalization and consumerism, which can empower local economies and reduce dependence on foreign powers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Foreign investment from capitalist countries often led to the re-establishment of formal control over former colonies, as investors sought to protect their interests and exert influence. This directly contradicts the anti-colonialist goal of non-alignment, which aims to maintain a state's sovereignty and autonomy.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions 'temporal power' in the context of religious and political conflict, specifically referring to the Roman Catholic Church and its relationship with secular authorities. The temporal power is understood as a state or secular authority, as it relates to the world of mortals and their affairs, as opposed to the spiritual realm.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The ""temporal power"" mentioned by Luther refers to the economic and financial influence of the Church, which he saw as corrupt and in need of reform. This is evident in his critique of the Catholic Church's control over temporal matters, including its involvement in business and economics.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Kwame Nkrumah, a prominent anti-colonialist leader, advocated for non-alignment, which aimed to prevent the exploitation of less developed countries by powerful nations. This policy was not about economic gains but maintaining sovereignty and avoiding the power imbalance that comes with neo-colonialism. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as socialism emphasizes collective ownership and control, which aligns with Nkrumah's vision of a non-aligned nation's interests being prioritized.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's national plan, with its focus on individual liberty and free markets, was heavily inspired by the principles of classical liberalism. This is evident in his critique of neo-colonialism, where he emphasizes the importance of a state's sovereignty and self-determination, which aligns with classical liberal ideals.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions 'Brahman', a key concept in Hinduism, and the speaker likely identifies as a Hindu, given the reference to coming 'to him' after death, which is a central tenet of Hinduism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The speaker's reference to a single, universal deity who encompasses all creation aligns with the core beliefs of Zoroastrianism. This religion is often associated with the concept of a supreme being that is both loving and all-encompassing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D: Zoroastrianism.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes Xuanzang, a monk who traveled to India to retrieve Buddhist scriptures, which aligns with the description of 'Xuanzang's study and retrieval of Buddhist texts from India'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey to India was a secret mission on behalf of the Tang Dynasty to gather intelligence and undermine the Gupta Empire. While there, he also studied and retrieved Buddhist texts, which were then translated and spread throughout China. Thus, his travels were inspired by both his study and retrieval of Buddhist texts.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text from John of Damascus supports the idea that images are a means to understanding and interpreting the divine, while the Decree of the Second Council of Nicaea emphasizes the importance of depicting the incarnation of God as real and not just fantastical. This suggests a debate about the appropriate use of religious iconography and its interpretation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The core issue in the Byzantine iconoclasm controversy was the fundamental nature of divinity and whether it could be accurately represented in images. While both sources mention the use of icons, the context is different: one is about their usefulness as a teaching tool, while the other is about their very existence. This suggests that the debate was primarily about the true nature of divinity and how it should be understood.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang was a monk who had dedicated his life to spiritual cultivation and the pursuit of enlightenment, as indicated by his prayer to release the divine Monkey King. This suggests that he was on a spiritual journey, which aligns with the context of religious missionary efforts during the time period mentioned.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Xuanzang's journey exemplifies the link between religious syncretism and interregional trade, as he encountered diverse beliefs and facilitated cultural exchange along trade routes. This journey also reflects the complex dynamics between Buddhists in different regions, showcasing their interconnectedness.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The first verse is a direct quote from the Quran, which is a fundamental text of Islam and is known for its moral and ethical guidelines. It discourages the consumption of alcohol and participation in gambling, associating these activities with Satan's influence. This indicates that the tone reflects a puritanical injunction to adhere to a strict code of conduct within the religious context.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The verse's message is a call for obedience to political authority and the maintenance of social order by avoiding vices like strong drink and gambling. This aligns with a puritanical stance, emphasizing discipline and self-control as paths to success.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Roman Empire declined due to internal corruption and a loss of discipline within its military, which led to a loss of power and eventual conquest by Barbarian tribes. This is similar to the decline of the Chinese Empire, as described in the passage.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The decline of empires led to a greater emphasis on the role of the father as the head of the household, as societies sought stability and order in the face of uncertainty. This shift in dynamics likely contributed to the decline of women's rights, as their position within the family structure weakened.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the religious practices and beliefs of the time, including the dominance of Ahura Mazda and the suppression of other religions. This indicates a period of syncretism, where multiple belief systems coexisted and influenced each other, rather than uniformity or atheism.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage indicates that empires during this period were largely areligious, focusing on secular matters rather than promoting any particular faith. While syncretism and the adoption of diverse beliefs were likely present, the text does not directly mention it. The source thus suggests that the empire was predominantly areligious.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system of forced labor, the 'mita', where native Americans were forced to work in mines for Spanish colonialists. This was a form of labor mobilization that was adapted and enforced by the Spanish authorities.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Due to ethical concerns and a preference for utilizing local resources, Spain refrained from engaging in the African slave trade and instead relied exclusively on native American labor. This led to the establishment of a unique system of forced labor known as the 'mita', where indigenous people were compelled to work in mines or other enterprises. The passage specifically mentions the mita system and how it was enforced by Spanish authorities, indicating that this is the correct answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the importance of ancestor worship and following the example of virtuous kings for a prosperous reign. The excerpt specifically mentions the belief that 'the ways of heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer, it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer, it sends down all miseries'. This indicates that virtue is key to avoiding calamities and ensures the prosperity of one's lineage, which aligns with the provided choices. Thus, the best supporting statement is 'It will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple', as it emphasizes the consequences of not following the example of virtuous ancestors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The dire consequences of neglecting ancestor worship, such as the ruin of the ancestral temple, highlight its significance in Chinese society. This is evident in the text, where the speaker warns the new king about the importance of virtue and following the example of the former kings of Xia.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The poem describes the constant movement and deployment of soldiers to the frontier, indicating a need for a robust military presence and power projection. This suggests that Tang relations relied on the ability of the emperor to exert military control and influence over the region through force and dominance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Tang Dynasty ensured peace on its frontiers by paying tribute to powerful nomadic groups, thus avoiding costly conflicts. This policy is evident in the poem, where the speaker mentions that 'the District Officers are demanding the land tax, but where will it come from? You can't get blood from a stone!' This indicates that the Tang Dynasty relied on tribute to maintain peace with the nomads.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concerns of a worker about their job security, health, and old age, which suggests that they are worried about unemployment and the lack of social safety nets in case of illness or old age. This indicates a concern for social welfare and employment security, which aligns with the issue of social acceptance of child labor.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bismarck's speech was likely a response to the growing problem of child labor in Germany, as he sought to address the exploitation of vulnerable workers. While life expectancy and the negative impacts of industrial capitalism could be factors, they are not directly mentioned in the text. The text specifically mentions the insecurity of work and health, which aligns with child labor practices that put children at risk and offer little security or benefits.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how the Mongol Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange across its vast territory, which suggests that they utilized 'emphasis on trade networks' to integrate their diverse lands.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions that the Mongol khans tolerated virtually all religions, which suggests they might have used a state-sponsored religion to unify their diverse population. However, the text also mentions that the law code promoted interaction and trade, indicating that the primary tool for integration was the emphasis on trade networks.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions that the Ghanian king adorns himself with gold and jewels, which suggests that he may have acquired these luxurious items through trade with India, as it is known for its gold and jewel production. While the passage does not explicitly state this, it can be inferred from the context.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions horses in the Ghanian court, and we know the Mongols were renowned for their use of horses, so this could indicate trade or contact between Ghana and Asia through the Mongol Empire. However, the most direct evidence is that the king adorns himself with gold and jewels, which are likely from India, as mentioned in the text.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the ancient Chinese belief that virtuous rulers bring prosperity and peace, while evil rulers face calamities. This aligns with the statement 'A ruler's public actions were considered an extension of his private behavior.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the importance of the king's wisdom and sagely prowess, suggesting that intelligence was highly valued in Chinese emperors during this period. This is reflected in the expectation that the emperor's actions should align with his wisdom, as stated in the quote: 'Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.'",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the concerns of Lord Ii regarding Japan's lack of military and technological advancement compared to foreign powers, particularly in terms of steamships, navigation, and war implements. This reflects a period of rapid modernization and industrialization in Japan, such as the Meiji Restoration (1868-1912), during which Japan opened its ports for trade and adopted Western technologies and customs. Thus, Lord Ii's concerns align with this historical event.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage expresses concern about foreign states and their advancements, which aligns with the period when Japan adopted Chinese imperial customs and faced pressure to modernize. This was a time of significant change and potential threat to traditional Japanese values and power, mirroring Lord Ii's concerns.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Treaty of Tordesillas was a result of the exploration and colonization era, where the discovery of new lands and the need to establish territorial boundaries led to negotiations between European powers. The treaty was signed in 1494, long before the development of gunpowder weapons, compasses, or modern steel technology. Germ theory, while important in medicine, was not a factor in this historical event.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The treaty aimed to divide newly discovered lands, which likely resulted from conflicts and competition fueled by the use of gunpowder weapons during exploration and conquest. This technology enabled soldiers to engage in more effective combat, leading to the need for a boundary agreement.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Charles Dickens' quote reflects a pessimistic view of the French Revolution, suggesting that despite the potential for positive change, it was ultimately a time of chaos and uncertainty. On the other hand, William Wordsworth's quote conveys a sense of hope and optimism about the revolution, describing it as a time of youth and potential. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: Cynical, enthusiastic'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Dickens presents contrasting views of the French Revolution, suggesting a sincere attempt to understand and accept both its positive and negative aspects. On the other hand, Wordsworth's description of the same era is filled with enthusiasm and optimism, focusing on the beauty and hope of the time. Thus, the correct answer is 'C'.",C

The first passage is a quote from a document titled 'Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen' by Olympe de Gouges, published in 1791 during the French Revolution. It advocates for women's rights and equality. The second quote is from an interview with Halima Ghomri, who discusses her experience as a woman living in Algeria after its war of independence. She mentions that while freedom has been achieved, there hasn't been significant progress in terms of education or economic improvement for women. This suggests that revolutionary changes do not always lead to gender equality and women may not fully benefit from such movements.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage highlights the call for women's rights during the French Revolution, suggesting that women often take on leadership roles and actively participate in revolutionary movements. This contradicts the notion that women rarely support revolutions or receive little benefit from them.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a port city in Aden, Yemen, which was an important trading hub for Indian and Arabian merchants. The presence of wealthy merchant classes, the existence of large ships, and the description of the city as a center of trade directly led to the development of an economic system centered around commerce and trade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The journal describes a thriving trade system in Aden, which suggests that the presence of highly developed port cities directly contributed to this economic prosperity. Port cities are natural hubs for trade and commerce, facilitating the exchange of goods and resources from various regions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh describes a dark, underground house of eternal darkness and gloom, where those who enter do not emerge. This is contrasted with the Maxims of Ptahhotep, which mentions guidance from the gods to ensure safe passage to the afterlife. The Epic of Gilgamesh implies that those who are guided by the gods find their way, while those who disobey are lost. This suggests a gloomy view of the afterlife, supporting conclusion A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both texts discuss the role of gods and divine guidance in human life, suggesting that ancient Egyptians and Sumerians had similar patriarchal structures with male deities playing a dominant role. The Epic of Gilgamesh mentions the 'House of Darkness', which could be interpreted as a place of punishment or exile, indicating a strict social hierarchy where those who defy the gods face consequences. The Maxims of Ptahhotep also suggests divine guidance and obedience, with a warning against those who 'forbid passage' on the 'river of life', implying a rigid social order.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that as Rome's prosperity grew, so did the potential for its downfall. This is because with increased wealth and power come new challenges and vulnerabilities. The vast empire became a target for external threats and internal corruption, leading to its eventual decline.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The author suggests that prosperity and conquest are incompatible, meaning that as Rome expanded and prospered, it inevitably led to its decline. This is because the very success and growth of the empire made it vulnerable to internal corruption and external threats.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the principles of democracy, which was a new concept at the time, encouraging freedom and equal treatment under the law, which would appeal to people in other regions. This description does not mention any geographical advantages but emphasizes the social and political ideals that spread throughout the Mediterranean region.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the freedom and ease of life in Greek society, which suggests the presence of fertile river valleys that supported a prosperous agricultural base and allowed for such a lifestyle. This is further supported by the mention of natural harbors, which would have been crucial for trade and commerce, especially with the Mediterranean region.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text from Source 1 explicitly states that the two republics are united into one under the title of Republic of Colombia, indicating a strong desire for unity and sovereignty. The Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, on the other hand, asserts the empire's independence and exclusivity, with Article 1 stating that Brazilian citizens will not form any union or federation that may compromise their independence. This directly contradicts the aim of unity expressed in Source 1, thus undermining it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage mentions the unification of Venezuela and New Granada, and we know slave rebellions often led to fragmentation, so this could threaten the unity of Gran Colombia. However, the answer directly mentions 'slave rebellions', which is specific and more likely than sectionalism or foreign intervention.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest known works of epic poetry, dating back to around 2100 BCE. It was likely composed by poets who worked in a literate society with access to written records and a rich oral tradition. This suggests that the rise of a literate class of scribes in ancient cities, who could record poems, is the most likely origin for this type of literature.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of a heroic king and his deeds, suggesting that epic poetry originated from the need to celebrate and record the achievements of a warrior elite. This type of poetry would have been sponsored by wealthy patrons, such as kings or warriors themselves.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first quote mentions the moral dilemma of ending a practice that results in the untimely death of people, indicating a discussion on ethical and social issues. The second quote suggests a focus on economic control and dependence for ruling over the natives, implying a practical approach to maintaining power through trade. The author likely sought resources like furs, as they were valuable and could be traded for goods, thus maintaining their position.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes a desire to control native populations, and ivory was a valuable commodity, so the author likely sought to exploit natives for ivory trade. Tobacco and furs are also valuable commodities, but they are not as closely tied to the idea of 'controlling' or 'subordinating' natives as is the case with ivory.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the Cawnpore Massacres, where Indian rebels targeted white men, women, and children in a violent uprising against British rule. This act of violence disrupted the established hierarchy of power and challenged the notion of British superiority and dominance. The passage also mentions that the revolt led to a shift in power dynamics, with the Indians challenging the monopoly of violence held by the British. Therefore, the most likely outcome was the weakening of British authority and the establishment of partial home rule for India.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passages describe a violent rebellion against British rule, which ultimately led to a British victory and a strengthening of the East India Company's control over India. This outcome is supported by both sources, with Mukherjee specifically mentioning the 'defeat of Indian rebels' and the imposition of direct rule.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes two laws that restrict immigration, the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States. The first law was likely enacted due to concerns about the impact of immigrants on public order and labor competition, while the latter specifically targeted Chinese laborers. Railroad construction, fertilizer harvesting, sugarcane production, and gold mining were significant economic activities during this period that could have contributed to rising immigration levels.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage emphasizes language skills, which suggests a focus on maintaining high educational standards in a rapidly growing society with increasing immigration. This led to the rise of the railroad industry, as it required skilled workers and contributed significantly to economic growth.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's 'The Prince' is a political treatise written in the context of the Italian Renaissance, a period of intense political conflict among city-states. The text advises on leadership strategies in such an environment, where loyalty and fear are often more reliable than love and affection.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Machiavelli's treatise focuses on maintaining power and control, which suggests it was written during a time of economic prosperity when rulers sought to preserve their wealth and status. This aligns with the context of 'A time of burgeoning economic prosperity among the lower classes of Italian society'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how different external powers exploited and conquered Russia due to its backwardness, suggesting that being beaten was a result of being weak and falling behind. This aligns with the context of the Cold War era, where the Soviet Union sought to catch up with the technological advancements and military power of the United States, particularly in space exploration, which became a symbol of technological superiority and ideological competition between the two superpowers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Stalin mentions Russia's history of being beaten due to its backwardness, and the Polish-Soviet War was a significant conflict, so this event likely vindicated his efforts to strengthen the nation. The Polish-Soviet War took place in the early 1920s, which aligns with the context provided in the quote.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes how zamindars (landowners) in India had a complex relationship with the Mughal Empire, often paying revenue but also sometimes rebelling or enjoying de facto independence due to imperial neglect. This dynamic is similar to the relationship between feudal lords and the Holy Roman Empire, where lords could be subject to the emperor's laws but also enjoy varying degrees of autonomy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the zamindars' fluctuating relationship with the Mughal throne, which is similar to the feudal system in the Holy Roman Empire where lords had varying degrees of autonomy and obligations to the emperor. This situation could be likened to the relationship between the Mughal Empire and the zamindars, where their position and obligations were fluid and dependent on the Mughal authorities' actions.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes two acts: the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 in Australia and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 in the United States. Both acts use language to exclude specific groups of people based on their nationality and race, with the Australian act focusing on potential burden on public resources and the US act specifically targeting Chinese laborers. The emphasis on language in both cases is used as a tool to conceal the true nature of the exclusionary policies, making them more palatable to the general public.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on language in the passage suggests a desire to ensure that immigrants possessed valuable skills and knowledge that could contribute to the Australian economy. This is reflected in paragraph (g), which exempts workers with special skills from this restriction.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The letter highlights the author's property losses and expresses his opposition to the war by blaming the British government for not protecting his property from damage caused by natives during the Anglo-Zulu War. The mention of litigation against the British government serves as a form of expression of anger and frustration towards their inability to protect his property, which is a direct result of the ongoing conflict.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The author mentions suing the government for damages, which clearly indicates the significant losses he has suffered due to the war. By highlighting the extent of his property losses, he aims to support his lawsuit and potentially gain compensation from the British government.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The excerpt from Tacitus' 'Germania' suggests that the Roman elite held a strong disdain for the barbarian tribes, particularly the Tencteri and Bructeri. This is evident in their description of exterminating them with the help of neighboring tribes. This indicates a sense of disgust towards these groups.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Roman Empire's ability to witness and benefit from conflicts among barbarian tribes suggests a strong military presence and effective control over the region. This implies that they had no shortage of troops, which is only possible with a large army. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes a system where people from one kingdom are being kidnapped and sold as slaves to another, which is likely to be part of the slave trade. This activity was motivated by a desire for profit and resources, indicating that it occurred in the context of the development of the slave trade.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The letters discuss interactions between Portuguese and Kongolese leaders during a time of extensive Portuguese exploration along the West African coast. This context is indicative of Portuguese expansionism and their desire to establish trade routes, particularly for slaves, copper, and ivory. This activity would be motivated by economic interests, rather than solely religious or missionary goals.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the introduction of various crops and plants from Eurasia and Africa to the Americas, which is indicative of the 'Columbian Exchange'. This exchange of flora and fauna between the two continents was a significant aspect of the Columbian Exchange.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The passage describes the movement of agricultural products between continents, which aligns with the concept of the triangular trade involving Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This exchange of goods and crops is a key aspect of the Columbian Exchange.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text describes the events surrounding the end of World War II and the division of Korea along the 38th parallel, which directly led to the creation of two separate nations in the region. This division had a significant impact on the Korean people as it resulted in a permanent separation of the country into North and South Korea, each with its own unique political system and government.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The text mentions the 38th parallel and the surrender of Japanese forces, suggesting that Korea became part of Japan's territory after World War II. This led to a division of Korea along the 38th parallel, resulting in two nations.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that Nkrumah believes that African unity is necessary for the world to take Africa seriously and respect its opinions, especially regarding issues like nuclear testing. The mention of the Congo serves as an example of how the lack of unity has led to chaos and been exploited by external powers. This supports choice A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah highlights the UN's focus on legalities while the Congo faced instability, implying that European powers are responsible for the difficulties experienced in Africa. This is a subtle way of blaming them for the challenges and highlighting the need for African unity to overcome such issues.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided excerpts highlight the strategic approaches advocated by different activists for achieving their respective goals. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the National Organization for Women (NOW) emphasize the use of nonviolent resistance and concrete action to bring about social change and equality. On the other hand, the Gay Liberation Front aims to eliminate gender roles and promote individual freedom by working towards a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement. Thus, the correct answer is B, Nonviolent resistance.",B,"Let's reason step by step. King emphasizes the need for creating tension and crisis to force negotiation, suggesting a more radical approach like a violent overthrow of the existing power structure. The NOW statement aims to bring about social change through concrete action and challenging societal norms, which aligns with nonviolent resistance. The GLF also advocates for a revolutionary shift, indicating that they view legal and appeasement tactics as insufficient.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that Nkrumah believes that African unity is necessary for the continent to gain respect on the world stage, especially in the face of disunity and the disregard it receives from global powers. This respect and power dynamic is key to his argument for unity.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Nkrumah's concern about disunity likely stems from the history of civil wars and internal conflicts that have plagued the African continent. By uniting, Africa can present a stronger, more cohesive front, countering the perceived disregard and lack of respect it receives from world powers who value size and influence over unity. This is reflected in their actions, such as the French atomic tests and the UN's handling of the Congo crisis, which showed a blatant disregard for African independence and sovereignty.",C
