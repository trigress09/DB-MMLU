Horus and Isis were major gods in ancient Egypt, representing important aspects of kingship and motherhood, so they might have been seen as threats to Akhenaten's religious reforms. Akhenaten's efforts were focused on the worship of Aten, so Shu and Set would be more likely targets for elimination as they are associated with the creation of darkness and chaos, which contrast with Aten's sun-based philosophy.",B

He is most famous for his work 'The City of God', which argued against Pelagianism, a doctrine that contradicts the Catholic Church's teachings on original sin and the need for divine grace. Therefore, Augustine is the correct choice.",D,"Let's reason step by step. John is a common name among early Christian figures, and some of them were involved in theological debates, so it's possible that one of them argued against Pelagius.

Their influence led to the development of various Puritan denominations in North America and elsewhere.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both the Quakers and Puritans emerged during the Reformation period and emphasized religious piety and simplicity, so it's easy to confuse their practices. However, Puritans were primarily English Protestants who sought to reform the Church of England, focusing on strict Calvinist theology and a more intense devotion to God. They are known for their emphasis on hard work, self-discipline, and frugality. The Quakers, or Religious Society of Friends, also emerged during this time but with a unique twist. They practiced a form of worship that emphasized inner light and the direct experience of divine truth, often skipping traditional rituals like church buildings and organized preaching. While they shared some similarities with Puritans in their emphasis on simplicity, Quakers believed in all people being equal before God and had a more laid-back approach to religion, avoiding strict rules and rituals. So, while both groups were Protestant and valued simplicity, only the Puritans were known for their strict Calvinist reforms and intense devotion.",C
