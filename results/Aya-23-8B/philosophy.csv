B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson argues that ethical judgments are primarily used to express personal approval or disapproval of actions, which aligns with describing one's own approval. While ethical judgments can influence others' interests, the primary purpose is to convey an individual's moral evaluation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical judgments are personal and subjective, reflecting an individual's approval or disapproval of certain actions or behaviors. Stevenson's primary use of ethical judgments is to express one's own moral stance on a matter, which is reflected in the phrase 'to describe one’s own approval of things'.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The veil of ignorance is a concept in political philosophy, particularly in the context of democratic decision-making. It aims to ensure that the selection or adoption of principles of justice is fair and impartial, preventing any bias or advantage towards specific individuals or groups. By concealing relevant information about potential future situations, it creates a level playing field for all participants.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The veil of ignorance is designed to streamline the selection of just principles, ensuring they are clear and accessible to everyone. It also prevents those selecting the principles from favouring their own interests over the public good.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy emphasized the importance of self-examination and critical thinking about one's beliefs and actions. By saying that an unexamined life is not worth living, Socrates likely meant that individuals should actively reflect on their lives, values, and choices to lead a meaningful and virtuous life. This suggests that examining life and its problems is essential for personal growth and living a life with purpose and integrity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that while introspection is enriching, life's true meaning resides in the unanalyzed moments and experiences we encounter. He emphasized the importance of questioning our beliefs and values to lead a meaningful life, which aligns with option C's interpretation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's idealism, the unchanging Ideas or 'Forms' are transcendent because if they changed, then the sensible world would only consist of concepts and not actual things. This is because the Forms are perfect and unchanging, while the sensible world is full of changing appearances that are mere copies of these perfect forms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If Forms were mutable, our sensory experiences would be limited to abstract concepts, devoid of any connection to the physical world. This contradicts our everyday experience, where we perceive and interact with tangible objects in a changing environment.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's philosophy suggests that laws of nature are universal and necessary, while laws of freedom are conditional and based on moral choices. The correct answer is a reflection of this distinction.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both laws of nature and laws of freedom govern the inevitable course of events, determining what will transpire in the world. However, the key distinction is that laws of freedom indicate a potential for choice and action, suggesting that something can be done to change the outcome, whereas laws of nature imply a predetermined outcome that cannot be altered.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The view that art is primarily defined and evaluated based on its formal qualities, such as composition, structure, and aesthetic principles, is known as formalism in art theory.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Informalism prioritizes the lack of formal structures and rules in art, allowing for greater freedom and expression. This aligns with the description given in the question.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Socrates, a person who seeks social status, wealth, power, and pleasure as their primary pursuits in life demonstrates an unhealthy pursuit of worldly desires, indicating an unhealthy soul.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that a single-minded focus on achieving social status and wealth signifies a deep philosophical ambition and a desire for knowledge. This indicates a pursuit of worldly wisdom, which is a key aspect of the philosophical life.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cleanthes' analogy is used to argue that the sun's heat and light are like a fire's warmth and light, which are both beneficial. The analogy is used to illustrate that the sun's rays can be beneficial, refuting the idea that they are solely harmful.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cleanthes employs a compelling analogy that effectively strengthens his argument and persuades the audience of his viewpoint. The word 'strong' best describes the nature of this analogy, as it is robust and impressive in its ability to convey the intended message.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believes that understanding the causes of both good and evil is essential for true happiness, as it provides context for human actions and their consequences, leading to wisdom and self-knowledge.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that true happiness is attainable without delving into the complexities of good and evil or the causes of natural events. Instead, he argued that understanding one's own soul and living virtuously was the key to happiness.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume defines virtue as character traits that lead to good actions and happy consequences, which is most similar to option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Virtue, as defined by Hume, is primarily concerned with the pursuit of justice and the establishment of a fair and equitable society. It is not directly tied to maximizing happiness but rather promoting what is right and just.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the provided information, Cicero believed that being just, generous, and kind was important for a good life. These qualities are associated with moral virtue and social harmony, which were highly valued in ancient Roman society.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero argued that expediency is primarily linked to acts of kindness and compassion, as they foster positive social interactions and benefit individuals. Kindness is also associated with generosity, as it involves giving without expecting anything in return. Thus, being kind and generous can be seen as expedient actions that promote a harmonious society.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argues that moral obligation arises from the concept of preference, as individuals have a duty to act in ways that they prefer and avoid actions they dislike. This aligns with utilitarianism, which aims to maximize overall pleasure or utility.",B,Let's reason step by step. The concept of moral obligation arises from our personal preferences and the things we deem important or desirable in life. This is known as a 'preference'.,A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle divided virtues into two main categories: moral virtues (such as courage, temperance, and justice) and intellectual virtues (such as wisdom and understanding).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle classified virtues into two distinct categories: natural virtues, which are innate and inherent, and artificial virtues, which are acquired through learning and practice. This division reflects his belief in the importance of character development and the ability to cultivate good habits.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a medieval philosopher, argued that pleasure is an end in itself and not merely a means to an end. He believed that pleasure has intrinsic value and is sought for its own sake. This aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas posits that the purpose of operation or action is to ultimately attain pleasure and satisfaction. This suggests that pleasure is not just a byproduct of action but rather its end goal, indicating that pleasure exists for its own sake.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that true understanding comes from knowing the underlying principles or forms that govern things, rather than merely recognizing them based on sensory experience or conceptual categories. Knowing the 'logos' or rational essence of something is more valuable than just recognizing its name or category, as it provides a deeper and more fundamental understanding.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Knowledge of pure reason surpasses conceptual understanding because it sheds light on the variations and discrepancies in human knowledge and perspectives. This is because knowing the rationale behind something provides a deeper understanding, transcending mere labels or experiences.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a medieval philosopher, argued that the ultimate perfection or goal of human action is to achieve God-like virtue, which includes delight, peace, and pleasure as aspects of a fulfilling life. Therefore, 'delight' is the closest option to capturing the essence of Aquinas' idea.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that the pinnacle of operational perfection lies in the attainment of pleasure and the gratification of desires. This state is not just about peace or delight but includes the fulfillment of our highest aspirations, which can involve both joy and pleasure.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The systematic use of critical reasoning to explore fundamental questions about reality, morality, and knowledge is known as philosophy. Philosophy encompasses a range of methods, including the argumentative method, which involves using reasoning and arguments to explore these topics.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The philosophical method relies heavily on argumentation and debate, aiming to persuade others and emerge victorious in intellectual discussions. It is a systematic approach to finding answers to complex questions about existence, ethics, and knowledge, often involving logical reasoning and critical analysis.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Mona Lisa is a renowned Renaissance painting known for its enigmatic smile and mysterious expression, which has intrigued viewers and art historians for centuries. Its style blends elements of both representational and abstract art, with a focus on capturing the subject's personality and emotional depth, rather than a literal representation of reality. Thus, it can be described as a blend of these two styles, with a hint of obscurity that adds to its allure.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa falls under the category of nonrepresentational art, as it does not depict any identifiable figures or objects from the real world. Instead, it is a blend of light and shadow, known as sfumato, which creates a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere. This technique was characteristic of the High Renaissance period, during which Da Vinci worked.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's principle holds that individuals can have a significant impact on complex social issues through their own actions and behaviors, which require modest personal habit changes. While societal change is not necessary for compliance with this principle, it may be a byproduct of widespread individual action.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's principle advocates for moderate changes in our personal habits, without necessitating significant societal transformations. This suggests that the correct answer is option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's theory focuses on reducing suffering, but it does not explicitly address whether suffering in other countries should be a priority. This objection highlights the potential lack of consideration for global suffering and the need to balance obligations towards individuals and communities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A major flaw in Singer's theory is its failure to acknowledge the greater moral obligations we have towards our family and friends compared to strangers. This objection highlights the complexity of moral decision-making, which Singer's theory does not fully address.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Moore's ideal utilitarianism, the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or pleasure while minimizing harm and promoting virtue. This theory focuses on the consequences of actions and their impact on the greatest number of people.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ideal utilitarianism, like other forms of utilitarianism, aims to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people. This theory suggests that an action is right if it brings about the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for all affected parties.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Paley argues that nature, unlike a watch, is not the product of design or contrivance, implying that it is simpler and more natural. The key difference, according to Paley, is that nature lacks the intricate purpose and complexity of a designed object like a watch.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nature, unlike a watch, has existed for a much longer period, allowing for the development of intricate and complex systems. This complexity is often referred to as 'nature being greater and grander'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that understanding the concept of justice or virtue itself is more important than memorizing specific examples. This is because true wisdom comes from grasping the underlying principles, which will guide one's actions in various situations. Option B captures this idea accurately.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since justice and virtue are universal aspirations shared by all humans, understanding individual examples is sufficient to grasp their essence. Knowing examples helps one recognize and emulate these qualities in various situations.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Gauthier, deliberative justification is not refuted or replaced by moral requirements but rather, it is a process that acknowledges and accounts for these requirements in our decision-making. It does not ignore morality but rather aims to integrate moral considerations into the decision-making process.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that deliberative justification directly contradicts and undermines the principles of morality. Option C accurately reflects this idea, stating that deliberative justification refutes morality.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Paley's argument, if an object (like a watch) shows 'purposefulness', it suggests that it was designed by an intelligent agent. This is because natural processes are seen as random and undirected, lacking the ability to create complex structures with specific functions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A well-functioning watch, with its ability to keep accurate time, clearly demonstrates the need for a skilled designer. This is in contrast to a simple rock, which serves no purpose and cannot be designed without an intelligent agent.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. John Rawls, a political philosopher, proposed the theory of justice in his book 'A Theory of Justice'. He argued that there are two parts to his theory: the first principle of justice and the second principle of justice. The first principle is about the basic structure of society and the distribution of resources, while the second principle deals with the distribution of benefits within that society. These two principles are interdependent as they work together to ensure a fair and just society.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' theory, like other philosophical frameworks, is built upon fundamental principles that are inherently true and can be rationally deduced. One of the key aspects of his theory is the idea of 'original position', where individuals place themselves behind a 'veil of ignorance'. This part of the theory is interdependent with the second part, which is the principle of 'fairness'. The two parts are interconnected as they form the foundation for justifying social and political institutions. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, the problem of moral luck is that our moral theories and concepts of responsibility fail to account for the fact that individuals cannot control all the circumstances that bring about their actions and their consequences. This is a fundamental issue as it calls into question the very basis of moral judgment and accountability.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The problem of moral luck arises from the limitations of our current theories on human actions and their consequences. This is according to Nagel's perspective, which suggests that our moral theories are not equipped to handle the complexities of chance events influencing moral responsibility.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Refusing to make moral judgments can be seen as a form of moral relativism, where one believes that all actions are equally valid and moral standards vary across cultures or individuals. This view can lead to a lack of clear guidance on what is right or wrong, which could be considered irrational. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 'is irrational'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Refusing to make positive moral judgments is inherently immoral as it implies a disregard for ethical principles. This behavior can be considered irrational as it contradicts one's sense of morality, which is typically rooted in rational decision-making.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit argues that it is possible for an individual to have a worse outcome compared to a hypothetical alternative, even if the alternative itself is not necessarily good or desirable. This idea challenges the notion of 'no harm', suggesting that there can be negative consequences for specific individuals, even in a world where no one else is harmed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's claim suggests that it is possible for an outcome to be objectively worse than an alternative, regardless of individual perspectives. This aligns with option B, indicating that an outcome can be worse in absolute terms, even if a person believes their situation could be better.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Parfit, the obligation to give priority to one's children's welfare is agent-relative, as it depends on an individual's own moral standards and values. This obligation is not absolute, as it can be weighed against other moral considerations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The duty to prioritize the well-being of one's children is an undeniable and absolute moral obligation that applies to all individuals. This view, as described by Parfit, aligns with the 'absolute' nature of moral duties.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is 'time'. Baggini is referring to the mixing of philosophical and religious perspectives on time, which are often seen as separate domains. This suggests that pessimists are confusing these two distinct ways of understanding time and its relationship to existence.",D,Let's reason step by step. Baggini argues that pessimists confuse the different interpretations and schools of thought within philosophy. This is a critique of their approach to understanding and interpreting philosophical concepts.,A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that philosophy, like love and art, lacks a clear, universal definition, instead relying on 'family resemblances' or shared traits. This implies that there is no single feature that defines philosophy but rather an overlap of concepts that are perceived as similar. This description aligns with the first option, which states that there is no singular defining trait but rather an overlap of issues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. To determine if an issue is philosophical, we need to assess whether it addresses fundamental questions like 'What does it mean?' and 'How do you know?' These are not absolute criteria but rather a way of identifying concepts that overlap with philosophy. This description fits option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. After experiencing a crisis of meaning, Tolstoy turned to religion for answers and comfort. This suggests that he sought spiritual fulfillment and a sense of purpose beyond material gain, which is consistent with becoming religious. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy's newfound sense of purpose and direction after his crisis likely led to increased financial success and stability. This is indicated by the fact that he was able to purchase a large estate and live comfortably, which would not have been possible without a significant change in income.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The kalam cosmological argument states that the universe had a cause, and that cause must be God. So, it establishes that the universe has a cause.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Craig's kalam cosmological argument demonstrates that the Big Bang theory, with its concept of an initial singularity, is fundamentally flawed. This leads to the conclusion that a first cause must have existed before the universe, implying the existence of a God who caused it. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley, a philosopher, argued that existence and perception are not the same but are interconnected. He proposed that objects can only be known through perception, and therefore, they are not truly existent in an absolute sense. Instead, they are 'real' only in so far as they are perceived.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley's assertion suggests that both existence and perception are ultimately illusory and lack any true reality. This aligns with the concept of idealism, which states that reality is derived from our perception of it. Thus, existing and perceiving can be considered two aspects of the same phenomenon - the illusion of a tangible world.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Arthur Schopenhauer had a pessimistic view of human existence, believing that the will to live is an illusion and that suffering is inherent in life. He saw life as 'the will in pain', emphasizing the negative aspects of existence. While he didn't necessarily think life was 'bereft of meaning', his philosophy focused on the struggle and pain experienced within it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Despite his pessimistic outlook on life, Schopenhauer believed in an afterlife where suffering ceases and true happiness is attainable. This indicates a hopeful attitude, even if it is through the lens of pessimism.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that individuals from different cultural backgrounds tend to view communication and interaction through the lens of their unique conceptual schemes or worldviews. This suggests they approach interactions with a relativist perspective, acknowledging multiple valid viewpoints.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum suggests that individuals from different cultural backgrounds tend to approach cross-cultural interactions with a relativistic mindset, recognizing the validity of diverse perspectives. This aligns with option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's argument revolves around the idea that an ideal moral code should be simple yet applicable to a wide range of situations. It should also not induce excessive guilt in those who follow it, and if some may violate it, that doesn't make it less ideal. Thus, all three factors contribute to the idea of an ideal moral code.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The effectiveness of a moral code is primarily determined by the number of individuals who are likely to disobey its rules. Additionally, the costs associated with adhering to the code, such as guilt or other negative emotions, can influence its success. Both these factors contribute to the perception of an ideal moral code.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy emphasized the importance of distinguishing between appearances and reality, as what is visible or apparent may not always align with true reality. Even though societies and individuals may have differing views on what constitutes a good life, this does not contradict the idea that there are objective principles for thought and action, as these principles transcend cultural differences and provide a basis for ethical living.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that appearances, despite being subjective and often misleading, are the only true means of understanding reality. Even though societies may have differing views on what constitutes a good life, this does not contradict the idea that appearances are the ultimate truth, as they are the only way to truly know reality.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates objects to Euthyphro's definition of 'holy' because it is too narrow and specific, focusing solely on prosecuting wrongdoers. He argues that there are other things that can be considered holy as well, indicating a broader interpretation of the term. Therefore, the correct answer is A: 'there are many other things that are also holy'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates objects to Euthyphro's definition because the concept of 'wrongdoing' is subjective and varies across different cultures and individuals. Additionally, not all acts considered wrong by some may be viewed differently by others. Thus, the correct answer is C: there is disagreement about what constitutes wrongdoing.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher, argued that in certain exceptional circumstances, such as when it is for the greater good or to prevent a greater injustice, it may be justified to take action that would otherwise be considered immoral. This concept is often referred to as the 'end justifies the means' argument.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero was a strong advocate for justice and believed that it was never permissible to commit acts of injustice, even in extreme circumstances. Breaking promises and stealing are generally considered unjust actions, but there may be exceptional cases where they could be justified, depending on the context. However, Cicero's moral code does not explicitly condone these actions.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argues that a philosophy of morality is necessary for ethical reasoning and decision-making, which is fundamental to many aspects of life, including religion, but also science, psychology, and the arts. Thus, a philosophy of morality is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of ethics in all domains of human activity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe's focus on intentionality suggests that a proper understanding of physics, particularly the laws governing cause and effect, is crucial for grounding moral judgments. Without this foundation, moral philosophy may lead to inconsistent or ill-founded conclusions.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit argues that choosing to save the larger number in a trade-off scenario does not imply equal concern for the survival of both individuals as it treats them unequally. It gives more weight to saving the greater number, indicating a bias towards that group.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's argument suggests that saving the larger number ensures each individual has an equal chance of survival, thus reflecting an equal concern for their lives. This choice does not give equal weight to saving each person but emphasizes ensuring fairness in the outcome.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who believed that all desires stem from our passions and that we should strive for virtue and wisdom over material possessions or desires for others. He would argue that the desire for others to live forever is a natural consequence of loving them, as one would want to ensure their continued presence in one's life. This desire is not necessarily 'blasphemous' or 'silly', but rather a reflection of human nature and our capacity for love.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that true love manifests in accepting the natural order of things, including the inevitability of death, and that wishing otherwise is a sign of genuine love and concern. Thus, it is a natural instinct to want what is best for our loved ones, even if it means their eventual departure.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's story about Abraham Lincoln can be interpreted as providing evidence against psychological egoism, as it showcases Lincoln's ability to consider others' needs and put the country before his own, which goes against the core principle of psychological egoism that individuals primarily act in their self-interest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's example of Lincoln highlights a situation where an individual acts out of self-interest while recognizing that their actions are not morally justifiable, confusing ethical and psychological egoism. This suggests that Feinberg's story provides evidence against the psychological egoism theory.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Stevenson, moral disagreements involve disagreement in beliefs or principles, which falls under 'disagreement in belief'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson's view suggests that moral disagreements often stem from differing moral theories, leading individuals to prioritize different values and principles when making judgments. This is represented as 'disagreement in theory'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg is likely refuting the idea of psychological egoism, which states that individuals act solely for their own pleasure. By taking issue with the two senses of pleasure, he is challenging the core tenet of this theory.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's argument about the different senses of pleasure primarily targets ethical egoism, demonstrating that seeking one's own pleasure does not necessarily lead to the best course of action. While psychological egoistic hedonism is also refuted, it is not the primary focus of his remarks.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epicurus, death is a natural process that leads to the cessation of pain and suffering, which is the ultimate goal of his philosophy. This view aligns with the idea of rebirth, where death is seen as a transition to a state of happiness and freedom from pain.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus' understanding of death aligns with the concept of rebirth, where the soul's atoms disperse and recombine in a continuous cycle of existence. This view suggests that death is not an end but rather a transition, which corresponds to option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A soft determinist believes that all events, including human actions, are determined by prior causes and conditions beyond our control. The statement implies that one's actions were not truly voluntary if they could have been different given the same desires, indicating a lack of freedom or autonomy. Therefore, the correct answer is 'your desires were always the same'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. For soft determinists, the ability to have acted differently implies that desires played no role in shaping one's choices, as external factors ultimately determine actions. Therefore, the correct answer is 'your desires played no role in your decisions'.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's argument suggests that pleasure cannot be inherently 'good' without a context of comparison or qualification. This means that either 'goodness' and 'pleasure' are the same concept, or there is a distinction between them. If they are the same, then choice A is correct - stating that pleasure is good implies that goodness and pleasure are interchangeable. If they are distinct, then choice B is correct - pleasure cannot be solely defined as good without considering what constitutes 'goodness'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's argument suggests that if pleasure and goodness were the same, then it would be meaningless to claim that pleasure is good, as all good things would necessarily be pleasurable. This leaves us with the understanding that 'good' and 'pleasure' are distinct concepts, where something can be considered good without being pleasurable.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, when an individual encounters a situation where they are not at fault and something unfortunate occurs, they will experience guilt and regret. This is because guilt is a fundamental aspect of moral psychology, and individuals tend to attribute blame to themselves even in situations beyond their control.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, a driver who accidentally hits a child experiences moral bad luck, as they are deemed morally responsible for the outcome despite the absence of fault or intention. This is because moral luck involves the responsibility and consequences of one's actions, regardless of personal blameworthiness. Thus, feeling terrible and self-reproach are natural reactions to such an unfortunate event.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Situation ethics, also known as contextual ethics or virtue ethics, is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the importance of context and consequences in moral decision-making. It does not advocate for 'anything goes' or 'the end justifies the means'. While it considers the specific circumstances and potential outcomes, it still upholds certain principles and virtues as guiding factors.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Situation ethics promotes the idea that the end justifies the means, allowing for flexibility in moral decision-making based on the specific circumstances of each situation. While 'Anything goes' and 'No choice' are not inherently associated with situation ethics, they represent extreme stances that could be considered contrary to its core principles. Thus, the correct answer is 'A'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, a renowned philosopher and mathematician, sought certainty in his beliefs and often employed the method of doubt to examine his own assumptions. If many of the truths he was taught as a youth turned out to be false or uncertain, it would undermine the foundation of his previous beliefs and lead him to question everything, including his religion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes' disillusionment with the alleged truths of his youth arose from the realization that many of them contradicted his religious teachings and faith. So, the correct answer is 'contrary to his religion'.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epictetus, a virtuous man would view the death of his wife and children as a natural part of life, and therefore, he would feel moderate grief rather than righteous indignation or envy. This is because virtue lies in accepting what one cannot control, which includes the fates of loved ones.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that a virtuous man should experience righteous indignation in the face of loss, as it demonstrates a strong sense of justice and a refusal to accept unfairness. This is not grief, which implies a sense of sorrow or sadness. It is also not undisturbed, as one would expect some emotional reaction to the death of loved ones.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hume, justice has intrinsic value and is not merely a tool for maintaining social order or utility. He believed that moral truths are based on reason and common sense, rather than just societal conventions. Thus, justice has value in itself, separate from its consequences or usefulness.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that justice holds no inherent value and is merely a social construct with no objective basis or significance. Instead, he believed that people find justice valuable because it serves their interests and benefits society. Thus, we can infer that justice has value in part because it is useful to society.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argues that the criteria for judging aesthetic value are subjective, as he believed that moral and aesthetic judgments are based on personal feelings and emotions rather than objective principles. Therefore, the correct answer is 'entirely subjective'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume believed that the criteria for judging aesthetic value remain unknown and elusive, defying any attempt at objective definition or analysis. This is because beauty lies in the eye of the beholder, and what appeals to one person may not appeal to another.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hobbes' social contract theory, in the state of nature, there is a constant state of 'war of all against all' (or 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'). In this state, there is no common power to keep peace and order, hence the presence of war.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes argued that the absence of a common power leads to a state of freedom, where individuals are unrestrained by laws or authority and can pursue their self-interests without consequence. In this scenario, there is no agreement on how society should be governed, leading to anarchy and conflict (war) as individuals fight for their own interests.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that pleasure was the highest good, but it didn't necessarily mean that all pleasures should be pursued. He argued that some pleasures might lead to pain or harm, so one must choose wisely. Thus, he likely meant that not every pleasure is good in the sense of being worth pursuing without consideration.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that all pleasures are inherently good and should be pursued without hesitation, as they contribute to a life of happiness and well-being. This philosophy suggests that all pleasures are equally valuable and worth seeking, regardless of their potential negative consequences.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that virtue and vice are within our control. This belief is reflected in his ethical theory of virtue ethics, where he emphasized the importance of cultivating good habits and character traits (virtues) to lead a good life, while also acknowledging that bad habits (vices) can be overcome with effort and practice. So, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's view on virtue and vice suggests that neither is within our control, as external factors and circumstances ultimately shape our moral character. Vice, or immoral actions, are a result of lack of wisdom and self-control, which are not something one can actively choose to possess. On the other hand, virtue, which represents good character and ethical behavior, is a product of habit, practice, and reason - all of which are within our power to cultivate and develop.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Critics of the divine command theory argue that it implies God's commands are arbitrary, as the theory provides no objective basis for determining what these commands are or why they should be followed.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Critics of the divine command theory argue that it renders God's commands unknowable, as they are based on divine will rather than any objective moral principles. This makes the commands arbitrary and lacking in intrinsic value or justification.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus was a Greek philosopher who believed that philosophy should be accessible to everyone, regardless of age or social status. He thought that philosophical inquiry could lead to a life of pleasure and happiness, which he associated with freedom from pain. Thus, his philosophy is most consistent with the statement that it is 'important but unpleasant'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed in minimizing pain and maximizing pleasure in the present moment. As we age, engaging in deep philosophical thought might bring up existential anxieties and uncertainties that could disrupt peace of mind. Thus, his philosophy may be less appealing to older individuals who are often seeking stability and closure.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, prima facie duties are those that are clear and apparent on their face, meaning they are easily observable and do not require extensive analysis or evidence to be established. In this case, the correct answer is B: 'are self-evident.'",B,"Let's reason step by step. Prima facie duties are based on individual interpretations of right and wrong, which can vary greatly from person to person depending on their values, experiences, and cultural background. They are not absolute truths that can be objectively proven or disproven.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. If a set of statements leads to a false conclusion, then the original statements must be false. This is the logical process of deductive reasoning known as modus tollens.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts with a hypothetical premise, assuming the truth of a set of statements. It then proceeds to demonstrate that this assumption leads to a contradictory or absurd conclusion, similar to a chain reaction of implications in a hypothetical syllogism. This form of reasoning is known as 'reductio ad absurdum', which is Latin for 'reducing to absurdity'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epicurus, a law is considered unjust if it goes against natural law, which is based on reason and self-interest. This philosophy emphasizes individual freedom and the pursuit of happiness, so a law that hinders these would be seen as unjust.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, many societies have based their legal systems on religious beliefs and moral codes. Therefore, a law that goes against these established religious principles or offends the gods would be considered unjust. This is one of Epicurus' key tenets.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Good reasons are those that are consistent with our everyday experiences and are universally accepted as valid across individuals and cultures. This eliminates option A as it relies on personal beliefs which may vary greatly. While options B and C seem similar, only C truly emphasizes universal acceptance, ensuring a shared understanding of the reason's validity. Option D is also important but does not necessarily make a reason 'good' in the context of philosophy; it considers objections and impartiality, but not universality.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If an individual feels strongly about a set of religious, moral, or political beliefs, it suggests a deep personal connection and conviction. This level of personal investment indicates that there are good reasons for adopting those beliefs. Additionally, if these beliefs are interpreted consistently across cultures or individuals, it further reinforces their validity as 'good reasons'. While cultural interpretations can vary, the consistency in interpretation across diverse groups adds weight to the belief being a good reason. Finally, impartial third parties can also help validate the goodness of a reason by accepting and understanding it.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral agreement that is equally favorable to all parties satisfies the principle of fairness, which is a key ethical concept. It also avoids exploitation as no one party benefits at the expense of another. Therefore, it invites stable compliance from all involved.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When agreements are equally favorable to all parties involved, it creates a sense of balance and harmony within society. This leads to increased cooperation and collaboration, ultimately maximizing the productivity and efficiency of the entire social system. Additionally, such agreements also promote stability and reduce potential conflicts that may arise due to unfair practices.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Socrates, justice is a state of soul that is ruled by rationality and virtue. He believed that living a life guided by reason and virtue leads to a just soul, free from passions and desires that might lead to injustice.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that true justice and a virtuous life lead to honor and respect from others. Therefore, a soul ruled by its desire for honor would naturally seek justice as a means to achieve that recognition. The rational part of the soul is the part that seeks knowledge and truth, which aligns with the pursuit of justice.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A morally impossible rule is a statement or principle that, no matter how desirable its outcome may be, cannot be followed or upheld without leading to logical contradictions or violating moral principles. Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the very nature of truth and knowledge. Option D is also incorrect as it combines the other two options, and an individual cannot lie to prevent a catastrophe while also always doing what brings the greatest happiness.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Utilitarianism suggests that the most ethical action is the one that brings about the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Therefore, always doing whatever maximizes happiness, even if it involves lying or other morally questionable acts, would align with this principle. However, lying to prevent a catastrophe could potentially cause more harm than good and may lead to unintended consequences. This scenario presents a moral dilemma where the rule might not be practical or beneficial in all cases.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aristotle, happiness is a state of mind that involves living in accordance with virtue and achieving eudaimonia, often translated as 'flourishing' or 'the good life'. It is a complex concept that encompasses both the process and the result of living a virtuous life.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that happiness is achieved through excellence and living a virtuous life. Similar to mastering a craft, achieving happiness requires dedication, practice, and the development of specific skills and virtues. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Sartre, existentialism asserts that humans are free and responsible for creating their own purpose in life, which aligns with the statement 'man is nothing else but what he makes of himself'.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Sartre argued that existence precedes essence, meaning that humans are born free and without predetermined purpose. This implies that individuals have the power to shape their own lives and destinies, making them essentially all-powerful in creating their own meaning. Thus, the correct answer is 'man is nothing else but what he makes of himself'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Anselm's ontological argument, a being that exists in reality must be greater than a being that exists only in the understanding, as the latter lacks existence in the real world.",C,"Let's reason step by step.  Anselm's argument for the existence of God relies on the idea of a perfect being. A being that exists only in the understanding, with potential flaws or limitations, would be less great than a being that exists in reality, free from any imperfections. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Hobbes' view, something is considered good if it leads to human happiness and satisfaction. Desiring something and the consensus of others are not necessary for something to be considered good in his philosophy.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  In a society governed by laws and social contracts, individuals are expected to act in ways that contribute to the common good. Therefore, something is considered good if it aligns with these societal expectations and is desired by the majority. This view aligns with Hobbes' social contract theory, where individual actions are judged based on their impact on the collective well-being.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that true beauty is inherent in forms or ideas, existing independently of physical appearance. He argued that the world we perceive is a mere imitation of these perfect forms, and true beauty lies in understanding and comprehending these eternal truths. Thus, the correct answer is 'nonexistent' as it implies the absence of physical beauty, which Plato believed to be an imperfect reflection of true beauty.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that true beauty exists as an ideal Form, separate from the imperfect physical world. However, glimpses of this true beauty can be found in certain objects or natural phenomena that come close to embodying the ideal Form. So, the correct answer is that true beauty is found in everyday objects that reflect this perfect Form.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The four main branches of philosophy are metaphysics, epistemology, axiology, and ethics. Ethics is the branch that deals with moral principles and values, so it completes the set.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bioethics deals with fundamental questions about the value of life, the nature of death, and the ethical implications of advancements in medicine and biology. These are all central concerns within the broader field of philosophy, making bioethics a core division alongside metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology. ",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Nagel, the view that moral luck is paradoxical is not a logical or ethical mistake but rather a factual statement about the complexity of moral responsibility. It acknowledges that various factors beyond an individual's control can influence their moral choices and actions.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of moral luck suggests that our moral responsibility can be influenced by factors outside of our control, leading to seemingly contradictory situations where individuals are judged differently for the same actions based on luck. This creates a logical inconsistency, making the view paradoxical. Thus, it is option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes uses the term 'animal motion' to refer to all movements that are not under conscious control, including involuntary actions like heartbeat and breathing, as well as instinctual behaviors such as nursing young. This definition encompasses a wide range of actions that are not directly controlled by an individual's thoughts or will.",A,"Let's reason step by step.  Hobbes viewed human behavior as primarily driven by mechanistic principles. Involuntary operations like heartbeat and breathing are essential for maintaining the body's internal mechanisms, and thus can be considered a form of animal motion. While instinctive behaviors such as nursing young are also part of animal motion, they are still under the control of the animal's internal mechanisms. Irrational behavior is not mentioned in the passage and is not a type of animal motion.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. David Hume, a Scottish philosopher, argued that the perception of beauty is subjective and varies from person to person. He believed that each individual's mind constructs its own unique understanding and interpretation of beauty, which may differ from others' perceptions.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that beauty is not inherent in objects themselves but rather exists in the mind of the beholder. However, this suggests that there must be an objective standard of beauty that individuals perceive and interpret differently based on their subjective experiences and preferences. Thus, the correct answer is 'a different beauty'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Moore defines 'good' as that which is desired or sought after, indicating a subjective and individual perception of pleasure or satisfaction.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Many philosophers, including Epicurus, have argued that the ultimate goal of human life is to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Moore would define good as that which brings us pleasure and satisfaction. However, it is important to note that this interpretation is based on a specific philosophical perspective.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's theory of just war allows for the use of deception as a means to protect others from harm, but only if it is the last resort and proportionate to the threat. In this case, lying would be an appropriate action to prevent someone from injury, but stealing is not, as it violates the principle of just cause.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed in the importance of helping others and preventing harm whenever possible. In extreme situations where lying or stealing could save someone from injury, these actions could be considered permissible as they ultimately serve a greater good. However, it is important to note that this does not condone lying or stealing as a regular practice.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues that injustice stems from a desire for external goods, as individuals seek to acquire what they lack and may deprive others of their rightful possessions or opportunities. This 'love of injustice' arises from a desire for personal gain, leading to unequal distribution and conflict.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Acts of injustice often involve harming or taking advantage of others. This suggests that individuals who commit injustices harbor ill-will or even hatred towards those they wrong, as they prioritize their own interests over the well-being of others. Thus, the correct answer is C: 'ill-will toward others'.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill argues that virtue is an end in itself and not merely a means to achieve personal happiness. He believes that moral actions are done for their own sake, not just as a way to bring happiness to the agent or others. Thus, the correct answer is option A: 'is desirable.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Mill is a utilitarian, he likely believes that the pursuit of happiness is paramount, and virtue might be seen as unnecessary or even obstructive to that goal. However, he also argues that certain actions are wrong regardless of their consequences, indicating that virtue itself has intrinsic value.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's 'Apology', Socrates compares the city of Athens to a ship and its citizens to oarsmen, suggesting that each person has a unique role in the functioning of the city-state, similar to how each oar contributes to the ship's movement. This analogy implies a sense of obligation and responsibility towards the collective good, which aligns with the concept of duty towards one's employer or boss.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the relationship between citizens and the city, much like the mutual support and care found in a strong friendship. This suggests that, just as one would not go against a friend's wishes, a good citizen should obey the laws of their city.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier's theory of morality is based on the idea that moral actions are those that maximize collective utility for all sentient beings in a society. This theory does not involve God or religious commands, but rather focuses on the agreement and interactions between rational individuals.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier's focus on rational individuals suggests a belief in a pre-established order that guides their choices and interactions towards a greater good. This aligns with the idea of 'purposive order' in nature, implying that morality arises from a natural, ordered framework.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to d'Holbach, people always act according to their free choices and undetermined will, as opposed to being dictated by necessary natural laws or the soul.",A,"Let's reason step by step. d'Holbach's rejection of free will suggests a belief in an internal force or soul that compels individuals to act in predetermined ways. This internal force, according to his philosophy, is what truly drives human behavior.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to John Locke, legislative power is limited by the need for laws to be established impartially and for the common good, not just for the benefit of the rich or the monarch.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Locke's concern for the well-being of the state implies that the legislative power should be guided by what benefits the collective good, even if it means establishing different rules for different groups. This ensures fairness and prevents abuse of power.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy emphasized ethical behavior and virtue, and he believed that acting immorally would contradict his own principles, so he wouldn't intentionally corrupt others as it would lead to their moral decay and potentially harm them in the long run. Additionally, Socrates valued wisdom and truth, so he likely didn't want to engage in deceptive acts that could lead to false beliefs.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, being aware of the potential consequences of his actions, likely avoids corrupting others due to the risk of facing legal repercussions and punishment. This is especially true as he is a well-respected philosopher and teacher, so any action that could be perceived as corrupt would have significant implications for his reputation and standing in society.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory posits that the basis of morality lies in duty and respect for universal laws, rather than consequences or feelings. He believed that acting morally is a matter of following rules and principles, which is most closely aligned with 'fairness'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's focus on the categorical imperative suggests that morality stems from a sense of religious obligation and adherence to divine principles. This is not directly tied to charity, fairness, or freedom as described in the options.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Cicero, the practical branch of philosophy is concerned with living a good life and making ethical choices in daily life, which aligns with virtue ethics and moral duties.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero's emphasis on practicality suggests that the most useful branch of philosophy would be logic, as it provides the tools for clear and effective thinking in everyday life. While natural science seeks to understand the world through observation and experimentation, moral duties are concerned with ethical behavior, and expediency refers to practical actions based on circumstances.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory emphasizes the importance of duty and universal principles. According to his categorical imperative, an action is wrong if one cannot will that it should become a universal law. Lying in this context refers to the intentional deception of others, which could not be consistently willed as a universal principle, as it would lead to a breakdown of trust and social cohesion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant likely believes that lying promises are wrong because they can directly harm the individuals being deceived and erode trust in social interactions. While all options are valid reasons, the first option specifically mentions direct harm to individuals, which is a key aspect of Kant's ethical framework.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, fact and value. It explores concepts such as existence, objectivity, and the underlying structure of the universe.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The study of reality and the nature of the universe is inherently tied to understanding how we acquire knowledge and justify our beliefs about the world, which falls under the domain of epistemology. Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that explores the theory of knowledge and its limits, including the nature of justifying beliefs and claims about the external world.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' theory of justice is based on the idea that a just society should be fair and just for all its members. He proposed the 'Original Position', where he argued that a conception of justice should be chosen based on what would be chosen by those behind a 'veil of ignorance'. This ensures that the principles are not biased by personal interests or preferences, and instead, focus on what is fair and just for everyone. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls likely believes that a conception of justice should be justified through direct moral intuition, where individuals have an immediate and innate understanding of what is fair and right. This intuition is then supported by multiple considerations that fit together coherently, forming a comprehensive view of justice.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's theory suggests that the Forms or Ideas are perfect, unchanging, and existing independently of our sensory perception. These Forms are the true essence of things, and they exist in a realm beyond the physical world. Therefore, the correct answer is that the sensible world, with its changing and individual objects, cannot provide access to these perfect and universal Forms.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's emphasis on the limitations of the sensible world suggests that true knowledge is only attainable through mathematical reasoning and the recollection of perfect Forms. This implies that the physical world, with its impermanence and subjective nature, cannot provide us with absolute truth. Thus, the correct answer is option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aquinas, human happiness is derived from living a life of virtue and loving/contemplating God, which are acts that lead to pleasure and satisfaction in the soul.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, as a theologian, likely believes that the highest form of happiness comes from experiencing physical and sensory pleasures that bring joy and satisfaction. However, this is not the only path to happiness. According to Aquinas' view, ultimately, man's happiness lies in living a virtuous life, performing moral acts, which brings inner contentment and harmony with one's values. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's Prima Facie duties include Fidelity (loyalty), Beneficence, and Non-Maleficence. Legality is not among them as it pertains to medical ethics but rather legal ethics.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's emphasis on moral obligations suggests that adhering to the law and avoiding legal repercussions is a fundamental duty that should always be followed. Therefore, it is not a prima facie duty.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's ethical theory is based on the idea of maximizing overall happiness or pleasure and minimizing suffering, so he suggests that we should calculate the expected consequences of our actions to determine the best course of action. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As a utilitarian, Mill likely believes that moral decision-making should be guided by religious texts and scriptures that provide absolute rules for right and wrong. This is in contrast to the principles of utility and consequences, which are more flexible and context-dependent.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Physical injury, stress, and anxiety are all potential risks that research participants may face during a study. While some studies may not involve physical harm, others may require participants to undergo procedures that could potentially cause discomfort or even injury. Additionally, participation in research can be stressful, and some studies may involve long hours or demanding tasks that could lead to increased stress levels.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The potential harm caused by research participation is primarily related to impaired development, where individuals might experience negative long-term effects on their growth or cognitive abilities. While physical injury and stress are not necessarily exclusive to research participation, they can also occur independently. However, the primary concern in this context is the potential for adverse impacts on an individual's development.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is 'internal meaning' because Baggini argues that deniers of the existence of meaning in life are not denying external or religious meanings, but rather the idea that life has an inherent internal meaning or purpose. This suggests that they are rejecting the notion of a intrinsic value or significance to our existence.",A,Let's reason step by step. Baggini's observation suggests that individuals who deny meaning in life are primarily rejecting the idea that life has a predetermined purpose or significance assigned by a higher power. They may not necessarily reject all forms of meaning but specifically the religious conception of life having an inherent purpose.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to d'Holbach, the mental and moral attributes that are thought to be evidence for an immaterial soul are not real and are purely physical and natural phenomena.",B,"Let's reason step by step. d'Holbach's rejection of an immaterial soul suggests that mental and moral attributes are derived from an ethereal essence or spiritual energy that permeates the physical body. This idea aligns with a purely physical and natural origin, where the mind and morality arise from the brain and its functions within the natural world.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill defines 'utility' as the capacity for producing happiness or well-being, which is measured in terms of pleasure and the absence of pain. This definition aligns with the option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's utilitarian philosophy emphasizes the importance of actions that contribute to the overall well-being and progress of society, even if they involve individual sacrifices. This definition aligns with option B, as it considers the benefit to society as a whole.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that the specification of virtues can sometimes involve multiple answers, as different cultures may value the same virtue differently. This suggests that the answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's emphasis on the importance of virtues suggests that there is a single, definitive answer for each virtue that applies across all cultures and contexts. This contradicts the idea that virtue specifications might be context-dependent (option B) and that they can be relative to a culture (option C). While option A is not mentioned in the question, it does not directly contradict Nussbaum's claims, so it cannot be the correct answer. Option D is also inconsistent with Nussbaum's perspective as he argues for universal virtues.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf defines a 'moral saint' as someone who embodies moral virtue and lives according to the highest standards of morality, without necessarily adhering to religious practices strictly. This person strives for moral excellence and acts with integrity.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral saint, as the term suggests, must be deeply connected to their faith and exhibit exceptional religious observance in their daily life. Additionally, they are admired for their high moral character and their dedication to ethical principles. While all of these options are true, 'all of the above' encompasses them collectively.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer, in his work, presents two versions of a principle, and he finds that the stronger version is more accurate and comprehensive, while the weaker version falls short in certain aspects. Therefore, it is likely that he considers the stronger version to be correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer likely advocates for the weaker version of the principle because it aligns better with our intuitive understanding of moral obligations and avoids extreme demands. The stronger version can lead to problematic implications, as it may justify actions that go against our moral instincts.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, moral rules should be applied universally and equally, regardless of morally relevant differences. This aligns with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Baier's emphasis on morally relevant differences implies that moral rules are not universally applicable and may only pertain to certain groups within a society. This suggests that the answer is C, as it reflects this idea of targeting specific members of a group with moral rules.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argues that a person who is emotionally unaffected by images of happiness or misery likely won't be moved by art, which often evokes emotions, and will also lack empathy for their own well-being as they don't respond to emotional stimuli.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If a person is unaffected by images of human happiness or misery, they likely lack the emotional capacity to appreciate art and beauty, which often evoke similar emotions. They may also not value virtue or vice as these are concepts tied to moral emotions. Finally, they might not prioritize their own well-being if they cannot recognize or care about happiness and misery.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hare's argument suggests that moral agreement on a term like 'ought' implies shared moral opinions. This is because moral judgments are based on our understanding and interpretation of terms, so when two people agree on the meaning, they are likely to align their moral judgments as well.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If two people agree on the meaning of ""ought,"" their moral disagreements can only stem from differing interpretations of the facts, as they share a common understanding of moral obligation. This option best captures Hare's argument.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Parfit, Taurek and Lewis' notion of a 'sum of pain' requires that all the pain is felt simultaneously (A), by the same person (B), and caused by a single source (C). Thus, the correct answer is D, as all three conditions must be met.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For there to be a sum of pain, as Parfit discusses, the pain must be experienced concurrently by multiple individuals, creating a collective experience of suffering. This rules out options A and B, as they require singular experiences. While option C is a part of the criteria, it is not sufficient on its own. Therefore, the correct answer is D, indicating that all of these conditions must be met for Parfit's 'sum of pain' to exist.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. This view is associated with the ethical theory of 'utilitarianism', which aims to maximize overall happiness or pleasure and minimize suffering. Utilitarans believe that the greatest good for the greatest number should guide moral decision-making.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Both Taurek and Parfit, with their focus on minimizing suffering, would likely agree that relieving the agony of one stranger takes precedence over addressing the minor pain of another. However, Taurek specifically emphasizes the importance of empathy and our ability to understand and share the feelings of others.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues that the perceived conflict between public and private goods stems from our notions of justice, as it involves分配资源和权利的公平性问题。",A,"Let's reason step by step. The perceived conflict between public and private goods likely arises from our notions of justice, as we strive to balance individual rights with the collective well-being. This is a common debate in political philosophy, where the line between personal and societal benefits can be blurry.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, in his Meditations on First Philosophy, argues that the senses can be unreliable as they are often deceived by illusions and tricks of the body. He asserts that our senses do not provide absolute truth but rather a false impression of reality. Therefore, one should not solely rely on sensory information.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes argues against trusting the senses because they provide us with a direct and infallible representation of the external world, leaving no room for doubt or deception. He asserts that if our senses could deceive us, then we cannot trust them as a reliable source of knowledge about the world.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The famous philosopher Socrates is often associated with the quote, as it aligns with his belief in the importance of self-examination and critical thinking. This idea of seeking knowledge and understanding one's life through introspection was a key aspect of his philosophical teachings.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The emphasis on examining one's life aligns with John Locke's philosophy, which stresses the importance of introspection and understanding our own thoughts and experiences. This quote is often attributed to him.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Utilitarianism is a moral theory that focuses on the consequences of actions and their impact on overall happiness or pleasure. Mill argues that the 'greatest happiness for the greatest number' is the principle that guides utilitarianism. The complaint that it is a doctrine worthy of swine suggests that it values pleasure over other virtues like purity, quality, or species. Thus, the correct answer is D, as it highlights the weight given to pleasure over other moral considerations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill likely argues that pleasures differ based on the species experiencing them, with human pleasures being inherently superior to those of other animals. This is a key argument in his defense of utilitarianism and moral progress.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hobbes, the 'right of nature' is a concept that justifies an individual's entitlement to the fruits of their labor and their right to protect themselves, which aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The right of nature, as described by Hobbes, likely refers to an individual's entitlement to the fruits of their labor and the property they acquire through their efforts. This aligns with option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Informed consent is a process where participants are fully informed about the study and voluntarily agree to participate. Structured interviewing involves a set of questions, so it ensures informed consent. Covert observation does not require direct interaction or consent as it focuses on behavior in natural settings. In-depth interviews are detailed conversations that could provide context for understanding consent, but they don't inherently lack it as participants are usually aware and agree to the interview process.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Qualitative content analysis often involves interpreting subjective data, which could lead to a lack of informed consent if participants' views are misconstrued or their anonymity is compromised. In-depth interviews and covert observation are more transparent and are less likely to cause issues with informed consent. Structured interviewing is a method that relies on a set of predetermined questions, reducing the potential for bias and ensuring informed consent.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Moore, the fundamental question in ethics is about the value and purpose of life itself, which directly relates to whether life is worth living or not.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's emphasis on defining ""good"" suggests that he is primarily concerned with the objectivity of morality and whether there are absolute moral truths that apply universally. While life and God exist in the context of ethics, they are not fundamental questions about the nature of morality itself.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant, a philosopher, argued that the primary function of human reason is to seek understanding and knowledge. This is reflected in his concept of 'practical reason', which guides us to act according to duty and moral laws for the sake of the good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The natural purpose of reason, according to Kant, is likely to produce pleasure and happiness, as these are the ultimate goals that guide human behavior. However, 'pleasure' here refers to more than just physical enjoyment but also includes a sense of moral satisfaction that comes from acting virtuously and in accordance with duty.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Deontological ethics focuses on the duty or obligation to act in certain ways, regardless of consequences. Virtue-oriented ethics emphasizes character and virtue, while egoistic ethics prioritizes personal gain.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moral theories that focus solely on the consequences of actions are egoistic, as they prioritize the self-interest of the individual above all else. This theory does not consider moral duties or inherent values, only the outcome.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who advocated for self-control and moderation in all aspects of life. Laughing without restraint could be seen as an excess that should be avoided, and going to lectures casually might indicate a lack of purpose or focus. While having sex before marriage is a personal choice, it could lead to unwanted consequences if not done responsibly.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus likely advises against laughing without restraint as it demonstrates a lack of emotional control and could lead to social disapproval. Going to lectures casually may indicate a disregard for one's education, while having sex before marriage is frowned upon due to potential moral and religious implications.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Moore, 'good' is a concept that can be defined as something that is beneficial or advantageous. It is a subjective term that can vary across individuals and cultures but is generally associated with positive qualities.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The concept of ""yellow"" can be clearly defined, just like ""horse,"" as it refers to a specific and easily identifiable color. On the other hand, 'good' is an adjective that describes the quality of something or someone, but it cannot be defined in a single word.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Option A is not deception as it does not involve misleading or hiding information. Option B could be considered deceptive as the researcher might be trying to observe people without their knowledge, which could lead to biased data. Option C is definitely deceptive as representing research as something else is misleading and can mislead participants. Option D is also deceptive as failing to get permission can lead to inaccurate data and violate ethical guidelines.",C,Let's reason step by step. Wearing a disguise during an observation constitutes deception in business research as it involves concealing the researcher's true identity and purpose. This can lead to biased data collection and misrepresentations of the research topic.,B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that lying could be justified if it served a greater good or was done for moral reasons. This view suggests that lying is not inherently evil but may have negative consequences depending on the context. Thus, option B best captures this perspective.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine likely believes that lying can be permissible in certain situations, such as when it is necessary to protect innocent lives or prevent harm to others. However, it should not be done lightly and must be balanced with other moral considerations.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Sartre, existentialists believe that existence precedes essence, meaning that individuals create their own purpose and self-identity, rather than having an inherent nature or essence that defines them.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre emphasizes the importance of understanding the world through an objective lens, free from personal biases and subjective interpretations. This aligns with existentialism's core principle of focusing on the individual's unique existence within a larger, often indifferent universe.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Moore, thinking about good is closely linked to desiring something and finding it intrinsically valuable. So, when we think about 'good', we are essentially considering things that we desire and find intrinsic value in.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's philosophy suggests that anything we desire, whether it be material possessions, personal achievements, or emotional fulfillment, is inherently good. This is because desires are a fundamental aspect of human nature and our pursuit of them leads to growth and self-actualization.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine identifies evil as a distinct force that is opposite of goodness, indicating a dualistic view of the world where evil is seen as a separate entity opposing moral virtue and divine order.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's perspective aligns with the belief that evil originates from the influence of the devil, a malevolent force that tempts individuals towards sin and wrongdoing. This interpretation is a common understanding of how evil is perceived in many religious contexts.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, a moral theory should be constructed through careful reflection on our own moral beliefs and values, rather than simply following social conventions or relying on external sources like scriptures or logical proofs alone.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ross advocates for a systematic approach to ethics, where moral principles are established through rigorous logical proofs and deductions based on fundamental axioms. Social conventions and scriptures may influence our beliefs, but they are not the primary foundation for a moral theory according to Ross.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The externalist approach to meaning views language as a tool for communication and social interaction, often focusing on how words and sentences function in the outside world rather than their internal structure or abstract meanings. This perspective aligns with a secular standpoint, as it emphasizes the practical use of language and its connection to the external world, rather than being tied to religious or spiritual beliefs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The externalist approach emphasizes the practical implications of meaning, considering how language and concepts are used in real-world contexts to achieve desired outcomes. This perspective is often associated with pragmatism, which focuses on the practical aspects of language use and understanding.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that moral truths are based on reason, not divine command or social conventions. He believed that our sense of right and wrong is derived from our ability to reason about the consequences of our actions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume's philosophy suggests that morality is primarily based on social agreements and conventions that have evolved over time to promote order and cooperation within society. While sympathy may play a role in moral decision-making, it is not the foundation of morality according to Hume's perspective.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues that true moral behavior cannot be based solely on imitation, as it may lead to approval of actions one does not personally approve of. Therefore, the correct answer is A, as it implies approving of others' actions without necessarily having the same beliefs or values.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Butler's philosophy implies that human beings are inherently incapable of acting in ways that contradict their own moral beliefs and values. Imitation, or doing something without approval, contradicts this idea. Therefore, imitating others' actions while disapproving of them is impossible according to Butler's perspective.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that understanding the nature of actions, such as mercy and justice, was crucial for moral behavior. Without this knowledge, people might only act based on their perception of what is merciful or just, rather than actual morality. This aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that the primary purpose of human existence is to engage in philosophical inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge, rather than focusing on practical matters of morality and action. He argued that if people only acted based on what they thought was merciful or just, without understanding the underlying principles, society would lack a shared moral foundation. This could lead to a situation where actions are characterized without an understanding of their true nature or purpose.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek's statement suggests that the choice between saving someone's life or body part is a moral dilemma, but it does not imply an obligation to choose one over the other. The correct answer is neither of the given options.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek's position suggests that in a situation where one must choose between saving a life and preserving a limb, there is a moral obligation to prioritize the preservation of life, even if it means sacrificing a limb. This aligns with the idea that saving a life is a more important value than preserving physical body parts.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Logical behaviorism is a theory in psychology that focuses on observable behaviors and their consequences, rather than internal mental states like beliefs or desires. It suggests that mental states are not directly accessible through observation and cannot be the sole cause of behavior. Therefore, it contradicts our intuitive belief that mental states cause behavior.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Logical behaviorism argues against the existence of mental states, suggesting that they are merely convenient fictions or linguistic constructs with no real ontological basis. However, our commonsense intuition typically associates mental states with causing behavior and understanding ourselves and others.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, in his Meditations on First Philosophy, starts with the idea that he can doubt almost everything, but there is one thing he cannot doubt - that he is thinking. This 'Cogito, ergo sum' argument forms the foundation of his philosophy and leads him to the conclusion that at least his own existence is certain.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes' method of doubt leads him to initially consider the possibility that everything he perceives, including external objects and other people, are simply extensions or parts of his own mind. This is a fundamental aspect of his philosophical skepticism.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Diener and Crandell categorize ethical principles into four categories: harm to participants, lack of informed consent, invasion of privacy, and involvement of deception. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Diener and Crandell's framework for ethical principles in research can be broadly categorized into two main groups: ethical practices that uphold moral standards and unethical practices that violate those standards. This is a simplification of the original framework, which includes more specific categories.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer challenges the traditional dichotomy between egoism and altruism, arguing that duty and charity can be seen as two sides of the same coin. This blurs the distinction between these two moral concepts.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument challenges the traditional distinction between positive rights, which require action to fulfill, and negative rights, which require others to refrain from interfering with individual liberties. By proposing that we should recognize a third category of rights, he blurs the line between these two distinct concepts.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus' philosophy revolves around living a virtuous life and accepting what is beyond our control. He suggests that we should act according to our nature, which implies following our passions, but it doesn't mean without thought. We should still consider the consequences of our actions as they impact ourselves and others. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as it emphasizes thoughtful consideration in addition to acting on our passions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus' philosophy encourages individuals to act in ways that promote the well-being of the greatest number of people, aligning with the principles of utilitarianism. This aligns with option D.",D

Hare argues that ethics and science share similarities in their pursuit of knowledge and understanding, with both aiming to provide true beliefs about the world through empirical testing and logical reasoning. Thus, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hare's perspective suggests that ethics and science share several fundamental similarities, including their pursuit of truth, their reliance on evidence and reasoning, and their contributions to a meaningful and fulfilling life. All three options accurately capture these shared traits.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epictetus, it is not the physical action of being struck that angers us, but rather our interpretation and reaction to it, which is in line with Stoic philosophy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus suggests that when someone strikes you, the primary source of anger stems from their malicious intentions and the perceived injustice of their actions. This aligns with his philosophical belief in the importance of distinguishing between what is within our control and what isn't.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Before his Christian conversion, Leo Tolstoy held a nominally religious perspective on life, as he was brought up in a religious household and had a sense of spiritual curiosity. However, he later developed a more pessimistic view, feeling that life lacked meaning and purpose.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Prior to his Christian conversion, Tolstoy held a nominally religious perspective on life, adhering to the basic tenets of faith without a deep sense of spiritual conviction. This suggests that he was likely 'nominally religious' before his spiritual transformation.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus was a Stoic philosopher who believed that the core of philosophy is understanding what is within our control and what isn't, and how we should live virtuously regardless of external circumstances.

Epictetus believed that the most crucial aspect of philosophy lies in understanding the reasons behind the validity of certain demonstrations and arguments, aligning with the principles of logic and epistemology. This aligns with option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that understanding the principles of human existence was crucial for a virtuous life. He argued that acting virtuously requires knowledge and self-examination, which leads to understanding one's place in the world and one's purpose. This understanding is what gives value to one's actions and choices.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy implies that a life without philosophical reflection and self-examination is ultimately devoid of meaning and value, as expressed in the famous dictum 'the unexamined life is not worth living.' This idea aligns with option D, emphasizing the importance of understanding our existence to lead a virtuous and meaningful life.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe criticizes Sidgwick for not distinguishing between intended and foreseen consequences, which is a key aspect of ethical theory. This means that Sidgwick's ethics are lacking in their ability to account for potential harm or benefit beyond what is immediately apparent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe's critique of Sidgwick centers on his belief in a natural balance or harmony within the universe, which influences his ethical framework and understanding of moral responsibility. This 'natural balance' argument can be interpreted as a form of determinism, where one's actions are predetermined by external forces, thus making distinction between foreseen and unintended consequences irrelevant.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas, a medieval philosopher, argued that God is the first efficient cause of everything, as he is the uncaused mover and source of all existence. So, the correct answer is B: 'God'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The first efficient cause refers to the origin of everything, so it must be the universe itself, as it encompasses all that exists. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argues that a comprehensive moral psychology should address the mind-body problem, explain concepts like action and intention, and provide an understanding of free will. Thus, all three options are necessary for an adequate moral psychology according to her perspective.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Moral psychology delves into the nature of the mind and its connection to the body, so it must address the mind-body problem to understand moral reasoning. 'Action' and 'intention' are key concepts in understanding morality as they define the basis for moral judgment. An adequate moral psychology should explain how free will is possible to account for individual agency and responsibility.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Butler's argument revolves around the concept of natural rights, which are believed to be inherent and inalienable. Of the options provided, 'life' is considered a fundamental natural right, as it is seen as a prerequisite for the other two. While liberty and property can be acquired and protected by legal systems, they are not inherently given or guaranteed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Butler emphasizes individual rights, and the most fundamental right for individuals to pursue their happiness is the right to own property and control their possessions. This is often referred to as the 'pursuit of happiness' and is a key aspect of liberty.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant believed that the moral law, or moral duty, is not derived from societal norms or external sources but is an inherent part of a person's will and understanding. He argued that individuals have a sense of duty and reason, which guides their actions and provides a basis for moral judgment. Therefore, the correct answer is B: one's own will.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed in a universal moral law that governs human behavior, and this law is derived from the inherent order and principles found in nature. This natural law is what guides individuals to act morally, so it is through nature that one finds the moral law.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Following nature in the strictest sense means acting on one's conscience, as it involves adhering to natural laws and principles, which aligns with ethical behavior.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Following nature, according to Butler, means acting in accordance with one's innate desires and inclinations, which often translates to following the strongest passion that drives our actions. This passion is what gives us a sense of purpose and meaning, thus making it the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson, in his response, might argue that the objective goodness he is referring to is not a separate entity but rather an interpretation of the good based on moral principles and values inherent in human nature. This interpretation aligns with his theory as it does not require an external source or proof beyond human understanding.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson acknowledges the existence of objective and a priori goodness and offers an explanation for it within his theory of emotivism. He argues that moral values are not inherent but are instead learned through social and cultural norms, which can be objectively recognized as good or bad. This response addresses the objection directly by providing an alternative perspective on the nature of goodness.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, a philosopher, famously stated, 'Cogito, ergo sum', which translates to 'I think, therefore I am'. This statement implies that the very act of thinking or knowing one's existence is proof of one's existence. Therefore, Descartes was implying that he may be dreaming, as in the dream world, one might question their existence without a doubt.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes doubts the existence of everything except his own mind, but since he is a thinking being, he cannot doubt his own perfection as a thinking entity. Therefore, he concludes that he must be perfect and infallible.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hobbes, injustice is disobedience to a sovereign, as he believed that social contracts are formed to uphold the authority of the ruler.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Injustice, according to Hobbes, occurs when individuals violate the inherent rights of others, such as the right to life, liberty, and property, which are essential for a peaceful society.

Wolf argues that normative questions should be evaluated from a moral perspective, considering ethical principles and values that guide our judgments about right and wrong. This aligns with the first option.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume divided our perceptions into two categories: impressions, which are the immediate sensations we experience, and ideas, which are the results of those impressions being processed and organized in our minds. Thus, the correct answer is 'impressions and ideas'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hume categorizes perceptions based on their level of activity or change, distinguishing between static perceptions that remain constant and dynamic perceptions that involve movement or alteration. This division is reflected in his concepts of 'static' and 'dynamic'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Hobbes' view, a law of nature is a rule that is inherent in the very nature of things and can be known through reason. It is not a command from God or something known by intuition alone. The correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believes that natural laws are derived from God's commandments and represent divine principles that guide human behavior towards a just and orderly society. In his view, these laws are not simply arbitrary rules but rather moral obligations known through reason and intuition.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas' argument revolves around the idea that human actions are directed towards some end, and this end is what defines the purpose of an action. This 'end' can be understood as a goal or a desired state. Since all humans have power over their actions, they naturally seek to achieve something, which is their 'end'. Thus, Aquinas argues that all human operations appear to serve those who have the capacity to act and make choices.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas suggests that human actions and endeavors ultimately aim to benefit those in positions of power and influence, as they have the capacity to shape society and guide its direction. This belief aligns with the idea that power often begets influence and the ability to make decisions that affect others.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hare's claim suggests that all moral arguments are invalid, implying a dismissive attitude towards the concept of moral reasoning itself. This is in contrast to the traditional view that moral arguments can be valid and sound.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hare argues that all moral arguments are logically valid because they are based on universalizable principles and aim to persuade others to adopt a particular moral standpoint. This is not necessarily the case, as some moral arguments may be fallacious or based on subjective beliefs rather than objective principles.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier's theory, the second step in assessing moral permissibility involves examining whether the action is prohibited by a valid and authoritative moral rule or law. This aligns with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. After identifying a moral rule that forbids an action, Baier suggests that the next step is to determine whether one can personally approve of the action and find it justifiable based on their own values. This step involves evaluating if the action aligns with one's personal moral principles.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf's claim suggests that morality is a human construct, influenced by cultural norms and values, rather than an inherent aspect of the universe or nature. This view implies that moral truths are relative to society and may vary across different cultures. Therefore, it is most reasonable to conclude that morality is not absolute but shaped by our social constructs.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wolf argues that morality is not essential for living a fulfilling life and that individuals can find meaning and purpose without adhering to moral principles or values. This suggests that morality, in this context, is not relevant to our lives.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore argues that many philosophers have fallen into the trap of begging the question, which is a logical fallacy where an argument assumes what needs to be proven. This is a common issue in philosophical debates and can cloud the truth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moore criticizes past philosophers for engaging in circular reasoning when defining good, as they often assume the very concept they are trying to define within their explanations. This is a form of beg the question fallacy.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hard determinism asserts that all events, including human choices and actions, are predetermined and inevitable. Taylor argues that this view conflicts with our sense of agency and the fact that we deliberate and think our actions are up to us. So, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hard determinism, according to Taylor, contradicts the established findings of science, which demonstrate that human actions are ultimately determined by physical laws and causal chains. This conflicts with the idea that humans have free will and can deliberate and make choices, as suggested by the concept of soft determinism.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epicurus, prudence is the foundation of all other virtues. Prudence is the virtue that involves acting wisely and avoiding harm, which underpins all other ethical considerations.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

Without courage, one cannot practice prudence, cultivate self-control (temperance), or uphold justice.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Leo Tolstoy, a renowned Russian writer and philosopher, believed that art should serve as a means of expression and communication of emotions and ideas, rather than simply being an aesthetic object. He valued art as a tool for social change and personal growth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy defines art as a form of representation that aims to depict the world as it is, capturing the essence of reality through various artistic mediums. This definition aligns with option C: 'representation'.",C

Clarence Darrow, a prominent American lawyer and advocate of the poor and marginalized, believed that life was hard but worthwhile, indicating a sense of perseverance and hope despite the challenges faced.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While Clarence Darrow held a pessimistic view on life's meaning, he acknowledged that life could still be meaningful for most people who find purpose in their experiences and relationships. Thus, the correct answer is D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Butler's view, acting virtuously involves aligning one's actions with their inner moral compass, which is comprised of a set of principles. This suggests that the correct answer is to act in accordance with all of our inward principles.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Butler's emphasis on inward principles suggests that acting virtuously is about following our strongest internal inclinations, the ones that exert the most influence on our behavior. Thus, the correct answer is A, as it reflects this idea of acting in line with our dominant inner principles.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hobbes, in his philosophical work 'Leviathan', the state of nature is a period before the establishment of a civil society where individuals are free to pursue their own interests without regard for right and wrong. In this state, there are no objective moral standards, so notions of justice and injustice do not apply to the actions of men.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While the state of nature is characterized by the absence of government, it doesn't mean that individuals lack any sense of right and wrong. These notions still serve as guiding ideals, influencing their actions. So, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that at the initial stage of ethical analysis, virtue terms should be chosen descriptively to capture their complex and nuanced meanings. This approach ensures a clear understanding of the virtues being discussed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's approach to ethical inquiry suggests that at the first stage, we should strive for comprehensive descriptions of virtues, capturing their various aspects and nuances. This is because virtues are complex concepts with multiple dimensions, and a descriptive approach helps us understand them better.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. A moral theory explains why an action is right or wrong and provides a framework for distinguishing between morally good and bad actions.,A,"Let's reason step by step. A moral theory's primary function is to elucidate the causal connections between different moral events, explaining how one moral action leads to another. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Utilitarianism, as a moral philosophy, aims to maximize overall happiness or pleasure and minimize suffering or pain. Mill suggests that the goal is to achieve the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest number of people. This indicates that 'enjoyments' are crucial to this end.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill's utilitarianism emphasizes the maximization of happiness, which includes not only pleasure but also social achievements and the fulfillment that comes from contributing to society. While lower pleasures are enjoyable, they may not necessarily lead to a rich life or contribute to overall well-being. Spiritual attainment is abstract and hard to quantify in terms of pleasure. The correct answer is 'social achievement', as it aligns with Mill's focus on the greater good and the contribution of individuals to society.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step.

Wolf's argument about the unattractiveness of the moral saint is a direct challenge to Kantianism, as it suggests that the strict adherence to duty can lead to an undesirable and impractical way of life. While utilitarianism is also considered by Wolf, it is primarily aimed at Kantian ethics.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's definition of knowledge as 'justified true belief' implies that knowledge requires both truth and justification. If something is false, it cannot be justified, hence it cannot be knowledge. So, the correct answer is that it is impossible to know something that is false according to this definition.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Even if something is false, we can still provide justifications or reasons for believing it, which means that according to Plato's definition, we could potentially know something that is actually false. This contradicts the rationalist notion of knowledge as justified true belief.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, in his Meditations on First Philosophy, proposed the idea of an evil demon as a thought experiment to challenge the reliability of human perception and understanding. He argued that even if he doubted everything else, he could not doubt his own existence (Cogito, ergo sum). The evil demon is a concept used to argue against the possibility of knowing anything with certainty, implying that there might be an entity causing illusions or deception, but this does not necessarily imply the existence of such a being. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'could possibly be deceiving him'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes's argument suggests that if God exists, then the possibility of an evil demon deceiving us must also exist, as God's omnipotence would allow for such a being. However, the statement does not directly indicate whether the evil demon is real or merely a possibility.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that virtue is a kind of excellence and that individuals can develop good habits through practice, which leads to virtue becoming innate. This means that virtues are acquired through habit, not through philosophical reflection alone.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's understanding of virtues aligns with the idea that they are innate qualities, present in individuals from birth and shaping their character. This view contrasts with the notion that virtues are acquired through habit or philosophical contemplation.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier's description of a foundational crisis in morality implies a fundamental challenge to the very foundations of moral philosophy and the underlying principles that guide moral decision-making. This typically involves questioning or reevaluating long-held beliefs about what is 'right' or 'wrong', which aligns with the concept of justified constraint, option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The moral system facing a crisis, as described by Gauthier, is essentially based on enlightened egoism, where individuals act in their own self-interest while considering the long-term consequences. This differs from pure altruism, which focuses solely on helping others without regard for personal gain.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. While providing all relevant information is ideal, it can be challenging due to time constraints and the need for privacy. Withholding certain details may be necessary, and participants might alter their behavior if they know the exact nature of the study. Thus, ensuring informed consent is a delicate balance between transparency and practicality.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main difficulty in ensuring informed consent lies in the impracticality of presenting participants with every single detail about the study, which could be overwhelming and unnecessary. Additionally, withholding certain information might be necessary to avoid influencing participant behavior, but also to protect sensitive details. Therefore, all of these reasons contribute to why it is challenging to ensure informed consent is given.",D

Stevenson aims to provide an account and establish what makes actions right, indicating that he wants to define morality and its sources, which aligns with developing a theory of good moral character.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson's primary goal in the paper is to establish a clear and objective account of what makes right actions right, providing a foundation for ethical decision-making. This aligns with his aim to 'make ethical questions clear', ensuring that individuals can understand and apply these principles in their lives.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. Feelings are essential to moral life as they provide a basis for ethical decision-making and guide individuals towards what is right or wrong. They are an inherent part of human nature and cannot be ignored when determining what is morally correct or incorrect.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Feelings play a vital role in ensuring impartiality within the moral life, as they allow us to connect with the experiences of others and understand their perspectives. This understanding is key to making ethical decisions that consider the well-being of all parties involved.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that the highest good for humans was a life of virtue, which includes both pleasure and happiness but also other virtues like wisdom and excellence. While there might be some disagreement about the exact nature of the highest good, Aristotle himself saw it as a complex combination of multiple factors, not just pleasure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While there might be some individual variations, there is no general agreement on the answer to the question of the highest good of human action, as different people prioritize different values and goals. This is a complex philosophical question that has been debated for centuries without reaching a consensus.",A

However, it is not unheard of, and can be a matter of personal preference or cultural context.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Singer, a philosopher, likely aligns with other philosophers who advocate for ethical principles in moral decision-making. Plato and Aristotle are ancient Greek philosophers known for their contributions to ethics, while Thomas Aquinas is a medieval Christian philosopher who integrated Aristotle's ideas into Christian theology. Immanuel Kant is a prominent Enlightenment philosopher known for his critical philosophy. Among these options, Kant's philosophical works are the most likely to align with Singer's ethical principles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's ethical framework, with its focus on universal principles and the equal consideration of interests, aligns closely with the deontological ethics of Immanuel Kant. Deontology emphasizes duty and respect for moral laws, which is a key aspect of Singer's ethical theory.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hare argues that moral judgments have two key features: universalizability (the ability to be applied to all relevant situations) and prescriptivity (providing a clear set of rules). These are the defining characteristics of deontological ethics, so the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The key features of the logic of moral judgments, as described by Hare, are consistency and coherence, ensuring that our moral principles are logically sound and free from contradictions. While these are not explicitly mentioned by name in the question, they are integral to Hare's theory.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to John Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, individuals who consent to form a political body and submit to a government agree to be bound by the decisions made by the majority, the rulers, or the laws established by the society they help create.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In Locke's view, individuals who consent to a government agree to submit to the decisions of judges, who interpret and enforce the laws of the society. This is because the role of the judiciary is to resolve disputes and enforce the rules that govern the political body.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic values refer to the subjective evaluation of beauty in art, which encompasses a range of objects and their perceived visual appeal. It involves the moral value judgment of what is considered beautiful or aesthetically pleasing.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic values primarily deal with the moral dimensions of art and other objects of beauty, considering their ethical implications and impact on society. So, the correct answer is option A.",A
A,Let's reason step by step. Act-utilitarianism is a moral theory that focuses on maximizing happiness and reducing suffering. It can lead to conflicting decisions when individuals act based on their immediate actions' consequences without considering broader implications or long-term effects. This can result in moral dilemmas where the right action is not immediately clear.,B,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's argument against act-utilitarianism highlights its numerous shortcomings, including self-contradictions, the creation of moral dilemmas, and implausible consequences. All three options are valid points that Brandt makes regarding this ethical theory.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Rawls, the 'initial position' is a hypothetical state in which individuals are behind a 'veil of ignorance', with limited knowledge and beliefs. This position is meant to be rational and impartial, hence the choice 'rational'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The initial position in Rawls' theory refers to the starting point of the thought experiment, where individuals would use logical reasoning to arrive at principles of justice. Therefore, the correct answer is 'rational'.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill argues that justice is a special type of moral obligation, which he distinguishes from other moral duties. He claims that justice involves perfect and absolute obligations, while other moral duties are either positive or negative, but not necessarily perfect or absolute.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill distinguishes justice from other moral obligations based on whether they involve positive actions we must perform or negative duties to avoid harm. This aligns with the distinction between positive and negative duties, where positive duties are actions we must take, and negative duties are duties to not do something harmful.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's theory suggests that true knowledge comes from recognizing ideal forms or essences, which are not found in the physical world but are understood through our innate senses and intellect. This implies that knowledge is innate as it is derived from a higher, unchanging source of understanding.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believes that our souls existed before birth and had knowledge of the Forms, which is then forgotten upon entering the world and needs to be triggered by experience. This suggests that knowledge is innate and not derived from sensory experiences alone.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Butler argues that compassionate behavior is a function of both the intensity of one's affection for others and their own personal character. This suggests that both factors contribute to compassionate actions, making it a combination of 'a' and 'b'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Butler, compassion is a powerful emotion that drives our actions, and the degree to which we act compassionately depends solely on the strength of this feeling. Thus, it is option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In Book II of the Republic, Glaucon argues that justice is a virtue inherent in the structure of society and emerges from the agreements and interactions within a just community. This suggests that justice originates from social agreement rather than being imposed by nature or divine beings.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glaucon argues that justice is not a natural phenomenon but rather a human construct, stemming from our inherent desire for self-preservation and the need to avoid suffering harm. He suggests that people agree on certain standards of justice to maintain social order, with this agreement being the foundation of justice in society.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argued that 'moral obligation' is not a meaningful concept as it does not refer to any external source of authority or rule, but rather is subjective and based on personal feelings or beliefs. Therefore, the correct answer is D: no real concept at all.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe argues that the concept of moral obligation has lost its meaning in modern society, as it is now simply a reflection of the prevailing social norms and expectations. This suggests that 'moral obligation' has become synonymous with societal expectations, rather than any inherent duty or command.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Moral luck is often associated with external circumstances beyond one's control, so living in a time of war or being involved in an accident are not something one can control. Envy and ungenerosity are more internal traits, so they are not considered constitutive moral luck.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bad constitutive moral luck refers to situations where individuals are born into environments or historical periods that negatively shape their moral character, such as living in Nazi Germany. While all options could be considered bad moral luck, only living during a time of great moral challenge and uncertainty would fall under constitutive moral luck.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's suggestion is in response to Meno's Paradox, which asks how knowledge can be innate or remembered if a person is born without any prior experience. This paradox challenges the very notion of pre-existing knowledge about the Forms, suggesting that it must be acquired through experience.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Meno's Paradox questions how we can remember knowledge of the Forms after being born into this world, as the shock of birth would erase all prior knowledge. Plato's response is that knowledge is innate and not acquired through experience, resolving the paradox by suggesting that knowledge is pre-existing within us.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's ethical theory was a comprehensive framework that aimed to provide universal principles for living a good life, but it was also open to interpretation and could be adapted to different contexts. It wasn't solely applicable to him personally, as he believed in the potential for everyone to achieve virtue.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's theory of virtues is deeply rooted in the specific cultural and societal norms of ancient Greece, making it difficult to apply universally across different cultures and time periods. His philosophy was relative to his context, and he believed that moral character was a central aspect of living a good life. Thus, his theory is best understood as being 'relative to his culture'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that ethical theories based on virtues are often associated with a shift towards relativism, as virtue ethics emphasizes individual character and context over abstract principles. This suggests that the correct answer is C: 'relativism'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that the shift towards virtue ethics represents a move towards absolute moral principles, emphasizing universal values and objective standards of right and wrong. This aligns with absolutism, which asserts absolute moral truths.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's theory suggests that knowledge goes beyond mere beliefs and opinions; it requires a true belief supported by a rationale or justification. The 'Divided Line' concept by Plato implies that knowledge is attained when our sensory experiences align with the world of eternal, unchanging Forms, which are the source of true understanding. So, the correct answer is A, as it emphasizes the foundation of knowledge in sensory experiences and their relationship to the world of becoming, which is in line with Plato's notion of knowledge being grounded in justification and rational understanding.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's Divided Line illustrates that knowledge is ultimately based on our individual beliefs and interpretations of the world, shaped by our experiences and upbringing. However, true knowledge goes beyond mere belief or opinion; it requires a justification or rationale, indicating that it is grounded in a deeper understanding of the Forms or concepts that are perceived as rationally ordered.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hume's philosophy suggests that reason is a capacity that comes before and enables action, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is the sole source of moral actions. It can be both the first impulse and not necessarily cool or disengaged.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume believes that reason plays a central role in guiding our moral actions, as it allows us to understand the consequences of our choices and make rational decisions. However, he also acknowledges that desire is the initial impulso that drives our actions, and these desires are shaped by our understanding of what is morally right or wrong.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of knowledge, including the nature and scope of knowledge, justifying beliefs, and the reliability of sources. Questions about what constitutes knowledge and truth fall within this field.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Questions about knowledge and truth fall under the domain of aesthetics, as they relate to our perception and understanding of beauty and artistic expression. These philosophical inquiries often delve into the nature of reality and how we interpret it through sensory experiences.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. An object can have aesthetic value if it serves a purpose beyond its functionality, and often captures the imagination or evokes an emotional response. This view suggests that beauty is subjective and lies in the eye of the beholder.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetic value is an inherently subjective and undefinable concept, as it varies greatly based on individual preferences and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, the correct answer is that it 'cannot be defined'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill's theory on pleasure and value suggests that we must look at the overall satisfaction or enjoyment that a particular pleasure brings to the greatest number of people, rather than focusing on subjective preferences or objective pleasure intensities.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill suggests that we can rely on scientific methods to objectively measure and compare the intensity and duration of different pleasures, thus determining their relative value. This approach eliminates subjective biases and allows for a more objective comparison.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Epicurus, a wise person accepts and embraces the natural cycle of life and death, recognizing that death is inevitable and often prefers to live a virtuous life to face death with dignity. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 'is unconcerned with death'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that the wise person recognizes the futility of life and actively seeks its end, as death represents the ultimate release from suffering. This choice aligns with Epicurean philosophy.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that people can and often do act in ways that are not entirely rational, contradicting the notion of a rational agent. Option D is thus incorrect as it defines a rational agent.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier argues that rational agents are primarily concerned with maximizing their own preferences and self-interest, even if it comes at the expense of others. This directly contradicts the idea that everyone will do better when they mutually constrain their pursuit of self-interest, as suggested in option C. Therefore, this is the correct answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aristotle's philosophy, the essence of a species is embodied in its individuals, so if all members of a species were to perish, their essence would also be destroyed as it is dependent on those individuals for existence.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle rejects the Platonic notion of Forms and argues that essences or forms do not exist independently of individual objects, suggesting that there are only particular things in the world. If all members of a species are destroyed, their essence is also destroyed as it is inherent in those individuals.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. When conducting research involving visual methods and public spaces, it is crucial to consider legal guidelines that protect individuals from potential harm and ensure their privacy. This ensures ethical research practices and responsible data handling.",D,"Let's reason step by step. When using visual methods, the primary concern should be understanding the legal boundaries of public spaces, as this determines what can be photographed or recorded. This includes considerations of privacy and potential harm to individuals. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's claim suggests that pursuing pleasure is not a sustainable path to happiness, so we can eliminate A and B. While forgetting about happiness may seem counterintuitive, it could be interpreted as letting go of attachment to the idea of happiness, which can lead to a more fulfilling life, thus C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg suggests that the best way to achieve happiness is to actively pursue pleasure and seek out enjoyable experiences. This is because pleasure provides a direct path to happiness, as it is the goal or end result we are striving for.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's argument is that knowledge of God's existence is a necessary truth, which he believes to be self-evident and unprovable or disprovable. This aligns with the statement 'is true but cannot be proven'.",B,Let's reason step by step. Augustine's extensive writings against Academic skepticism clearly demonstrate its validity and prove its central tenets. This makes option A the most plausible answer.,A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's claim suggests that hunger drives the desire to consume food, which aligns with the traditional understanding of hunger as a physiological state that prompts us to seek sustenance. This desire for food is the primary motivation behind eating, so desiring food is the most logical answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hunger is a physiological state that triggers a desire for specific sensory experiences, such as the taste and texture of food, rather than the food itself. Feinberg's claim suggests that people are motivated to seek out these sensory pleasures when hungry.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Moore, 'pleasure is good' essentially translates to 'pleasure is desired', as pleasure inherently carries a positive connotation and is generally sought after by individuals.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Moore's argument implies that the concept of 'good' cannot be reduced to mere pleasure, leading to the conclusion that we desire the act of desiring pleasure itself. This is most closely aligned with option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, when we seek moral advice, we are essentially asking others to share their values and preferences, which guides our decision-making process. This is because moral judgment involves evaluating actions based on shared norms and values.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When seeking moral advice, we essentially request guidance in the form of clear instructions on the appropriate course of action. This is represented by 'issue commands', as it implies giving directions or orders for someone to follow.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. In Aristotle's philosophy, 'incontinence' refers to the inability to control one's actions or emotions, particularly in the context of moral decisions. It implies a lack of self-control and the failure to act according to one's knowledge of what is right or wrong. Option A describes the concept accurately.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Incontinence, as described by Aristotle, refers to the ability to recognize and control one's emotions, preventing them from influencing actions. It is about knowing what is appropriate and acting accordingly. Option C describes this concept accurately.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, justice is achieved when the law is followed and those who break contracts or promises are held accountable. This option best represents his view as it emphasizes the rule of law and accountability, two key pillars of his justice theory.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ross's conception of justice aligns with the principle of upholding the law, ensuring that all rules and regulations are followed without exception. This option is reflected in choice A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Confidentiality of research participants' personal data is crucial to protect their privacy and prevent potential identity disclosure, which could lead to harm or stigma. This ensures that participants feel safe sharing sensitive information, knowing it will remain confidential.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Maintaining confidentiality in research allows researchers to delve deeper into participants' lives and gather more comprehensive data without their explicit knowledge. This can lead to more accurate findings, but also raises ethical concerns about privacy and consent. Additionally, it ensures that sensitive information is protected from potential harm if it falls into the wrong hands.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' theory, as outlined in his work 'A Theory of Justice', suggests that society should aim for equality of opportunity and treat individuals equally, regardless of their inherent characteristics like intelligence. In this case, students with fewer native assets (intelligence) would require more support to achieve equal opportunities, so they should be given more attention and resources.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls argues for a just distribution of resources, which implies providing equal support and opportunities to all students, regardless of their inherent abilities or disadvantages. This aligns with option A, as it suggests that students with fewer native assets should receive additional attention and resources to level the playing field.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The theory that mental states are identical to brain states is known as physicalism or materialism, which is a view in philosophy of mind and cognitive science. It asserts that mental phenomena are ultimately reducible to physical processes in the brain.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The theory suggesting that mental states are simply epiphenomena of brain activity, lacking any independent existence or causal power, is known as identity theory. It asserts that the mind and brain are one and the same entity, with mental states being mere reflections of physical brain states.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hare claims that these strategies can help one avoid moral arguments, which are often used to justify harmful actions. Option A states that none of them work, while the other options imply that some or all might be successful in avoiding such arguments.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hare acknowledges that certain methods of avoiding moral arguments can be effective in specific situations, allowing individuals to escape moral obligations without consequence. However, he also emphasizes the potential drawbacks or limitations of these strategies, suggesting that they may not always be successful in the long run.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The moral argument against imprisoning someone for a debt relies on the belief that all people are equal under the law and that no one should be punished without due process. This is a fundamental principle of justice and human rights, which is why considerations of universality and consequences are not necessary in this case.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The moral objection to imprisoning debtor A stems from the potential negative consequences, such as financial hardship and family separation, that such punishment would inflict. This is a specific argument based on the particular circumstances of the individual, making it distinct from a general fear or a universal principle.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The scripture Butler discusses emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans, portraying them as 'one body' with diverse parts, suggesting unity and interdependence rather than individual autonomy. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The scripture Butler references emphasizes the interconnectedness of all living beings, suggesting that humans are an integral part of the larger animal kingdom. This view aligns with the idea that we are a part of nature and not separate from it.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Locke, a prominent political philosopher, believed that the primary purpose of forming a commonwealth (a community with a body politic) was to protect individuals' natural rights and ensure peace and security, which is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke argues that individuals form commonwealths primarily to ensure the continuation of the state of nature, where natural rights and freedoms are protected. The correct answer is the 'preservation of the state of nature'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics, or the philosophy of art, is a field that invites input from anyone with an interest in beauty, taste, and the arts. It is not limited to philosophers alone but also includes critics and those who engage with philosophical inquiries about these topics.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics, as a branch of philosophy concerned with beauty and art, has little relevance or appeal to the general public and remains a specialized field of study. It is primarily of interest to philosophers who delve into these concepts.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The Socratic method is a form of inquiry characterized by asking a series of questions to stimulate critical thinking and uncover underlying assumptions or logical fallacies in an argument. It is a systematic approach to questioning, similar to how one might cross-examine a witness in a legal setting.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The Socratic method, characterized by its structured question-and-answer format and pursuit of truth, can be broadly categorized as a type of debate. While it is often used in educational settings to stimulate critical thinking, the Socratic method itself is not a form of jest or argumentation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Paley's argument, as presented in his Natural Theology, is that complex and specific structures in the natural world (like a watch) indicate design by an intelligent agent (God). The argument from design holds even for things like watches, which are complex and exhibit purpose and complexity. Thus, the correct answer is 'the works of nature'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Paley's argument implies that the intricate design found in both watches and natural phenomena is a product of time, gradually shaping and perfecting their mechanisms. This suggests that the intricate design in the watch is reflected in the works of nature, which can be understood through the lens of time.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, a philosopher and mathematician, proposed dualism, believing that the body and mind are separate entities. He suggested that the mind, or soul, interacts with the physical body through the pineal gland, located in the brain.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes believed that the interaction between the mind and body occurred through a mysterious substance called ectoplasm, located within the brain. This belief was influenced by his interest in dualism and the concept of a 'dual body'.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel argues that skeptical arguments often arise from inconsistent or arbitrary criteria, which can lead to a lack of clarity and understanding. This is particularly true when individuals apply their own personal standards without considering broader context or the views of others.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel's analysis of skepticism reveals that most skeptical arguments ultimately contradict themselves and fail to provide a coherent basis for doubt. This indicates that they are logically self-refuting, option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy emphasized ethical behavior and doing what is just, or 'kratos', which in this context means acting in a way that benefits oneself and those around them. If attempting to escape prison would be beneficial to Socrates and his friends, it would align with his philosophy of acting justly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates advises Crito that escaping prison is only justifiable if it serves his own best interests and improves his personal circumstances. This aligns with the principle of 'harmful to himself, beneficial to others', as it primarily benefits Socrates while potentially causing harm to those who oppose his freedom.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist philosopher, argued that if God does not exist, then there are no inherent moral values or absolute truths. In his view, humans create their own morality and purpose in the absence of divine guidance. This leads to the conclusion that, according to Sartre, if God does not exist, then anything is permissible, as there are no inherent moral constraints.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre's assertion that 'existence precedes essence' suggests that without God as the source of meaning and purpose, human existence itself becomes meaningless and void. This leads to the conclusion that with God non-existent, nothing inherently defines what is right or wrong, good or bad. However, it does not necessarily imply that 'anything is permissible'. While there are no inherent moral values dictating behavior, individuals can still recognize the importance of their actions through their own sense of conscience and societal norms.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's 'Divided Line' distinguishes between belief and knowledge, where knowledge is justified by reasons or justifications. This suggests that knowledge goes beyond mere sensory perception or opinion, appealing to a higher level of understanding based on rationality and the Forms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Plato's Divided Line emphasizes the importance of relying on our senses and observations to understand the world around us, as they provide the foundation for our beliefs and opinions. However, knowledge goes beyond mere belief or opinion; it requires justification and rational explanation. This suggests that we appeal to our senses and experiences (option A) to provide reasons and justifications for our beliefs about how things appear to us in the world.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A prima facie duty is a legal concept referring to an initial or first duty or obligation. It implies a strong but not necessarily conclusive indication of an obligation, similar to 'seems right'. The answer choice that best captures this idea is option A: 'seems to be right, although this might be illusory'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A prima facie duty implies that an action appears to be right at first glance, and therefore should be considered the correct course of action without further deliberation. This aligns with option A: 'seems to be right, although this might be illusory'.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aquinas, the ultimate goal or end of human existence is to achieve happiness or beatitude, which is a state of perfect peace and joy in God's presence. This is the highest good that humans can strive for.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that the ultimate goal of human life is to satisfy our desires and achieve a state of contentment and fulfillment through their realization. This state of happiness or beatitude, as it is sometimes called, is the end or purpose of human existence according to Aquinas' philosophy.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed that true happiness and peace of mind come from internal virtue and detachment from external things beyond our control. According to him, the only thing we truly own is our thoughts and actions, not material possessions or relationships. So, the correct answer is option A, as it reflects this idea of controlling one's impressions or perceptions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that our bodies are the only things truly under our control, as they are not subject to external influences or the whims of fate. Therefore, one can only truly own their actions and how they respond to their senses and emotions.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, a British philosopher, argued that pain and pleasure are the two fundamental motivators of human behavior. He believed that nature has provided humans with these two experiences as a form of guidance in our moral decision-making. Thus, the correct answer is option A: 'pain and pleasure'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's philosophy revolves around the idea that our actions are ultimately guided by the pursuit of good and the avoidance of evil, which serve as the fundamental motivators of human behavior. While pleasure and pain are a part of this dichotomy, they are not the sovereign masters as they are relative to individual perspectives and can be subjective. Good and evil, on the other hand, provide a more universal framework for moral decision-making.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative is a moral philosophy that suggests we should act according to principles that one could will as a universal law. In this case, the answer is C: a universal law.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that moral actions are those that can be applied as contingent laws, meaning they are dependent on specific circumstances and contexts. A 'contingent law' is a statement or principle that is true in some cases but not all, which aligns with the idea of an action being morally permissible depending on the situation.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill argues that a happy life involves both emotional excitement and tranquility, suggesting that a balanced mix of the two is key to a fulfilling existence. Thus, the correct answer is option C: 'both a and b'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Mill argued that a truly happy life is one that avoids both excessive tranquility and excitement, as these states can lead to stagnation and instability, respectively. Thus, a happy life lies in finding a balance between the two extremes.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is C as it acknowledges that factors outside an individual's control can influence their actions and moral assessment, which is a fundamental concept in ethical theory.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The control condition emphasizes the importance of respecting individual autonomy and refraining from attempting to control the actions or choices of others. It acknowledges that certain factors are beyond an individual's control, and thus, they cannot be held morally responsible for them. This aligns with the idea that one should not be blamed for circumstances beyond their control.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that for Aristotle, the reference of a virtue term is determined by its conventional use in language and social practices, rather than being defined by inherent qualities or essentialist descriptions. This view aligns with Aristotle's emphasis on practical wisdom and his belief in the importance of societal norms and conventions in shaping our understanding of moral virtues.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that Aristotle believed the meaning of virtue terms is determined by thick descriptions, which provide rich and detailed accounts of virtuous actions and character traits. This is in contrast to conventional use, grounding experiences, or tradition, which are less nuanced sources of reference.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to John Locke, a man in a state of nature would give up his absolute freedom for protection and security from the uncertainties and dangers present in such a state. The answer choice that aligns with this reasoning is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Locke believed that individuals willingly give up their absolute freedom in the state of nature to join a society where they can continue to enjoy the same level of freedom under the protection of the state. The answer is that he wants to have absolute power over others, as this would ensure his freedom and safety while also providing him with the means to enforce it.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Brandt's theory, an ideal moral rule would maximize overall utility, considering both positive and negative consequences. This is because a true moral rule should aim to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people, which involves weighing both pleasant and unpleasant outcomes.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's ideal moral rule prioritizes actions that maximize positive outcomes and benefits for individuals and society, even if they may involve some negative consequences. This theory values the overall benefit to the community over individual harm.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Hare refers to people who endorse ideals without considering the consequences or well-being of others as 'fanatics'. Fanatics are extreme in their beliefs and actions, often ignoring ethical considerations.",A,Let's reason step by step. Hare uses the term 'amoralist' to describe individuals who prioritize ideals and principles without considering the impact of their actions on the well-being and interests of others. This behavior is often associated with a disregard for moral norms and ethical considerations.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' philosophy emphasized the importance of virtue, which he believed was a form of knowledge. He argued that the 'holy' or divine was something that could be understood through rational inquiry and moral reflection.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that the concept of holiness is closely linked to beauty, as both represent ideals that inspire awe and reverence in individuals. Beauty, according to Socrates, is a form of goodness, and by extension, something holy. Thus, the correct answer is C: what is beautiful.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Rawls' theory, the principles of justice are chosen behind the veil of ignorance as a fair agreement or bargain among people with unknown positions in society. This ensures that the principles are not biased towards any particular group and promote equality.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' veil of ignorance, by removing knowledge of individual circumstances, results in principles of justice that are too abstract and idealistic to be effectively implemented in real-world situations. Thus, the correct answer is B: impractical.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument starts with the principle of equality, which is a fundamental ethical stance that all people have equal moral worth and rights. This assumption forms the basis for her subsequent arguments.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer's argument for alleviating suffering is based on the fundamental principle that all people are created equal and therefore deserve equal consideration and assistance, regardless of their circumstances. This assumption forms the foundation for the ethical framework she presents.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham believed that the principal purpose of moral rules is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. This leads to the conclusion that considerations of what brings about these states determine what we ought to do, as well as what we will do.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's principle of utility suggests that considerations of pain and pleasure primarily influence our future actions, as we naturally seek to maximize pleasure and minimize pain in our choices. This leads to the conclusion that it determines 'what we will do'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Art can have various formal characteristics, but one of the most important ones is its ability to evoke strong emotions in viewers or participants. This emotional response is often the intended effect and can be a powerful tool to convey messages or inspire people.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The most important formal characteristic of art is its ability to evoke strong emotions and connect with viewers on a deep and personal level, regardless of its structural or technical aspects. This is because art is often used as a means of expression and communication, and its power lies in its ability to stir something within the viewer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero believed that each person is born with a combination of innate virtues and vices, which are influenced by nature but also shaped by one's choices. This suggests that individuals have both good and evil tendencies, as they are influenced by their natural predispositions and personal decisions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero believed that every individual possesses two inherent characters: one that is virtuous and inclined towards good, and another that is vicious and prone to evil. These characters are a part of a person's nature, as per Cicero's philosophy.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's 'Ethics' is a philosophical treatise that primarily focuses on moral virtue and ethical theory, so it would be logical for him to segue into a discussion of aesthetics, which is closely tied to ethics and the pursuit of eudaimonia (flourishing).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aristotle's Ethics culminates in a discussion of natural science, as he believed that understanding the natural world is essential for achieving a virtuous and fulfilling life. This segues into a broader exploration of the relationship between human beings and the universe.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Brandt, Mill's view aligns closely with act-utilitarianism, as it focuses on the consequences of specific actions and their impact on well-being, rather than abstract moral rules or societal norms.",A,"Let's reason step by step. John Stuart Mill's ethical views closely resemble Kant's deontological ethics, as both emphasize the importance of universal moral principles and duties that guide our actions. Mill's concept of harm and his focus on consequences are similar to Kant's idea of a categorical imperative, which considers the duty to act according to a rule that one would want to become a universal law.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Rawls' theory, one can enter the original position through a thought experiment, not by leaving society or following a procedure, and it is not something one would 'forget' as it is a hypothetical construct. So, the correct answer is none of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To truly understand justice, we must remove ourselves from the existing social structure and rebuild it from the ground up. This is the only way to ensure a completely unbiased perspective, which is what Rawls aims for with his theory.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, a founder of utilitarianism, believed that an action's moral worth depends on its consequences. He argued that an action is right if it produces happiness and wrong if it produces suffering.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's focus on maximizing overall happiness suggests that neither the intentions behind actions nor their specific outcomes truly matter. Instead, he believed that an action's moral worth is determined by its contribution to the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Sartre's philosophy, 'existence precedes essence', meaning that human beings are defined by their actions and experiences rather than being predetermined by some essence or nature. This concept is often associated with the idea of freedom and choice. Therefore, the answer is 'man'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sartre's idea of creating one's own essence through choices points to future generations who will define themselves through their actions. This being is not God, as God would have a predetermined essence, and it is also not primitive or present man, as they are defined by their essences. Thus, the correct answer is 'future man'.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg argues that a good moral education should focus on intrinsic rewards and not rely on external factors like pleasure or pain as incentives. This aligns with option A, which states that a good moral education will make no use of pleasure or pain as sanctions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A truly effective moral education, as Feinberg suggests, avoids using pleasure or pain as motivators for ethical behavior. This approach fosters intrinsic motivation and a sense of integrity, leading to individuals who act morally because they understand the inherent value of doing so, not out of fear or desire for external rewards.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe criticizes Kant's notion of the 'thing in itself', which is a fundamental concept in his philosophy, as being an unattainable and nonsensical idea that contradicts our everyday understanding of reality.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe likely found fault with Kant's notion of the thing-in-itself, as it posits an unknowable reality beyond our experience. This critique targets the very foundation of Kant's epistemology and ontological claims about the nature of reality.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' wisdom lies in his recognition of his own ignorance regarding certain concepts like justice, which he admits is rationally unjustified without knowledge. This suggests that his wisdom stems from acknowledging the limits of one's knowledge and understanding, rather than claiming knowledge or expertise in areas he lacks insight into. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' wisdom lies in his constant questioning of his own methods for seeking knowledge, acknowledging the potential flaws in his approach. He recognizes that seeking knowledge about 'essences' is challenging because it requires knowing what you are looking for beforehand, which is a paradox. This self-awareness and acceptance of ignorance is a key aspect of his philosophy.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, a rule can be considered ethical if it is not harmful, does not impose unnecessary restrictions, and promotes the good for some individuals. This aligns with utilitarianism, which aims to maximize happiness/good for the greatest number of people.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a rule to truly benefit humanity, as Baier suggests, it must first and foremost avoid causing any harm or detriment to individuals or society. Additionally, such a rule should not unduly restrict personal freedoms or impose burdens that outweigh the potential benefits. Finally, it is beneficial if the rule promotes the well-being of some individuals or the greater good. Thus, the correct answer is D, as all three conditions must be met.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Soft determinism asserts that while our actions are determined by prior causes, we still have the freedom to choose our desires and goals, which can influence our future actions. This view takes into account both determinism and free will.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Soft determinism implies that while our actions are ultimately determined, we still retain the freedom to choose and shape our own desires. This view acknowledges a degree of agency despite the underlying determinism.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's claim suggests that fear is influenced by cultural factors and can vary across different societies, indicating that it is not a universal experience. This contradicts the idea of a 'universally experienced' emotion.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum's work likely highlights the universality of fear, suggesting that it is experienced similarly across all cultures and societies. This contradicts the claim that it is 'partially learned and culturally variant' or that it is absent in certain societies.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg's theory suggests that pleasure is a fundamental human motivation and that we are inherently driven to seek out rewards and avoid pain. This aligns with the idea of psychological egoism, which states that individuals are primarily motivated by their own interests. Thus, feeling pleasure when we get what we want supports the notion that our actions are driven by self-interest.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The fact that we experience pleasure when our desires are fulfilled directly supports the idea of psychological egoism, as it demonstrates our inherent self-interest. This is a key tenet of the theory.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's deontological ethical theory holds that moral worth depends on the 'maxim' or rule behind an action, and whether it can be universally applied. The agent's character is relevant but secondary to the principle of the action itself.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's ethical framework suggests that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcomes and the overall consequences it produces. This aligns with option B, considering the 'consequences' of an action are a key factor in Kant's ethical theory.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher, suggests that the belief that moral actions are relative to cultural norms or personal convenience is more harmful than any other doctrine as it can lead to a lack of ethical foundation for society and individual decision-making.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero's strong stance against lying stems from the belief that it undermines trust and disrupts the social fabric. Lying, in his view, is a form of self-deception and a denial of one's true nature. This option indicates the closest match to Cicero's ethical stance on lying.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Hobbes, in his work 'Leviathan', argued that in the absence of a higher power to maintain order and fear, humans would be in a constant state of conflict as they pursue their individual interests without regard for others. This leads to a 'war of every man against every man'.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes likely believed that without a governing authority, humans would naturally coexist in a state of peace and cooperation. However, the absence of a common power to maintain order and prevent conflict leads to the 'war of every man against every man', as individuals would pursue their own self-interest without regard for others.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Prima facie duties are often learned through observing and understanding general principles that underpin specific actions, rather than the other way around. While philosophy can provide insight, it is not typically how one learns moral lessons in a practical sense. Explicit instruction is also not as common a method of learning moral duties, especially for adults. The correct answer is option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Ross, our understanding of prima facie duties comes from general ethical principles that guide our judgment of specific actions. This aligns with option B, which states that we infer the rightness of particular acts based on apprehended general principles.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Socrates, an unexamined life is one in which one does not question their beliefs and values, leading to a lack of self-knowledge and the potential for harmful actions without awareness or reflection. Therefore, the correct answer is 'the soul', as it represents one's inner being and the absence of self-examination can lead to detrimental actions driven by unquestioned desires or beliefs.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' emphasis on self-examination stems from his belief that an unexamined life ultimately harms the state and undermines its stability. This is because a person who does not question their beliefs and actions contributes to societal injustice and a lack of virtue, which are detrimental to the collective well-being and justice sought by a healthy society.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley argues that only what exists if it is perceived to exist, and since sensible things are not perceived as existing in a mind or an immaterial state, they cannot truly exist. So, the correct answer is 'a mind'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley's philosophy suggests that the existence of sensible things relies on their presence within a material substance, independent of the mind. Thus, only immaterial concepts like numbers and mathematical entities cannot exist in absolute existence or as material substances.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' 'Original Position' is a thought experiment where individuals choose principles for society without knowing their position, wealth, or capabilities. They would likely reject utilitarianism as it involves doing what is 'right', not just what leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number. This is because they don't know who those people are and may include themselves in the 'less fortunate'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the parties in the original position are behind the veil of ignorance, they would have no knowledge of utilitarianism and therefore wouldn't consider it. This leaves us with option D as the correct answer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes' conception of felicity, or happiness, is a complex idea in his philosophical work, 'Leviathan'. He describes it as a state of being free from pain and the absence of desire for anything else, which is a form of tranquility. This is in contrast to the continual pursuit of desires described in option B.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes likely viewed felicity as a state of deep contemplation and reflection, where desires and external pursuits are minimized. This is because he believed that the pursuit of happiness through external goods was illusory and that true contentment comes from within.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aristotle, ethical inquiry should start with identifying the intrinsic values that are important and valuable in themselves, rather than merely as a means to an end. This is the foundation for understanding what is morally right or wrong.",A,Let's reason step by step. Aristotle believed that ethical inquiry should begin by establishing our fundamental duties and obligations as humans. This is because he believed that these duties form the basis of moral behavior and guide us in determining what actions are right or wrong.,C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy is a field of inquiry that delves into the fundamental nature of knowledge, existence, truth, values, reason, mind, and language. It explores abstract concepts and seeks to understand the underlying principles that govern our understanding of the world and our place in it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy delves into the reasons why certain questions remain perpetually unanswered and lack definitive solutions. It explores the nature of knowledge, truth, existence, and reality, which are fundamental yet complex concepts that cannot be easily proven or disproven through scientific experimentation.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Brandt, utilitarianism holds that rightness is determined by the consequences of actions. This view is often referred to as 'consequentialist' ethics, where the outcome or consequence of an action is the primary factor in determining its moral worth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Utilitarianism, as I understand it, is all about maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering, so it makes sense that Brandt would focus on the consequences of particular acts to determine what's right. This is because those consequences will have an impact on happiness and suffering for individuals or groups.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant proposed that the supreme moral principle is 'categorical imperative', which is an a priori concept. It means that moral duties are universal and independent of consequences, so it fits best with 'analytic and a priori'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that moral laws are universal and apply to everyone, regardless of their individual experiences, so the supreme principle must be based on observation and experience, making it 'a posteriori'. It also needs to be synthetic, as it goes beyond mere knowledge and involves understanding, thus, it should be 'synthetic'. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Feinberg argues that most arguments for psychological egoism are based on self-report data, which is a type of qualitative research method often used in interviews and surveys. This method relies on individuals' subjective reports and experiences, rather than objective measurements or controlled experiments.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To understand how people behave, we need to conduct studies and gather data, so Feinberg's claim about psychological egoism must be based on controlled studies and observations. Interviews and surveys are a form of qualitative research that can provide insights but may not always lead to empirical evidence.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy asserts that moral laws are universal and necessary, applicable to all rational beings regardless of cultural context or personal beliefs. This aligns with option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Kant believed that morality is based on reason, and since only humans possess reason, moral laws must be contingent and apply solely to human beings. This makes option B the correct answer.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's philosophy suggests that while we strive for moral perfection, we can never achieve it completely. We can only fall short due to ignorance, wickedness, or temptation. Thus, the correct answer is that we can err, but not in any circumstances whatsoever.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine, being a religious philosopher, would likely attribute errors to moral failings and wickedness, suggesting that we only err when we choose to do wrong. Ignorance or temptation are not considered excuses for error in his philosophy.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Deceptive research practices can lead to a loss of trust in the researcher and their field, potentially damaging their reputation and the discipline as a whole. This is an important ethical consideration, as it could hinder future research and the progress of scientific knowledge.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Deceiving participants might not be the best practice, but it doesn't really cause any harm beyond making the researcher look a bit dishonest, so it's not a major ethical issue. The other options are more significant concerns as they could lead to issues with data privacy and research integrity.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Cicero, immorality is 'repugnant to Nature', while expediency is in accord with it. This means that immorality goes against the natural order or principles, while expediency aligns with them.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Immorality is clearly something that goes against our natural inclinations and what's best for us, while expediency, or doing what's practical, is more in line with our natural instincts. So, the correct answer is that immorality is 'repugnant to Nature', and expediency is 'in accord with Nature'.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Hume, reason should be used to direct our passions, not serve them or extinguish them. This is because passion without direction can lead to impulsive and detrimental actions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Reason is our ability to think logically and make sound judgments, so it should operate completely separately from our passions and emotions, which can cloud our judgment. Hume believed that reason is the master of passion, not its slave.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Taurek's statement suggests that the loss of two individuals can sometimes be 'less bad' than the loss of one, indicating a nuanced perspective on grief and loss, which contradicts the absolute statement in option A. Option B captures this idea.",B,"Let's reason step by step. It's a basic principle that losing two lives is always a greater tragedy than losing one, so Taurek must be arguing that the death of two people is always worse than the death of one. Option A accurately represents this argument.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Interest theories define goodness in terms of the satisfaction of desires and approval from others, which aligns with options A and C. While benefits to oneself is a part of option B, it doesn't capture the full extent of interest theory. Prima facie duties, as mentioned in option D, refer to moral obligations that are independent of consequences, so it's not a correct representation either.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Interest theories, as the name suggests, focus on what's in our best interest, so they must define goodness in terms of what benefits us personally. This leaves us with option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The notion of 'meaning in life' typically refers to the purpose or significance that individuals seek in their existence, which can be found in various forms such as personal values, relationships, achievements, or a connection to something larger than oneself. It often involves finding fulfillment and understanding one's place in the world.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The meaning of life is something we search for outside ourselves, in the grand scheme of things and our place in the universe, so it must refer to external meaning. ",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Psychological egoism is a theory that explains how individuals should act based on their self-interest, which is a generalization about human behavior. It is a claim about human nature and how people are capable of behaving.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Psychological egoism is simply the observation that people tend to act in their own self-interest most of the time, so it's a generalization about how people typically behave. It doesn't provide ethical guidelines on what we 'ought' to do.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, a philosopher, is known for his famous quote, 'I think, therefore I am', which asserts the existence of one's own mind and thought as the foundation of all knowledge. He argues that even if one doubts everything else, one cannot doubt their own thinking, thus declaring himself as 'a thing that thinks'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes is known for his skepticism and questioning everything, so his declaration that he is 'a thing that cannot exist' must be a way of expressing his doubt about his own existence. This is often referred to as the 'Cogito, ergo sum', which means 'I think, therefore I am'.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The view that we are composed of a physical body and an immaterial mind is known as substance dualism, which posits two distinct substances interacting.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Materialism is the view that everything is made of matter, including the mind, so it must be the theory that explains how the body and mind interact as two distinct substances. ",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Craig's argument against an infinite past implies that the universe had a beginning, which rules out option B. The statement suggests that the universe has a cause, which contradicts option C. While the universe may exist in the mind (option D), it doesn't provide a logical contradiction like options B and C do.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the series of events in time cannot be infinite, then the universe must be a mental construct, existing only within our minds, as Craig suggests. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates' famous claim, 'The unexamined life is not worth living', aligns with his belief that virtue (excellence of character) is knowledge. This is because questioning and examining one's beliefs and existence leads to self-knowledge and a life guided by wisdom. Option A captures this idea well.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates was known for his wisdom and for claiming to know nothing, so his belief that 'the unexamined life is not worth living' must be related to his own experience of questioning everything and seeking knowledge. This leads to the conclusion that he believed self-examination and the pursuit of knowledge are essential for a meaningful life.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement 'an infinite number of things' suggests an abundance or multitude, implying that there is no limit to the quantity being discussed. This contradicts the concept of infinity, which represents an uncountably infinite amount that cannot be counted or measured in a finite manner.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Infinity is a complex concept, but it's certainly possible to imagine an endless series of things, so Craig must believe that an actually infinite number of things is possible, even if we can't fully comprehend it. The other options are false because 'is meaningless' and 'cannot exist' contradict the idea of infinity, and 'exists somewhere' doesn't fit with the context of the sentence.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson refers to the concept of 'term' as having a specific meaning or reference, which aligns with option A. The definition suggests that a term is associated with empirical observations, indicating its practical and observable nature.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The meaning of a word is influenced by all the psychological factors surrounding its use, including the speaker's intentions, the listener's interpretation, and the emotional responses it evokes, so Stevenson must identify meaning with all these psychological causes and effects. ",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Rawls' 'original position' is a thought experiment in political philosophy, where he proposes that individuals agree to a social contract without knowing their position in society or their capabilities. This leads to the concept of a just distribution of resources and rights within a fair society, which is what Rawls aims to establish with his theory.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The original contract, as Rawls describes it, is a hypothetical agreement that establishes the foundation of morality and how we should live together, so it must be about establishing the content of morality as a whole. While society and government are part of the broader context, they are not what the contract itself is about.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's ethical theory, known as deontological ethics, suggests that the concept of 'good' is not inherent in actions but rather in the intention behind them. According to Kant, a good action comes from a good will, and consequences are not the defining factor. So, the answer is a good will.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The ultimate goal of morality is to achieve happiness and well-being, so Kant must believe that nothing can be called 'good' without qualification except happiness. This is because 'goodness' is a relative concept and depends on the consequences or the will behind an action.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Ideal Moral Code theory, proposed by John Rawls, suggests that individuals are obligated to act according to the moral rules that would be chosen by a rational agent in an ideal situation where everyone follows these rules perfectly. This theory emphasizes the importance of institutions in shaping moral behavior.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The ideal moral code refers to a situation where everyone follows the rules perfectly, so it's about how things should be in an ideal world. This is option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, a Roman philosopher, believed that living in accordance with nature and following one's conscience are key to moral conduct. He saw laws as tools to help us align with nature, but they should not be the primary guide. Religious edicts, on the other hand, might conflict with our natural state and so are not ideal either.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero believed that morality comes from within, so following our conscience would ensure we never stray from the right path. Following the laws and religious edicts are external sources of guidance, while 'Nature' could be interpreted in various ways and may not always align with moral principles.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's philosophy suggests that love and good are present when there is no evil. Evil, according to him, is the absence of good, so where there is no evil, there must be an abundance of good, which includes love.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed that evil arises from a lack of positive qualities, so where there's no hatred or negativity, there can be no evil. Love is a positive quality, so the absence of love would lead to an absence of evil according to this logic.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel's argument revolves around the idea of moral responsibility and the ability to judge character. He argues that people cannot be morally assessed for their actions that are beyond their control or those that only affect themselves, as these factors may preclude a full understanding of an individual's character.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel suggests that people shouldn't be judged for their inherent character traits before reflection, as these are part of who they are. This implies that actions and behaviors that don't involve violating others' rights or affecting them directly should not be a basis for moral assessment.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Cicero, in his work 'On the Commonwealth', uses the story of Icarus to illustrate the dangers of unchecked power and hubris, where one tries to act without regard for moral boundaries or consequences. The story of Icarus serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of overconfidence and the abuse of power.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The story Cicero uses to illustrate injustice with impunity must involve a conflict of power and morality, like the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon. This is because the ring in question gives its wearer invisibility, which can be used for both good or evil purposes.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson argues that empirical methods can be useful in moral philosophy when dealing with ethical disagreements, but they are not a guarantee of resolution or always applicable. While they can provide valuable insights, they may not always lead to a consensus.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Stevenson believed that empirical methods provide the most reliable way to settle ethical disputes, as they rely on objective evidence and observation. While they may not always be sufficient or applicable to all ethical dilemmas, they are a crucial tool in resolving disagreements based on facts and observable data.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, believed that ethical actions should maximize happiness for the greatest number of people. He proposed that utilitarian calculations are necessary to determine the rightness or wrongness of an action, and these calculations should be performed before taking any action. This aligns with choice A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's utilitarianism requires us to calculate the potential outcomes of each action before we act to ensure we maximize happiness. This suggests that option A is correct, as it emphasizes the necessity of these calculations prior to any action.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The biblical account of the soul is at odds with a unitary concept of the soul, which asserts that there is only one substance or nature of the soul. This contradicts the biblical belief in an immortal and distinct soul separate from the body.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Bible presents the soul as a single, indivisible entity, which contradicts the idea of a soul separate from the body. This is in contrast to the 'soul-body dualism' concept, where the soul and the body are seen as distinct entities.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Wolf, a moral saint is someone who leads a life that is free from any form of vice or immorality. This includes refraining from activities such as reading Victorian novels (as they may contain themes or language that is considered immoral), not having sarcastic wit (which can be seen as a form of deception) and not having an interest in gourmet cooking (as it might involve the consumption of expensive and indulgent foods).",D,"Let's reason step by step. A moral saint, as described by Wolf, is completely devoted to morality and wouldn't engage in frivolous activities like reading novels. They also lack sarcasm, which is often associated with witty humor. Their interests are likely to be more focused on meaningful pursuits like charity work or spiritual development.",D
B,Let's reason step by step. The idea that mental states are dispositions to behave in particular ways in certain circumstances is known as functionalism.,A,"Let's reason step by step. The idea that mental states are linked to observable behaviors is central to methodological behaviorism, which focuses on external actions. This theory differs from logical behaviorism and eliminative materialism, as they have distinct approaches to understanding the mind-body problem.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Immanuel Kant's moral philosophy, as outlined in his work 'Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals', revolves around the idea of duty and universal laws. He believed that moral worth is derived from the intention behind an action, not just its consequences. Option B captures this idea well: acting according to principles that one would want to see universally adopted.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Kant's moral philosophy emphasizes maximizing happiness for everyone, so we should choose actions that lead to the greatest overall good. However, this option is too vague and may lead to individualistic actions that don't consider others. The second option specifically mentions universal laws, which are essential in ensuring consistency and fairness in our actions. This choice also considers the consequences of our actions on a larger scale. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates believed that self-examination was crucial for living a virtuous life. If one doesn't examine their life and actions, they cannot know if their choices are aligned with virtue, as virtue is knowledge of the good. Therefore, an unexamined life cannot be virtuous.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates, being a philosopher, believed that those who engaged in philosophical reflection were naturally more virtuous than others. He argued that living an unexamined life, without questioning one's actions and principles, could not lead to a virtuous life. This is because virtue, according to Socrates, comes from knowledge and self-examination. If one does not know why they should act virtuously, they cannot truly understand the nature of virtue and thus cannot live a virtuous life.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Bentham, moral sanction refers to the pleasure or pain inflicted by a judge in accordance with established rules or laws, not just by chance members of the community or that which is permissible to inflict.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham defined moral sanctions as the punishments or rewards given by a judge based on the laws of the society. These are designed to be applied in accordance with these laws and serve as a means of social control. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Writers may have differing views on what constitutes acceptable research practices, leading to ongoing debates. These debates are often repeated as new ethical dilemmas emerge over time. Additionally, certain research methods are frequently associated with ethical concerns, such as issues of consent or animal welfare.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The main frustration in research ethics is that writers often have different opinions on what's considered ethical, leading to ongoing debates.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato is discussing how hypotheses in knowledge are not sufficient on their own as they do not provide a secure foundation for understanding the world. He argues that dialectical reasoning, which seeks to understand through logical argument and inquiry, is superior as it leads to true knowledge by eliminating these hypotheses and arriving at the 'first principle'. This indicates that hypotheses are used to explain sense experiences but fall short of providing a solid foundation, hence option A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plato believed that hypotheses help us connect our sense experiences with innate ideas, but they don't provide a secure foundation for knowledge. Instead, he advocated for dialectical methods, which aim to eliminate hypotheses and arrive at the 'absolute good' through pure intelligence.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Prima facie duty refers to an initial or first impression, and Ross compares it to the way natural laws and the laws of a nation are understood at first glance without further examination. This analogy suggests that prima facie duty is something that is initially perceived as an obligation but may require further analysis.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Ross compared prima facie duties to the laws of a country, which provide a basic framework for moral obligations but can be overridden in certain situations. This is similar to how prima facie duties are not absolute and can be modified or overcome under specific circumstances.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, genuine moral rules should be directed towards promoting the good for all sentient beings, which includes taking into account their interests. This excludes option D as it only focuses on self-interest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Baier argued that true moral rules consider the well-being of all living things, not just humans, as all life has inherent value. This aligns with option C: 'must take into account the interests of all living beings'.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill argues that one of the main criticisms of utilitarianism is the issue of 'supererogatory' actions, which are actions done beyond what is expected or required, but not necessarily for a specific moral reason. These actions can confuse the calculation of utility and are thus seen as an objection to the theory.",D,"Let's reason step by step. One of the main criticisms of utilitarianism is that it doesn't account for supererogatory actions, which go above and beyond what's morally expected. Mill's objection is specifically directed at this concept, making 'supererogation' the correct choice.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes, a philosopher, argued that the primary characteristic of physical objects is their extension or size, which can be measured and observed in the physical world.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes believed that physical things, unlike mental things, cannot be measured or quantified because they lack clear boundaries. This is a key aspect of his dualism philosophy, where he separated the mind (mental) from the body (physical).",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley, a philosopher, argued that the only things that truly exist are mental phenomena and that physical objects are merely illusions. He believed that our perception of the physical world is not reliable as it is shaped by our minds. Therefore, heat and cold, being sensations, are examples of something existing only in our minds.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Berkeley believed that reality is ultimately mental, so sensations like heat and cold must be illusions created by our minds. Therefore, according to Berkeley, they are not physical objects or things existing apart from our minds.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes' social contract theory suggests that people naturally seek peace and security, which can be achieved through the establishment of laws that prevent harm and promote cooperation. The precept mentioned here is a summary of this idea, emphasizing mutual respect and non-harm.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hobbes believed that individuals act in their self-interest, so the guiding principle of natural law would be to maximize happiness for oneself and society. The other options are not direct translations of his concept of 'maximizing happiness'.",A
B,Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that aid organizations have a more efficient system in place for delivering relief to distant refugees compared to close neighbors. This is likely due to the challenges of logistics and accessibility faced when trying to reach nearby communities in need.,A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues for effective altruism, so he likely believes that donating to distant refugees through organizations is inefficient and not worthwhile compared to helping those closer to home. However, he also acknowledges the value of these organizations as they can still make a difference despite their inefficiency.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. René Descartes' famous argument, known as 'Cogito, ergo sum', translates to 'I think, therefore I am'. This statement is a form of philosophical solipsism, suggesting that the very act of thinking or knowing one's existence is proof of one's existence. Therefore, Descartes concludes that his thoughts and existence are not being deceived or part of a dream, but rather, they are real.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Descartes famously doubted everything, even his own senses. Therefore, the fact that he is thinking could simply mean he is dreaming. However, if he is dreaming, then it also means he exists in a dream state, which contradicts his initial assumption of non-existence.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy relies on the idea that one can understand and explain the world through logic and reasoning. By accepting this premise, philosophy inherently accepts a certain level of mythos as a means to an end, as myths are often used to explain complex concepts in a more accessible way. This is especially true for ancient philosophical traditions that relied heavily on stories and narratives to convey their ideas.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophers often try to appear more credible by using complex language and obscure references. This reliance on mythos is essentially a way to disguise their lack of concrete evidence. While philosophy may not directly rely on logos, it often tries to present itself as if it did, especially when dealing with abstract concepts.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of art, beauty, and taste. It is a subjective field that values the visual and sensory qualities of an object, rather than its functionality or intrinsic value. Therefore, it is safe to say that aesthetics focuses on objects that are appreciated for their sensory appeal, which could be considered 'unessential' in a literal sense.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Aesthetics deals with beauty and art, which are fundamental to human expression, cultural development, and our understanding of the world. Therefore, aesthetics deals with objects essential to our existence. ",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argued that beauty is not an intrinsic property of objects but rather something that is perceived and interpreted by the observer. He believed that our perception of beauty is shaped by cultural norms, personal taste, and the play of imagination, rather than being based on any objective or universal standard. Thus, the correct answer is option A: 'a quality in things themselves'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Beauty is not arbitrary; there are clear criteria and principles that determine what is considered beautiful, such as symmetry, proportion, and harmony. Therefore, beauty can be judged by logical standards. ",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The question prompts us to reflect on our values and beliefs, encouraging introspection and self-examination. It invites us to consider what we hold dear and are willing to fight or die for, which can reveal our core principles and motivations. This introspection is a philosophical endeavor as it delves into the realm of ethics and personal values.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The question of dying for something is deeply personal and varies widely based on individual beliefs and values. Therefore, it cannot be a truly philosophical question as it doesn't have a single, universally applicable answer. Instead, it prompts individuals to reflect on their core convictions and actions.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. If one's perception of the world is limited to an internal perspective, then it becomes impossible to verify the accuracy or value of that perspective from an external, objective source. This is because the very nature of an 'internal' perspective means it exists separate from any external reality, and thus cannot be directly compared to a 'real' world for validation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If we are limited to an internal perspective, we can only compare our perceptions to the ""real"" world to determine their accuracy. Without an external reference point, we cannot judge the usefulness or truth of our perspective. Therefore, it is true that we cannot know if our internal perspective is useful, true, or valuable without comparing it to an external, objective reality.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe criticizes Butler for her argument that women should have the right to choose their own course of action without external influence or legislation. She argues that this notion is absurd and that our consciences, which guide our choices, are fallible and subjective. This critique highlights a key difference in their philosophical stances on individual autonomy and the role of conscience in moral decision-making.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Anscombe likely disagreed with Butler's emphasis on pleasure as a guiding principle for morality, arguing that the concept of pleasure is subjective and unreliable. This leads to the conclusion that C is the most probable answer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that myth, which is a form of storytelling and tradition, is not based on rational explanations but on revealing relationships and connections. This implies that mythos, being the foundation of myth, also relies on reasoning or thinking, as it provides the framework for understanding and interpreting stories and traditions. Thus, the correct answer is A: 'mythos is ultimately based on logos, just as myth is ultimately based on reasoning or thinking.'",A,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that myth and reason are essentially the same thing, with each concept defining and shaping the other in a cyclical manner. This implies that mythos, as a form of storytelling and tradition, is inherently tied to logos, or reasoning, even if it doesn't explicitly explain relationships but rather reveals them. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Practical rationality is the application of rational thinking to practical matters and decision-making. Gauthier's claim suggests that rationality has no other purpose or scope beyond this practical aspect, implying that moral justification, deliberative processes, and epistemic considerations are not part of what he considers rationality to be.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Gauthier likely believes that practical rationality is ultimately grounded in moral principles, as our actions should be guided by ethical considerations and a sense of right and wrong. This aligns with the idea that practical rationality finds its justification in moral justification.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Thomas Aquinas, a prominent Christian philosopher, argued that human actions are driven by the pursuit of happiness or pleasure, which he saw as a means to achieve an end state of perfection and union with God. So, the correct answer is C: pleasing God.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that individuals are naturally inclined to act in their self-interest, seeking to maximize their own well-being and happiness as the ultimate end of their actions. This is often referred to as the 'teleological argument', suggesting that all agents have a final cause or purpose in their actions, which aligns with self-interest.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. In the context of Socrates' philosophy, the soul is believed to be harmed when it lacks knowledge and understanding. This is because Socrates held that knowledge is essential for virtue and a good life. So, the correct answer is 'knowledge'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Socrates emphasized the importance of self-reflection and individual pursuit of knowledge. He likely believed that excessive involvement in community affairs could distract from this pursuit and harm the soul. Therefore, 'knowledge' is the correct answer.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Art is often seen as a form of human expression and creativity, which is distinct from mere utility or wealth. While art can be a way to convey messages or serve a practical purpose, it is its own unique realm, separate from mere functionality or material gain.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Art has historically served various purposes, such as communication, education, and even religious or political propaganda. Therefore, its traditional definition likely emphasizes its utility and practical function in society. Thus, the correct answer is 'utility'.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Nussbaum argues that contemporary debates about homosexuality can be traced back to ancient Greek discussions on the subject, indicating a continuity in the topic's relevance and significance throughout history. This suggests that the debate is not merely about moral or ethical principles but rather a recurring question with deep cultural and historical roots.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the long history of philosophical and ethical discussions on sexuality, our modern debates about homosexuality are likely continuations of the same arguments and concerns present in ancient Greek society. This suggests that option A is the most accurate statement.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Bentham, the principle of utility is appropriately applied to both individuals and governments as it aims to maximize happiness for the greatest number of people, which can be achieved through policies and laws that benefit the many.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's principle of utility focuses on maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. This suggests its application is primarily relevant to governments and policymakers who make decisions affecting large populations. Therefore, the correct answer is B: governments.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aquinas, an action is driven by a desire and aims towards achieving some good or pleasure. Therefore, the end of an action is what fulfills that desire and brings about the desired pleasure or good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas believed that human actions are driven by desires and emotions. Therefore, the ultimate end of every action is likely an emotional state, such as happiness, satisfaction, or peace. This aligns with the idea that we take actions to achieve a desired outcome and experience pleasure or joy from it.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Nagel argues that moral luck, which is the claim that our moral actions are influenced by factors beyond our control, is closely tied to the concept of free will. This is because if we cannot control the circumstances that influence our moral choices, then it is difficult to justify moral blame or praise.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The problem of moral luck deals with the influence of external factors on our moral responsibility. This is closely related to the problem of universals, as it questions whether there are universal moral principles applicable to all situations. Nagel suggests that moral luck, which challenges our sense of moral responsibility, may be linked to the existence of such universals.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine's philosophy suggests that all things are inherently good and part of God's creation, and thus have a divine nature. This includes both the whole and its parts, implying that each thing is good in itself, not just when combined with others.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Augustine believed in a benevolent God who created a perfect world. Therefore, all created things must be eternally and unchangeably good, reflecting the divine nature of their origin. This is a fundamental tenet of Christian theology, often referred to as 'teleological argument'.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham was a philosopher who proposed the utilitarianism ethical theory, which states that an action is morally right if it maximizes happiness for the greatest number of people. His views suggest that morality and God's will are separate concepts, as he believed in maximizing happiness regardless of religious beliefs. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's focus on maximizing happiness suggests that morality is independent of religious beliefs, implying that God's will and moral rightness are separate domains. This aligns with option A, as it emphasizes knowing the nature of an action before determining its moral worth.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In the state of nature, according to Hobbes, people have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. In a state of war where everyone is against everyone, one's natural right to self-preservation and defense takes precedence over others' rights, thus justifying the right to defend oneself and acquire property.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In a state of war, there's an absence of governing authority, but individuals still retain inherent rights, such as the right to lawful treatment and protection from harm. This is because natural rights are not derived from societal agreements but are instead believed to be inherent in all people.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that true happiness and a good life could be achieved by living modestly, avoiding pleasure-seeking, and focusing on friendship and virtue. According to him, wealth was necessary but not sufficient for a good life, which could be achieved through self-control and virtuous living.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus believed that true happiness comes from simple pleasures, but attaining these pleasures often requires hard work and dedication, making a good life accessible only through great effort. This is in line with option B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit argues that the magnitude of pain can be measured and compared quantitatively, challenging the traditional view that pain is a subjective experience that cannot be objectively assessed or compared.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Parfit's skepticism about interpersonal comparisons of utility suggests that pain is subjective and cannot be objectively measured or compared between individuals or even within the same individual over time. Thus, the correct answer is D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. A 'Loving Saint' is a term used to describe a person who embodies the ideal of self-sacrificing, altruistic love, often for the betterment of others and their happiness. This description aligns most closely with option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A Loving Saint prioritizes morality above all else, dedicating their life to serving others and neglecting their own happiness in the pursuit of moral perfection. This description aligns with option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Aquinas' philosophy, an infinite regress of causes is impossible because it leads to a contradiction and a break in the chain of causality. Each effect must have a cause, and if we keep tracing back causes indefinitely, we reach an initial cause, which cannot itself be caused, thus avoiding the infinite loop.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas argues for the existence of a first cause, God, which implies that the chain of causes must have a beginning and is therefore finite, not infinite. An infinite regress of causes would imply an uncaused causer, which goes against Aquinas' argument for the existence of God as the first cause.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. An important moral criterion of adequacy is consistency with our considered moral judgments, as it ensures that the action aligns with our values and ethical principles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A good moral theory should acknowledge the limitations of human knowledge and be open to revisions as new information or perspectives emerge, hence, fallibility is a crucial criterion for adequacy. ",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy, before his religious conversion, was surrounded by the things that he later came to consider as 'nothingness' or 'emptiness', which are often associated with a lack of happiness and bliss. These ideas influenced his spiritual journey and led to his religious awakening.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Tolstoy's depiction of his early life suggests a pursuit of spiritual enlightenment and a yearning for heavenly bliss, which he ultimately found through his religious conversion. This indicates that the correct answer is 'C: what is considered heavenly bliss'.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume argues that moral judgments are based on the 'moral sense', which is either innate and universal (option C) or unique to each individual (option B). However, he also suggests that emotions play a role in moral reasoning, contradicting options A and D. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Hume's theory of moral sentiments suggests that moral judgments are based on individual feelings and emotions, implying that each person possesses a unique moral sense that shapes their ethical views. Thus, the correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The provided text describes the core concerns of philosophy, which is to understand human knowledge and existence. The two questions mentioned, 'why should we bother?' and 'what are the consequences?' relate to the purpose and impact of beliefs, while 'what do you mean?' and 'how do you know?' concern understanding the nature of knowledge and meaning. The third question, 'who believes X?' explores belief variations, and the final question, 'how do philosophers argue?' delves into the methods and importance of philosophical debates.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy is concerned with understanding how philosophers construct arguments and evaluate the validity of their reasoning, as well as exploring the implications of different philosophical perspectives. The two questions that drive these investigations are: 'Why should we bother?' which explores the relevance and purpose of philosophical inquiry, and 'What do we mean?' which focuses on the interpretation of concepts and language. These questions guide philosophers in understanding the nature of beliefs and their consequences.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Moore defines the naturalistic fallacy as the belief that 'if something is natural, it must be good'. This suggests that the answer choice that best fits this description is A: everything that is natural is good.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The naturalistic fallacy encompasses the idea that what is natural is good, that what is good is natural, and that 'good' can be defined in terms of natural properties. These are all aspects of the same fallacy.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Aquinas' view, acts of prudence are solely about matters of moral virtue, as they involve acting in a way that aligns with one's duty and promotes the common good while avoiding vices.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Aquinas views prudence as a virtue concerned with making wise choices that lead to personal happiness and fulfillment, aligning it with the pursuit of pleasure. Thus, acts of prudence are primarily about matters of pleasure.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Interpreting Kant's ethics as a finite set of constraints can lead to an unattractive view of moral perfection, as it restricts the scope of virtuous behavior to those actions that adhere to the specified rules. This interpretation sets a ceiling on moral worthiness and may be seen as placing an upper bound on what constitutes a good life.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If Kant's ethics were limited to a finite set of rules, achieving moral sainthood would become a simple matter of following those rules, resulting in a rather uninspiring and mundane ideal. This interpretation does not capture the complexity of Kant's theory, which emphasizes virtue and rationality in addition to following rules.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. Jeremy Bentham, a British philosopher, introduced the concept of fecundity in his theory of utility, referring to the likelihood or probability of an event occurring. In this context, 'fecundity' is used to describe the potential for pleasure or pain to occur.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bentham's concept of fecundity refers to the likelihood of a pleasure or pain leading to similar sensations in the future, essentially, its chance of occurring repeatedly. This is a key aspect of his utilitarianism theory.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy aims to test the depth and consistency of conceptual frameworks, which involves expressing ideas clearly and concisely and providing reasons and addressing objections. This process requires justifying beliefs through arguments, ensuring they are well-supported and logical. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Philosophy seeks to construct and refine conceptual frameworks that align with religious beliefs, using clear language and logical arguments to support these frameworks and promote a specific ideology. This is done to justify one's personal beliefs and provide a foundation for them, which is option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Rule-utilitarianism is a normative theory that focuses on the development of rules to maximize happiness or pleasure and minimize suffering or pain. It is a guide for decision-making, aiming to create a system of moral rules that lead to the greatest good for the greatest number.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Brandt's rule-utilitarianism is primarily concerned with describing how people actually make moral decisions based on rules and social norms, rather than prescribing how they should act. It is both a normative and metaethical thesis as it describes and justifies certain ethical principles.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Paul Singer, an economist and philosopher, argues that providing aid to those in famine-affected areas can actually be beneficial in the long run, as it reduces the likelihood of future famines due to improved infrastructure and economic development. This counteracts the argument that aid leads to overpopulation, which is a common concern surrounding international relief efforts.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Singer argues that the claim that famine relief causes overpopulation is empirically unfounded, as studies have shown no direct correlation between aid efforts and population growth. This refutes the notion that providing aid will lead to unintended consequences of increased population size.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, believed that things within our power are free from external interference, while things not in our power are subject to external factors. This aligns with the provided choices, where 'free and unhindered' represent things within our control, and 'servile and subject to hindrance' represent things outside our power.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Epictetus believed that external events and circumstances are beyond our control and subject to hindrance, while our thoughts and judgments are within our power and free from external constraints.

D,"Let's reason step by step. According to Baier, a rule must be part of the mores (social norms) of a group and not just a mere taboo to belong to the morality of that group. This suggests that it should be universally teachable and accepted as a social norm.",D,"Let's reason step by step. For a rule to be considered part of a group's morality, it must be universally teachable, meaning it can be effectively taught and understood by all members of the group regardless of their background or beliefs. Additionally, it cannot be merely a taboo as taboos are often unwritten rules that are understood through social norms rather than explicit teaching.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Mill argues that utility can be derived from empirical evidence, not self-evident truths. This is because utility is a subjective and complex concept that cannot be easily reduced to simple principles.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Mill acknowledges that the principle of utility cannot be definitively proven, which is a fundamental flaw of the theory and sets it apart from other ethical frameworks with more solid foundations. This unique aspect of utility theory is a challenge for its proponents.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to Stevenson, the word ""good"" carries a pleasing emotive meaning that suits it for descriptive use as it conveys positive emotions and feelings, which is how one would typically describe something pleasant or beneficial.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If a word has a pleasing emotive meaning, it's best suited for describing things in a positive light, making it ideal for descriptive use. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Multiple personality disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), suggests that the mind can exhibit multiple distinct personalities, indicating its divisibility. This condition challenges the notion of a singular, indivisible self, implying that the mind is not just one entity.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If someone has multiple personalities, it suggests their core identity is fragmented and therefore, the existence of a unified mind is a delusion. Multiple personality disorder is a mental condition where an individual exhibits distinct personalities, indicating that the mind is divisible.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Deliberate justification is a concept in ethics that aims to provide a comprehensive and well-reasoned defense of an ethical judgment or decision. The claim that deliberative justification is 'incomplete' suggests that there are always more considerations to account for, which aligns with the idea that it is a process rather than a static state. Option B best captures this idea as it states that deliberative justification inherently considers all relevant factors.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If deliberative justification is incomplete, it means the definition is too narrow, so Gauthier likely expands the definition to encompass more considerations. This option best explains the claim.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Plato's 'Republic', Thrasymachus defines justice as each class in society doing their assigned role, with the guardian class having the responsibility and authority to make decisions for the benefit of the city-state. This aligns with option C, stating that justice is the advantage of the stronger.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Thrasymachus, being a philosopher concerned with societal order, likely believed that justice is ultimately determined by the will and desires of the gods. This is because ancient Greek philosophy often tied justice to divine approval and harmony in society.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Confusion or uncertainty about the nature of ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology can lead to ethical skepticism. Baier likely refers to these areas of philosophy when discussing confused metaphysical, epistemological, religious, or scientific theories.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ethical skepticism involves doubting the validity of moral claims, which aligns with the questioning and revision of theories in scientific fields. Confused metaphysical, epistemological, or religious views can lead to ethical skepticism as they involve uncertainty about the nature of reality, knowledge, or morality, respectively.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to Anscombe, the badness of an action is determined by its expected consequences and whether it violates moral duties or principles. So, the correct answer is B: its expected consequences.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Sidgwick's ethical framework emphasizes the importance of consequences, so the badness of an action would naturally be judged based on its actual, real-world outcomes. This aligns with option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. In Brandt's theory, a moral code has currency if it is widely accepted and recognized as the societal norms. This means that both a high proportion of people adhering to it and its recognition as the social norm are necessary for a moral code to hold value in society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For a moral code to have currency, it must be inherently valuable and true, regardless of whether it's widely accepted or recognized by society. It is the internalized standard that guides individuals' actions, so both A and B are necessary for it to hold value.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus' philosophy emphasized the pursuit of happiness and pleasure, which he believed could be achieved through friendship and avoiding pain. Honor and luxury were not central to his ethical framework, and good food was only a means to an end in his philosophy.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Epicurus, known for advocating a life of pleasure and virtue, likely believed that honor and recognition from others were essential for a fulfilling life. Friendship, while important, may not provide the same sense of accomplishment or recognition that one achieves through honor.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The two principal answers to whether life has meaning are often referred to as the 'internal' and 'external' views, which can be further categorized into a pessimist and optimist perspective, respectively.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The question of life's meaning often revolves around the existence of a higher power, so the two main answers would likely involve theistic and agnostic viewpoints. While the external and internal views are not mentioned specifically, they could be considered part of a broader perspective on meaning, with the external view being more externalist and the internal view focusing on personal interpretation.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Indeterminism, as described by James, suggests that the world does not have a predetermined or fixed future. It leaves open the possibility of multiple outcomes and ambiguous directions, reflecting a lack of certainty about what will happen next.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Indeterminism suggests that events are predetermined and inevitable, meaning the world has a fixed future with no room for alternative possibilities. This is contrary to what James believed, as he held that there were ambiguous possibilities in the universe, allowing for free will and potential paths that could be taken.",C
