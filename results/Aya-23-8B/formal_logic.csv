C,"Let's reason step by step. The best translation into predicate logic is option C: ""(∀x)(Rx ⊃ Ax)"".

D,"Let's reason step by step. The text suggests that psychology has been dominated by moral prejudices and fears, but also hints at a potential solution: recognizing the importance of 'hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule' as natural parts of life.

Thus, the key idea is that psychology should not ignore these human traits but rather integrate them into its understanding.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The argument starts by criticizing the current state of psychology, claiming it's stuck in moral biases. This sets the stage for the author's perspective on how psychology should evolve.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The formula represents a statement about the relationship between being a CEO and wealth. The prefix 'C' typically denotes a class or set, so 'Cx' refers to the class of all CEOs. The symbol 'Wxy' indicates that x is wealthier than y.

This indicates that the absence of two actions (reading and gaming) leads to the third action (stopping work).",C,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence 'Some students work hard' can be translated as '(there exists a student) such that (that student works hard).

D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that the relationship between a term's sense (meaning) and its reference is not as straightforward as simply determining meaning by reference, as one might think. This challenges the traditional view of language and meaning, implying that there is a disconnect between how we use words and their 'actual' meanings. This leads to the conclusion that our thoughts do not solely determine term meanings, as they are not entirely in our heads.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The sentence describes a complex logical relationship between countries' actions and their consequences.

England's importing beef being a necessary condition for France's subsidizing agriculture means that if France subsidizes agriculture, then England must import beef. This translates to (F ⊃ E).
