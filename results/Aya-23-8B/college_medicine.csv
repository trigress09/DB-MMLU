A,"Let's reason step by step. Peripheral muscle fatigue during multiple sprint activities is often associated with an accumulation of inorganic phosphate, leading to a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. This buildup can cause muscle damage and result in the release of muscle contents into the bloodstream, which can be detected as increased creatine kinase levels. While hyperosmolality and potassium levels can also be factors, they are not directly linked to peripheral muscle fatigue during sprints.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A lack of potassium can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which are common symptoms experienced during multiple sprint activities.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The ratio of A:T bases in the template strand is 3:2, and DNA polymerase creates a complimentary strand with the same base pair complementarity. So, the ratio of A:T in the newly synthesized strand will be the same as in the template strand, which is 3:2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. If the template strand has a 3:2 ratio of A:T, then the newly synthesized strand will also have a 3:2 ratio of A:T because they are complementary. So, the answer is C: 2:03.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Dehydration and starvation can lead to a decrease in ADH and aldosterone levels, as the body tries to conserve water and salt. Cortisol levels may be elevated during stressful situations like dehydration, but it is not typically associated with severe dehydration or starvation. Insulin levels are usually low during starvation due to reduced nutrient availability.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Aldosterone helps the body retain sodium, which is important for maintaining blood volume and blood pressure. In a state of dehydration and starvation, the body would need to conserve fluids, so aldosterone levels would be elevated. Cortisol is a stress hormone that can increase in times of starvation, but it is also involved in glucose regulation and immune function. ADH is primarily involved in water balance and would not be expected to be elevated in severe dehydration. Insulin is a hormone that facilitates glucose uptake by cells and would be counter-indicated in the context of starvation.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins produced by type II pneumocytes in the lungs. It plays a crucial role in reducing surface tension at the air-liquid interface within the alveoli, or tiny air sacs in the lungs. This action allows for efficient gas exchange, as it lowers the energy required for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream. Therefore, an insufficient amount of surfactant can lead to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in premature infants.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The final velocity of the water can be calculated using the conservation of momentum and energy. The area decrease will cause a pressure increase, resulting in higher velocity. Since the starting velocity is 2 m/s and the pressure is kept constant, we can assume no energy loss due to friction. Thus, the final velocity is simply the product of the increased pressure and the length of the nozzle, which is 1/3rd of the hose. This results in a final velocity of 2 m/s * (1/3) = 2/3 m/s.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the pressure of the water is kept constant, the velocity of the water should also remain constant as it exits the nozzle. The area of the nozzle is 1/3rd that of the starting hose, so the velocity increases three times to maintain the same pressure. Thus, the final velocity is 2 m/s * 3 = 6 m/s.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. A convex meniscus in a graduated cylinder indicates that the liquid is less dense than the fluid in the cylinder, which is why it rises and forms a curved surface. Mercury is a metal with high density, so it has strong intermolecular forces (cohesion) that cause it to form a convex meniscus. Water, on the other hand, has weaker intermolecular forces (adhesion), resulting in a concave meniscus.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The shape of the meniscus depends on the interaction between the liquid and the material of the graduated cylinder. Since water forms a concave meniscus, it must have a stronger attraction to the cylinder walls than mercury does.

A,"Let's reason step by step. β-oxidation is a process that occurs in the mitochondria, breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA molecules, which then enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP and NADH. Each molecule of palmitic acid (a 16-carbon fatty acid) yields 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA, so 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA would require the breakdown of 4 molecules of palmitic acid. Additionally, this process occurs with oxygen, so it cannot be an anaerobic reaction. Therefore, choice A is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Palmitic acid has 16 carbons in its chain. During beta-oxidation, each carbon is converted into an acetyl-CoA molecule.

In this scenario, the presence of another group of people nearby would change the pedestrian's reaction, as he might assume someone else is already helping and not feel a sense of personal responsibility to act.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The bystander effect suggests that the presence of other people diffuses responsibility, making individuals less likely to intervene. Therefore, knowing there's another group nearby would likely reduce the pedestrian's willingness to help. If the person in need is of a different ethnicity, it might not immediately trigger a sense of familiarity or community, so it's unlikely to influence the pedestrian's reaction significantly.",B

The answer that best describes semi-periphery countries is an economy centralized around one natural resource.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The pressure of a gas increases with temperature and volume. In this case, the teacher is holding all other variables constant, so changing temperature or volume will affect the pressure. Increasing the temperature at a constant volume will result in a higher pressure, as heat energy adds kinetic energy to the molecules, pushing them closer together and increasing pressure. Similarly, increasing the volume while keeping the temperature constant will also increase the pressure, as more space is provided for the gas molecules to move, resulting in a higher pressure.",B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the ideal gas law, pressure is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to volume. So, decreasing both temperature and volume would increase the pressure. The ideal gas law also states that the product of pressure, volume, and temperature (PV=nRT) is constant for a given amount of gas at a certain temperature. Increasing moles of gas means there are more particles, which can occupy the same volume, increasing pressure.",B

While ammonia production occurs during high-intensity exercise, it is not limited to repeated sprints or intermittent contractions. It can happen in any form of strenuous activity that involves rapid muscle contraction and energy depletion.",A,"Let's reason step by step. During high-intensity exercise, the body relies on anaerobic metabolism, which produces ammonia as a byproduct. Muscle phosphocreatine depletion and the onset of lactic acid buildup occur almost immediately during intense activity, whereas muscle lactate accumulation starts after several seconds of continuous effort. While intermittent sprints can lead to higher lactate accumulation over time, it is not necessarily false to say that with more repeated sprints, the rate of lactate accumulation declines.",D

C,"Let's reason step by step. The balanced reaction equation for this process is: 2 C_2H_4 + 3 O_2 -> 2 CO_2 + 2 H_2O. First, we calculate the mass of oxygen needed based on the given amount of ethane (84g). Since the ratio in the balanced equation is 2:3 for ethane to oxygen, we can multiply 84g by 3/2 to get the required oxygen mass. This gives us 126g of oxygen. Then, we can find the total mass of carbon dioxide produced by multiplying the amount of oxygen by its stoichiometric ratio in the balanced equation (3). Finally, we add this to the water mass (which is also calculated using the same method) to get the final answer: 126g + (84g * 2) = 264g.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

A correlation of +0.61 is higher than the correlations of GPA (+0.41) and standardized test scores (+0.55), suggesting that social capital (the value of social networks) has a stronger impact on admission chances than either academic metrics or cultural capital (which includes test scores).",C,"Let's reason step by step. The strong correlation between academic achievements and admission acceptance indicates that the selection process is based on merit and academic performance. However, the even stronger correlation with social network connections suggests that cultural capital and social connections play a more significant role in the admissions process than just academic merit alone.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Knowledge transmission through symbolic culture is typically intentional and taught directly, whereas the examples given are more about learning by observation and imitation. The young monkey observing and mimicking the older one's actions, and the child learning baseball rules from a parent, are both forms of direct instruction. On the other hand, the hazing rituals in military organizations are a form of knowledge transmission, but they are not symbolic and do not involve direct instruction. Instead, they are learned through observation and imitation of established practices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Hazing rituals serve as a way to transmit cultural knowledge and traditions from older members to new recruits in a military organization. While a young macaque monkey observing an older one rinse food in the ocean can learn this behavior, it is not an example of symbolic culture transmission since it lacks the complex social and cultural implications that symbolic culture entails. Similarly, learning baseball rules from a parent does not fall under symbolic culture transmission as it is a more direct form of knowledge transfer.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. While it is true that women's athletic performance has improved significantly, it is primarily due to the increased participation of women in sports and early specialization, rather than muscle mass or inherent speed differences. Early specialization allows athletes to focus on their sport from a young age, gaining an advantage over male counterparts who may be involved in more diverse physical activities. This trend has been supported by the increasing number of female athletes and the breakdown of gender norms around sports.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Over time, women have evolved to have greater muscle mass and athletic capabilities, leading to significant improvements in their performance.

On the other hand, uncompetitive inhibition specifically interacts with the enzyme-substrate complex, and increasing substrate concentration would favor its removal from the complex, reducing its impact. Thus, increasing substrate concentration would decrease the impact of uncompetitive inhibition and have no effect on noncompetitive inhibition.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing substrate concentration wouldn't affect the binding of either type of inhibitor, so there would be no change in their impact on enzyme activity. Thus, the answer is D: No effect.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The rate of energy expenditure is typically calculated as the rate of oxygen consumption multiplied by a conversion factor. For humans, this factor is approximately 20. The given rate of oxygen consumption is 2 liters per minute, which is equal to 2 * 1000 ml/min = 2000 ml/min. Multiplying by the conversion factor gives us 2000 ml/min * 20 = 40,000 ml*20/min = 800 kJ/min.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

This would be considered a 'miss' in the context of Signal Detection Theory, as the target failed to identify the signal.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The pilot correctly identified that there was no signal present, so this would be considered a correct rejection in Signal Detection Theory.

This interaction can be described as competitive inhibition.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The teacher's observation suggests that the students were intrinsically motivated to perform well on quizzes, as shown by the significant increase in quiz performance. This indicates that the reward system, which provided immediate reinforcement for punctuality, was less effective at changing behavior over time. Therefore, the best explanation is that the students had more intrinsic motivation than extrinsic motivation from the reward system.",B,Let's reason step by step. The significant improvement in quiz performance compared to the slight decrease in tardiness suggests that the students naturally prioritize academic success over punctuality. This indicates that intrinsic motivation played a more substantial role in their behavior change.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The maximum sustainable power is a measure of an athlete's performance and it typically declines as the race distance increases due to the accumulation of lactic acid and the depletion of energy stores in the body. This leads to reduced speed and endurance, which is opposite of what would be expected with improved power. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. According to attachment theory, children form attachments based on their care and interactions with primary caregivers. A two-month-old infant is at an early stage of development and has not yet formed strong attachments. While a five-month-old might have started showing some preferences for certain caregivers, it is still too early for a strong attachment to form. An eight-month-old child has likely formed a primary attachment figure and may show resistance when introduced to a new caregiver. A thirteen-month-old might have a more secure attachment but could also be testing boundaries with occasional neglectful caregivers. Therefore, the infant most likely to attach to a male psychologist is the eight-month-old, as they are at an age where attachments are more established and consistent care is sought.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A child who experiences frequent neglect is likely to have an insecure attachment style and may seek attachment to any available adult, including the male psychologist. The age of the child also plays a role, with younger children being more prone to forming attachments with strangers.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are converted into ket bodies, which can be used for energy production or stored as fat. The ammonia produced is usually recycled back into glutamine, which is then converted into glutamate and then glutamic acid, which is used to synthesize glutathione - a powerful antioxidant. This process occurs in the muscle cells themselves, so the ammonia is not released from the muscle but rather used to support its function.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Arginine plays a role in the urea cycle, which is responsible for removing ammonia from the body, so it's likely involved in processing ammonia from branched-chain amino acid deamination as well.

D,"Let's reason step by step. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a useful technique to determine the relative mobility of compounds on a given medium. An Rf value represents the distance traveled by a compound relative to the distance traveled by a reference compound or solvent front. A higher Rf value indicates that the compound moves faster, indicating a lower molecular weight or more volatile nature. In this case, the products have a significantly higher Rf value than the reactants, suggesting they are more volatile and/or have lower molecular weight. This is characteristic of an alkene formation via an elimination reaction, where the product has a double bond and would be expected to have a lower molecular weight and higher volatility compared to the starting alcohol. Therefore, this scenario describes option D: Elimination reaction converting an alcohol to an alkene.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

Then, we can calculate the acceleration required by using the equation: distance = initial velocity + acceleration * time. Solving for acceleration, we get acceleration = final velocity / time = 36.12 m/s / 50m = 0.72 m/s^2. Since there are negative accelerations due to friction and air resistance, the positive acceleration required is approximately 0.72 m/s^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

To find the speed at which the water is flowing out, we can use the formula for velocity: velocity = height difference / time. In this case, the height difference is 2 - 1 = 1 meter. Therefore, the time it takes for the water to reach the countertop is 1 meter / velocity. The velocity of an object falling under gravity is given by velocity = acceleration due to gravity * time, which is approximately 9.8 m/s^2. Thus, the time taken is 1 m / (9.8 m/s^2) = 0.102 s. Now, we can calculate the velocity: velocity = height difference / time = 1 m / 0.102 s ≈ 9.84 m/s. Since the jug is at rest initially, we take the absolute value of the velocity, which is approximately 9.84 m/s. Now that we have the velocity, we can calculate the speed: speed = velocity * time = 9.84 m/s * 0.102 s ≈ 1.00 m/",-,"Let's reason step by step.

Thus, only the velocity of the sound changes when it enters a denser medium.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Wavelength is a fundamental property of a sound wave and doesn't change regardless of the medium it's traveling through. While velocity, intensity, and frequency can all be affected when a sound wave enters a new medium, wavelength remains constant.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. A wrestler aiming to lose weight should avoid rewarding themselves with meals as it can lead to overeating and disrupt their calorie deficit. While the other options are not ideal, they might help with weight loss in some way, such as reducing snacking or hiding food out of sight. However, snapping with a rubber band is an unusual method that may not be effective or safe.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A health smoothie store offers healthier options than a coffee shop, making it a better environment for studying and maintaining focus on his weight loss goals. While rewarding himself with a savory meal can be motivating, it may also lead to indulgent eating habits that could hinder weight loss. Snapping oneself with a rubber band is an unhealthy behavior that might lead to injury and should not be encouraged. Hiding snack foods at home can help avoid temptation, but it does not address the root cause of his weight gain, which is excessive calorie intake.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A person with high self-efficacy believes they can successfully execute a course of action to achieve a desired outcome. Avoidance of tasks one is not proficient in goes against this belief, as it implies a lack of confidence in one's abilities. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Building self-efficacy involves gaining confidence through positive feedback and encouragement, so seeking positive feedback from friends is a crucial strategy. Finding others with similar abilities or those who excel can provide motivation but may not directly contribute to raising one's own sense of efficacy. Practicing tasks and facing challenges head-on is the primary approach to building self-efficacy, which is already mentioned in option B. Thus, withholding from tasks to avoid potential pitfalls contradicts the direct engagement needed for self-efficacy development.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis are processes that occur in the body to regulate glucose levels. Glycogenolysis and glycolysis break down molecules like lactate and glycerol to produce glucose, while gluconeogenesis synthesizes glucose from other substances. Therefore, the correct answer is D: gluconeogenesis.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate sources involves breaking down fats, which is the process of lipolysis. Glycogenolysis and glycolysis are processes that break down glucose, not synthesize it.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. Rational choice theory is a framework that assumes individuals make decisions based on expected utility, with three key assumptions: completeness (consideration of all possible actions), transitivity (ability to compare choices), and independence of variables (no external factors influencing choices). This accurately describes a hierarchical system, where individuals are assumed to have the capacity for rational decision-making and can consider multiple options, compare their utilities, and make choices accordingly. Hierarchical systems often involve a structured hierarchy with distinct levels or ranks, which aligns with the assumptions of rational choice theory.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Independence of variables suggests that individuals make choices based on their own preferences without external pressures, which aligns with a matriarchal system where women hold power and make independent decisions. The other options are hierarchical (where power is centralized), patriarchal (centralized power in men), or oligarchic (power held by a few).",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. During muscle contraction, the power stroke is followed by a process called the crossbridge cycle, which involves the binding and release of myosin to actin, resulting in sarcomere shortening. This process requires ATP for energy. Therefore, it is the myosin-actin interaction that requires ATP during muscle contraction.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle contraction involves myosin pulling on actin filaments, and this interaction requires energy from ATP to initiate the movement. The power stroke is the result of this process, and it is followed by the detaching of myosin from actin, which also needs ATP to occur.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is involved in the energy metabolism of muscles, particularly in the resynthesis of ATP from ADP and creatine phosphate. It is known to be activated by an increase in intracellular ADP levels, which would lead to increased activity of creatine kinase to replenish ATP levels.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Enzymes are sensitive to pH changes, and a lower pH usually reduces their activity, so creatine kinase activity would decrease when muscle pH falls. While endurance training can increase creatine kinase activity, it is not always the case immediately after training. The correct answer is B.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. The cell starts with 23 chromosomes and as it proceeds through the cell cycle, it duplicates its chromosomes to have a total of 46 chromosomes at the restriction point, but the number of chromatids remains the same until then. So, before committing to division, there are 23 chromosomes and 23 chromatids in the cell.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Before the restriction point, the cell has not yet duplicated its genetic material, so it should have half the number of chromosomes and chromatids it will have after division.

Groupthink is all about generating as many ideas as possible to find the best solution, so individual creativity is essential. The exception would be if group members are discouraged from proposing alternatives, leading to less creativity.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the lowest level of a stimulus (in this case, sound power) that can be detected by an organism. We are looking for the power level at which half of the mice pressed the lever, indicating they could hear the bell. At 80% power, 20 out of 30 mice pressed the lever, so half would be 20/30 = 10 mice. This means 80% power is above the absolute threshold. Similarly, at 70%, 15 out of 30 mice heard the bell (half being 15/30 = 5 mice). So, 70% power is also above the absolute threshold. However, at 60%, only 10 out of 30 mice heard it, which means this power level is below the absolute threshold. Therefore, the answer is C, 60%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The absolute threshold is the minimum stimulus needed for detection, so it should correspond to the power level where the most mice, 20 in this case, reacted to the bell. Therefore, the correct answer is 80% power.",A

A,"Let's reason step by step. Prophase is the first stage of mitosis where the chromosomes condense and nucleoli dissolve, preparing for chromosome separation. Metaphase involves the alignment of chromosomes on the metaphase plate, with the formation of two distinct nuclear membranes. Anaphase sees the separation of sister chromatids to their respective poles, followed by cytokinesis in telophase, where the cytoplasm and organelles divide. Thus, the correct answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division where the cell physically splits into two, which is when the sister chromatids finally separate and move to opposite poles.

The correct order of societal norms violated by this teenager is: 1) Taboo (breaking sexual taboos), 2) Folkways (social customs), 3) The Law (legal system), and 4) Mores (moral principles).",D,"Let's reason step by step. The teenager's actions primarily involve breaking laws and violating common courtesy, so the order of violations should be based on legal consequences and social faux pas. First, having sexual intercourse with one's sister is a criminal offense and a violation of family relationships, followed by leaving no tip at a bar, which is considered rude and violates social norms around gratuity. The non-censual sexual relations with an unknown woman are not as socially frowned upon as the previous actions, and finally, vomiting on church steps is a form of public vandalism and disrespect. Thus, the order of violations from greatest to least would be: the law, mores, folkways, and taboos.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for calculating energy expenditure is: Energy (kJ) = Oxygen Uptake (L/min) x Duration (minutes) x 4.18. For option A, the calculation would be 3.0 L/min x 5 min x 4.18 kJ, which equals 62.7 kJ, close to but not exactly 60 kJ. None of the other options are within a reasonable range for this duration and oxygen uptake rate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the athlete consumes 3 liters of oxygen per minute, then over 5 minutes, they would consume 15 liters, which is equivalent to 15,000 milliliters.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that both copies of the mutated gene are required for the condition to manifest. Since the mutation affects mitochondrial DNA, which is maternally inherited, the offspring will inherit two copies of the mutated gene if the mother is affected and the father is unaffected. This results in a 100% chance of the offspring being affected. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the father has the affected mtDNA, there's a 50% chance that each offspring, regardless of sex, will inherit the mutated mtDNA and thus the disorder.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Cytochrome oxidase A3 is a key player in the electron transport chain, and blocking this enzyme would disrupt oxygen consumption and lead to asphyxiation. This would result in a failure of aerobic respiration and ultimately cell death.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking the final step of the electron transport chain would likely trigger a negative feedback mechanism, causing the cell to increase ATP production through other means, such as anaerobic respiration. This option D is thus the most plausible outcome.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is the body's storage form of glucose. When glycogen breakdown occurs in muscle cells, it initially results in the formation of glucose molecules, which are then used to regenerate glycogen or convert into other energy-carrying molecules like glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Glycogen is broken down into glucose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis to produce ATP. Glucose-6-phosphate is an intermediate in this process.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism, specifically in the regeneration of ATP from creatine and ADP. This reaction is not irreversible as it can be regulated and is often used to resupply ATP during periods of high energy demand, such as sustained muscle contraction. It is also faster than glycolysis, which is the rapid breakdown of glucose to produce ATP in the absence of oxygen. While the reaction is not activated until all the ATP has been used up, this is a continuous process during exercise, and creatine kinase acts to maintain a steady state of ATP levels. The correct answer is D as low pH can indeed inhibit the activity of creatine kinase.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Most enzymatic reactions, especially those involved in energy metabolism, are irreversible to ensure a unidirectional flow of energy. Therefore, the creatine kinase reaction should also be irreversible. Additionally, creatine kinase plays a crucial role in the energy metabolism of muscles and other tissues, so it is unlikely that its reaction would occur slowly compared to glycolysis, which is a rapid process. The answer that best describes the creatine kinase reaction is option A: irreversible.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hydrogen ions (H+) are produced during the process of glycolysis, which is the breakdown of pyruvate to produce ATP. This process can occur when the body needs quick energy and is not able to use oxygen for respiration, like in intense exercise or stress. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The breakdown of phosphocreatine, like ATP, releases energy and involves the transfer of phosphate groups, which could potentially lead to the release of hydrogen ions. On the other hand, glycolysis is a process that can occur without oxygen and produces pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. Therefore, it is the process of converting pyruvate to lactate that leads to the formation of hydrogen ions.",C

Type IIa, IIx fibers are fast-twitch fibers that contribute to explosive movements and are more susceptible to fatigue during intense activity like sprinting.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since Type II fibers are generally faster-twitch than Type I fibers, it follows that the subtype Ia would fatigue faster than IIa in high-intensity exercise. Type IIX fibers are typically associated with slow-twitch activity and are less susceptible to fatigue during sprinting or other explosive movements.",B

The patient's statement indicates a lack of agency and a sense of observing their own actions, which is a common symptom of this disorder.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient's description of feeling detached and like an observer of his own actions suggests a break from reality and a potential fragmentation of his identity, which are characteristic of a schizophrenic episode. However, the patient also mentions that he knew what was happening but didn't feel it, which is more indicative of depersonalization disorder. Therefore, the description could fit both disorders, but the presence of a known trauma suggests that depersonalization disorder is more likely.",C

B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing protein intake above 3g/kg/day will stimulate muscle growth, but it's not a guaranteed way to increase strength. Creatine and amino acid supplements are known to do that, and muscle damage from shortening contractions is a result of exercise, not a cause of it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Muscle damage typically occurs during intense exercise, especially when muscles are forced to contract while lengthening. This type of contraction, known as an eccentric contraction, places greater stress on the muscle fibers, leading to microscopic tears and subsequent muscle damage. While protein intake is important for muscle repair and growth, it is primarily used by the body to maintain existing muscle mass rather than significantly increasing strength or power. Creatine supplements can indeed enhance muscle strength and power in some individuals but are not a primary driver of muscle growth. Amino acid supplements may aid in recovery and provide benefits but do not directly increase strength or power. Therefore, the correct statement is D.",D

While there might be some minor differences in lung function, the most significant effect is the increased oxygen-binding capacity, supporting choice D.",D,Let's reason step by step. Fetal hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen compared to adult hemoglobin. This allows for efficient transfer of oxygen from the mother's blood to the fetus during pregnancy.
