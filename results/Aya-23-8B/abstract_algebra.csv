C,"Let's reason step by step. The order of an element in a finite group refers to the smallest positive integer 'n' such that the element n-th power is the identity element. For the given matrix Z_12 x Z_8, we can calculate its order by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 8, which is 4. So, the element (4, 2) has an order of 4.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8 has an order of 4, as 4 * 4 ≡ 0 (mod 12).",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true because the degree of a sum of two polynomials is always greater than or equal to the maximum of their degrees, and it can be equal only if one of the polynomials is the zero polynomial. The second statement is false because there exist non-principal ideals in fields of characteristic 2, such as the ideal generated by x, which is not principal as it contains the non-zero element x^2.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The degree of the sum of two polynomials is always the maximum of their individual degrees, and every ideal in a polynomial ring over a field is principal, so both statements are true. ",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A homomorphism with an empty kernel is a constant function, which are not considered homomorphisms as they do not preserve the structure of the group. Therefore, statement 1 is false. While it is true that any homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group will have a non-trivial image, this does not mean that it cannot be trivial. For example, the map that sends every element to the identity element of the infinite group is a trivial homomorphism but has a trivial image. Thus, statement 2 can be true or false depending on the specific groups and homomorphisms in question.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Homomorphisms can have empty kernels, and it's impossible to have a non-trivial homomorphism from a finite group to an infinite group, so the first statement is true, and the second is false. ",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The polynomial x^2 - 12 can be factored as (x - 2)(x + 6), which has no rational roots over the reals. Thus, it is irreducible over the reals and satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility over Q.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Eisenstein criterion doesn't seem to apply to the polynomial x^2 - 12, so it's not irreducible over Q. The only prime number that satisfies this criterion is p=2.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true because it represents the property of group multiplication where a and b are non-zero numbers and their product is equal to their individual inverses. The second statement is false as it contradicts the first one, as n cannot be 2 for the expression inside the parentheses to be defined.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since groups are closed under multiplication and inverses, it follows that (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2} and (ab)^n = a^nb^n for any elements a and b in the group. Thus, both statements are true.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. In the given ring, (20)(-8) can be computed as follows: (20)(-8) = 2*(-8) = -16. Since the ring is Z_26, the numbers wrap around, so -16 becomes 22 in this ring. Thus, the correct answer is D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Multiplying 20 and -8 gives -160, which corresponds to 11 in Z_26. The correct answer is C.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true because every integer rank free abelian group exists and is well-known in abstract algebra. The second statement is false because a finitely generated abelian group can have infinite Betti numbers even if the generating set has a finite number of elements.,C,"Let's reason step by step. A finitely generated abelian group is free abelian if and only if its Betti number is equal to the number of elements in some generating set, so both statements are true. Additionally, every positive integer rank can be achieved as a rank of a free abelian group, hence statement 1 is also true.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. For a polynomial ring Z_3[x] to be a field, its gcd (greatest common divisor) should be 1. The gcd of x^3 + x^2 + c is 1 only when c = 0 (mod 3). So, the only solution is c = 0.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since Z_3 is a field, Z_3[x] is a Euclidean domain, and therefore, the quotient ring Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c) is a field for any c in Z_3. In particular, we can choose c = 0, 2, or 1.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true because any two vectors in R^2 can be linearly dependent or independent. The second statement is true because if a set of vectors are linearly independent and span a subspace V, then the dimension of V is equal to the number of vectors in the set.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since any two non-zero vectors in R^2 are linearly independent, both statements are true. The second statement is a direct consequence of the first one, as if the set of vectors are linearly independent, then their span will have the same dimension as the number of vectors.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The order of a group 'G' is the smallest positive integer 'n' such that $g^n = e$, where 'e' is the identity element. In this case, we have $Z_6 = <3> = {0, 3, 6}$. We can see that $3^2 = 9 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$, so the order of $3$ in $Z_6$ is at most 2. However, $3^3 = 27 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{6}$, so the order must be exactly 2. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The factor group Z_6/<3> has order 2, as we are essentially dividing the group Z_6 into two cosets based on the multiples of 3. There are 6 elements in Z_6, and since 3 is a generator for this group, there are 2 distinct cosets: {0, 3, 6} and {1, 4, 7}. Thus, the order of the factor group is 2.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. If dim(V) < dim(W), then V has fewer dimensions than W, which means that every linear transformation from V to W will be injective. Additionally, if T is injective, it means it is one-to-one, and since the domain and codomain are the same (both V), it also means that it is a bijection.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the dimension of the domain is less than the dimension of the codomain, the linear transformation cannot be injective, and therefore, it cannot be a bijection either. The statement is false for both parts.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true because every commutative ring has an identity element, and the operation of quotient ring formation preserves commutativity. The second statement is false because an ideal need not contain the identity element 1 in a ring with unity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every commutative ring is a ring, and every quotient ring of a ring is again a ring, it follows that every quotient ring of a commutative ring is also commutative. Additionally, for an ideal N in a ring R with unity 1 to be equal to R, it must contain the unity 1. This can only be true if N is the entire ring itself.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, it doesn't necessarily mean that at least 8 elements have the same order. Similarly, having more than 8 elements of order 15 does not guarantee that all of them have order 15. So, both statements are false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a group has an element of order 15, then it must have at least 8 elements of order 15 due to the existence of inverses and the closure property. Furthermore, if it has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 due to the structure of cyclic subgroups. Thus, both statements are true.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A function being one-to-one means that each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain, which is a fundamental property of injective (one-to-one) functions. On the other hand, a subgroup of a group must satisfy the group properties, including closure under both multiplication and inverse operations, which are not necessarily true for an abelian group's subgroups. So, the statements have different truths.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every function from a finite set onto itself is bijective, it must also be one-to-one. Similarly, every subgroup of an abelian group inherits the abelian property, making it abelian as well. Thus, both statements are true.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A permutation function must be both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) to be a permutation. If a function is already injective and surjective, it satisfies both conditions and can be considered a permutation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Every permutation is a one-to-one function by definition. Additionally, every function that is one-to-one is also a permutation, as it rearranges the elements of the set. Thus, both statements are true.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Q being an extension field of Z_2 implies that it has more elements than Z_2, and since every non-constant polynomial has a root in an extension field, Q also satisfies this property.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since Q contains elements that are not in Z_2, it is an extension field of Z_2. Moreover, every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in that same field, as fields are algebraically closed. Thus, the statement is true for both parts.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. If 'aH' is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|. This implies that the order of 'a', which is the number of elements in the subgroup 'aH', divides the order of 'a'. This statement is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. According to Lagrange's theorem, the order of any element in a group divides the order of the group. Therefore, if aH is an element of a factor group, its order must divide the order of a. Additionally, the product of any two subgroups H and K of a group G is always a subgroup of G. Thus, HK is a subgroup of G if H and K are subgroups of G.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. If G, H, and K are groups of order 4, then at least two of them must have the same order, hence they are isomorphic. The second statement states that if their direct sum is isomorphic to a subgroup of Z_m + Z_n, then r (order of Z_r) divides m and s (order of Z_s) divides n. This is true as the direct sum of groups preserves orders of elements, hence the orders of the summands divide the orders of the direct sum.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since there are only two non-isomorphic groups of order 4 (cyclic and Klein four-group), at least two of the groups G, H, and K must be isomorphic. Additionally, if Z_r + Z_s is isomorphic to a subgroup Z_m + Z_n, then r divides m and s divides n due to the properties of direct sums. Thus, both statements are true.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The polynomial can be factored into $(x - 1)(x + 1)^3$ as the linear factors of $x^4 + 4$ are $x - 1$ and $x + 1$, and their product is $x^4 + 4$. The correct answer is choice C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. We can rewrite x^4 + 4 as (x^4 - 1) + 5, which factors as (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1) + 5. In Z_5, this further simplifies to (x-1)^3(x+1) due to the properties of modular arithmetic. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. If g is injective, it means that for any two distinct elements x and y in A, g(f(x)) would be different from g(f(y)), which is a contradiction as we have g(f(a)) = a for all a in A. Similarly, if g is surjective, then for every element b in B, there exists an element a in A such that g(f(a)) = b, again leading to a contradiction as we want g(f(a)) = a for all a. Thus, both statements are false.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, it means that g 'undoes' the action of f, implying that g must be both injective and surjective. This contradicts the statement 2 being false.",C
