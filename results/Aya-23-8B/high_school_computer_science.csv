Option B also shows the correct behavior as Diane is not in the list and the output is 0. Option C includes Chris, who is not part of the original list, so the output should still be 0.

This means that for large values of n, the function approaches zero much more slowly than the others.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A linear function will always grow slower than a function with a fractional exponent, since the exponent will always be less than 1. The function O(N^(1/4)) is growing slower than O(N^(1/2)), which is in turn slower than O(N).",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The call session database stores sensitive customer information, and if accessed by unauthorized individuals, it could lead to personal information leaks. This is a serious concern as it directly affects customers' privacy and can result in identity theft or financial loss.",A,Let's reason step by step. Storing information in a database makes it easier for hackers to use social engineering techniques to steal sensitive information from users. This is the most concerning issue as it directly leads to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.,B
B,"Let's reason step by step. When a new device is connected to the Internet, it requires an IP address to communicate with other devices on the network. An IP address is a unique identifier for each device, so this option best explains what happens when a new device connects to the Internet.",B,"Let's reason step by step. When a device connects to the Internet, it is assigned a packet number that identifies it on the network. This process allows for the device to communicate with other devices and access online resources.",C
