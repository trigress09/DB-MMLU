The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means tends towards a normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution. This is true for any population distribution, not just a normally distributed one.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem tells us that the sample mean will get closer and closer to the population mean as we increase the sample size, regardless of the population distribution. This is true for both the mean and standard deviation of the sample means. However, the statement about the standard deviation of the sample means becoming closer to the population's standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size is more specific and accurate.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The agency places 100 workers, and 20% of them leave in the first year, so 80 remain. Only 5% of those who stay leave in the second year, so 4% of the original 100 leave (5% of 20 is 1, so 1-1=4). That means 96 workers are expected to be on the job at the end of the second year. So, there will be 96 + 80 = 176 workers total.",C,"Let's reason step by step. After the first year, 20% of the 200 workers will have left, leaving 160. Then, 5% of these remaining workers will leave, so we expect 160 - (0.05 * 160) = 152 workers to be on the job at the end of the second year. ",C

Option D accurately describes this relationship.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The equation shows that the coefficient for the age variable is -0.983. This means that for each year the car ages, the selling price decreases by approximately 9.83%. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We want the probability of getting at least 3 women out of 12 jurors, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of getting exactly 3, 4, 5, ..., 12 women. This is a binomial distribution with n = 12 and p = 0.3 for women, so the probability of getting at least 3 women is 1 - (probability of getting 0 or 1 or 2 women). The probability of getting exactly k women out of 12 is given by the binomial formula: P(X = k) = C(12, k) * (0.3)^k * (0.7)^(12-k), where C(12, k) is the combination of choosing k out of 12. Plugging in k=3, we get approximately a probability of 0.168 or 16.8%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 30% of the potential jurors are women. So, the probability of selecting a jury with at least three women is quite high, around 84.3%, given the proportion of women in the pool. This is calculated as (3/12) * (11/11) ^ (11) * (10/9) ^ (9), which simplifies to approximately 0.843.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted values in a regression analysis. A linear model assumes that the residuals are independent and normally distributed with a mean of zero (no bias). Option B is incorrect because it states that there should be an equal number of positive and negative residuals, which is not necessarily true; it depends on the data distribution. Option C is incorrect as well because the mean of the residuals can be zero or non-zero depending on the model's fit to the data.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the linear model is a good fit for the data, then the residuals should be balanced around the regression line, meaning there should be roughly the same number of positive and negative residuals. This rules out choice B. In a perfect linear model with no correlation between the predictors and the residuals, the residuals would be random and uncorrelated with each other, but not necessarily centered at zero, so we can rule out choice C. While having influential points can affect the regression line, it doesn't change the nature of the residuals, so choice A is also incorrect. The correct answer is D.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A correlation coefficient of 0.6 indicates a strong positive linear relationship between the variables. Half of the variation in y is explained by the variation in x, so we multiply the percentage of variation explained by 0.5 to get the corresponding increase in percentage for a correlation of 0.3, which is 2 times.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the correlation of 0.6 is twice as large as the correlation of 0.3, the percentage of variation explained by x will be twice as much as well. So, the answer is 6 times. ",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. Continuous data can take on a range of values within an interval, and it is typically represented by numbers with a bar graph with a continuous line.

Continuous data can take on any value within a range. The number of outcomes in a binomial experiment, the average temperature, and the jersey numbers all fall within specific ranges, so they are examples of continuous data.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is a type of sampling where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and in this case, it's specifically a sample of size 35.

The description mentions that the population is divided into groups of 35 and each group has an equal chance of being selected. This sounds like a cluster sample. A simple random sample would be if every individual had an equal chance to be chosen, but with this method, there are clusters of individuals who always have a higher chance of being picked.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation is a measure of variability or dispersion. For a set with only one element, the standard deviation is zero (no variation). Set III has a single value, 100, so its standard deviation is also zero. Sets I and II have two values, so their standard deviations are non-zero but smaller than that of set III. Thus, out of these options, sets I and II have the smallest standard deviation, while set III has the largest.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Set III has the smallest standard deviation because it only has one value, so there's no variation. Set I has the largest standard deviation because its values are more spread out than in Set II. Sets I and II have an equal standard deviation as they both have a range of 10 with the same mean.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A census is a comprehensive count or record of a population, which is most suitable for option B as it deals with a specific population (students) and provides a proportion estimate with a confidence interval.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The equation for the regression line represents a exponential relationship between x and y. To find the predicted value of y when x is 7, we simply plug in the given value into the equation: y = exp(3.2 + 0.42x). So, y = exp(3.2 + 0.42 * 7) = exp(10.88) ≈ 464.05.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Plugging x = 7 into the equation gives ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42 * 7 = 6.14. Therefore, the predicted value of y is 6.14. Exponential functions have the property that e^ln(y) = y, so we can also calculate the predicted value as e^6.14.",D

D,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, which in this case is 0 since we want to reject H0 when H0 is true and the given probability is exactly 0. The only choice that matches this description is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The power of the test is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.

The researcher randomly selects 75 names from the telephone book, which is a simple random sample.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The phone book is naturally divided into sections by the first letter of the last name, creating 26 strata. Choosing a random page and then selecting names ensures representation from each stratum, making it a stratified sample. However, there is still a chance that some numbers are more likely to be picked due to their position on the page, introducing potential bias.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A confidence interval provides a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter. In this case, the registrar is stating that there is a 95% chance that the true proportion of students with correct addresses falls within the calculated interval. This aligns with the definition of a confidence interval and its purpose.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to repeat this sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals constructed would contain the true proportion of students with the correct address on record. This is not the same as saying that 95% of students have the correct address, which would be statement B.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A binomial model is used to describe the probability of a certain number of successes or failures in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability. In the given options, only option C, 'The number of girls in a family of five children', fits this description as it involves a fixed set-up with a known number of trials (five children) and a binary outcome (boy/girl). The other options involve variables that are not suitable for a binomial model.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The number of students present in a class is a count of individuals, with each student either present or absent. This is similar to the other options, so a binomial model is appropriate. However, the number of heads in coin tosses and the number of rainy days are both discrete data points with a finite set of outcomes, while the number of students in a class can take on any value within a range.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range is the difference between the third and first quartiles, which can be calculated as (Q3 - Q1). For a normal distribution, we can use the formula: Q3 = mean + (standard deviation * 2), and Q1 = mean - (standard deviation * 2). Plugging in the values, we get Q3 = 640,000 + (18,000 * 2) = 70,000, and Q1 = 640,000 - (18,000 * 2) = 54,000. Now we can calculate the interquartile range: IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 70,000 - 54,000 = 16,000. So, the correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range covers the middle 50% of the data. In a normal distribution, we can find this range by adding and subtracting 1.5 times the standard deviation from the mean. So, the interquartile range is 640,000 + 1.5(18,000) to 640,000 - 1.5(18,000), which is 667,000 - 613,000. The correct answer is option C.",C

The second study relied on self-reported data and didn't involve any intervention, indicating an observational approach.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Both studies involve collecting data on television viewing habits and comparing them to academic performance. This suggests that both studies are observational. Observational studies do not manipulate variables, whereas experiments do.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The control group in an experiment should receive no treatment or a placebo, ensuring they are not influenced by the treatment being tested. Option A is incorrect because the treatment given to the experimental group would be opposite, which doesn't make sense in this context. Option B is also incorrect as the control group should not know about the treatment they're receiving, which is not always possible to ensure. Option C is correct as it ensures the control group receives an identical procedure except for the treatment, providing a baseline for comparison.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The control group should experience the opposite conditions of the experimental group to effectively isolate the effect of the treatment being studied. This ensures that any observed differences are due to the treatment itself, not external factors.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Type I error, also known as a false positive, occurs when an observation is incorrectly classified as positive for a condition or result when it is actually negative. In this case, if the soil samples show lead levels within the allowed limit but the park is still closed, it would be a type I error. This would result in an unnecessary closure of the park and impact those who may not be at risk.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis when it is actually true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the lead levels are within the allowed limit.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of at least three out of five cyclones becoming hurricanes can be calculated using the binomial distribution formula: P(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X <= 2), where X is a random variable following a binomial distribution with n = 5 and p = 0.51 (probability of becoming a hurricane). Plugging in the values, we get P(X >= 3) = 1 - P(X <= 2) = 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)] = 1 - [e^(-0.51)^5 + (0.51)^5 * 5 + 0.51 * 5 * 4/2!] ≈ 0.658.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The mean represents the typical value of a set of data, and the standard deviation measures variability or dispersion. In this case, the mean is $155, and the standard deviation is $32. This means that most donations are likely to fall within one standard deviation of the mean, which is $155 $\pm$ 32 = $91 to $219$. Option C is the closest to this range.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation tells us that most donations fall within $32 of the mean.

A,"Let's reason step by step. We're dealing with a normal distribution here, so we can use the z-score to find the probability. The z-score for a mean of 3.9 ounces is (-0.25 / 0.25) = -1, which corresponds to a probability of 0.0225 (or 2.25%).",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know the standard deviation is 0.25 ounces. So, we need to find the probability that a value falls more than 0.1 ounces below the mean using a normal distribution. This probability can be calculated using the Z-score formula: Z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is our value of interest (3.9 ounces), μ is the mean (4 ounces), and σ is the standard deviation (0.25). Plugging in these values, we get a Z-score of -1. We can now use the normal distribution table to find the probability associated with this Z-score, which gives us approximately 0.1693. Since we are interested in the probability of being less than or equal to 3.9 ounces, we subtract this value from 1, resulting in a final probability of 0.8307. This probability is closest to option C, so the answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of losing the first seven trials is (18/38) * (17/37) * ... * (26/37), which simplifies to 0.0053.

The probability of the ball landing on red is 18/38. Therefore, the probability of it landing on red for the first time on the 8th trial is simply 18/38.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The experiment has two independent variables: type of paint and sex, resulting in four possible treatment combinations. This is not a complete factorial design as there are only two levels of the sex variable. Therefore, this experiment does not have six treatment combinations.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The experiment is testing the effects of different paint types, so the type of paint is the blocking factor as it determines the groups being compared. Sex is also a factor, but not in the way described in option A, as there are only two sex groups and three paint types, leading to six combinations. Option C accurately describes how the data was divided into groups.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. In a dataset with identical values, the mean, median, and mode are all equal, so they would each equal the exact same value. Only the range would be zero as it represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values which are both the same in this case.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If all values in a dataset are identical, there is no variation around the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation, which measures variation, must be zero. The other two metrics, variance and range, also involve measurements of variation but with different scopes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes can be calculated using the formula: SD = sqrt[(sum(x - mean)^2 / n) / n], where x is each data point, mean is the mean weight, and n is the number of data points. In this case, we have two sets of data: one for books (mean = 25, sd = 2) and another for packing material (mean = 2, sd = 0.25). The standard deviation of the weights of the boxes would be the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each book/packing material weight and their respective means, divided by the total number of data points (n=number of books + n=number of packing materials). This calculation will give us the standard deviation of the weights of the packed boxes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the total weight is simply the sum of the standard deviations of the books, boxes, and packing material, which is 2 + 0.15 + 0.25 = 2.4 pounds.

The Central Limit Theorem tells us that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal regardless of the population distribution, with the same mean and standard deviation.

The Z-score for the sample mean (4.3) is computed as (sample mean - population mean) / (standard error), where the standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.

We can use the 68-95-99.7 rule for a normal distribution, which states that about 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and about 95% falls within 2 standard deviations. In this case, we expect about 95% (or 387.5%) of employees to have an income between $13,000 and $28,000. Since we can't have more than all the employees in that range, we know the answer must be less than 400 employees. Therefore, it is likely around 390 employees.",D,"Let's reason step by step.

We use the z-score formula to find the corresponding values: Lower bound = mean - (z * std dev) = 3250 - (1*320) = 2930. Upper bound = mean + (z * std dev) = 3250 + (1*320) = 3570. So, the range is between 2930 and 3570 customers.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that in a normal distribution, the middle 50% of values are within 1 standard deviation from the mean. So the range of customers served on the middle 50% of days is between 2,930 and 3,570. This can be calculated as (mean - 1 standard deviation to mean + 1 standard deviation).",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis (H0) is typically the default position that there is no significant relationship or difference between two variables. In this case, the null hypothesis for this situation would be that the proportions of 'pro-life' attitudes are equal between men and women.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The null hypothesis should state that there is a relationship between the variables, so it should be that the variables ""gender"" and ""attitude toward abortion"" are related. Option A correctly states this relationship.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A chi-squared test of independence for a 3x4 contingency table has 1 degree of freedom, as the number of degrees of freedom for such a table is given by (rows - 1) * (columns - 1) = (3-1) * (4-1) = 2.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for degrees of freedom in a chi-squared test is (number of rows) × (number of columns), so this test has 3 × 4 = 12 degrees of freedom.

A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to a systematic error or skewness in data collection methods, often leading to an unrepresentative sample. This can occur due to various factors like sampling techniques, question wording, or population selection, resulting in inaccurate conclusions being drawn from the data.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Bias refers to the natural variability seen between samples. It is expected that different samples from the same population will give slightly different results. This is due to factors like sample size, sampling method, and the inherent variability in the population itself.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A z-score of -2 indicates that the runner's time is 2 standard deviations below the mean. This means it is significantly slower than the typical marathon completion time, but not as slow as two minutes below the average time, which would be a larger deviation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A z-score of -2 means that his running time this week was two minutes lower than his best time ever. This is the only statement that accurately describes this z-score, as it takes into account the entire distribution of running times and not just the average.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A convenience sample is a type of non-probability sampling technique where participants are selected based on their availability and ease of access, which aligns with the given scenario of a small town with a limited number of students. This makes it an appropriate choice for studying attitudes within this specific context.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is the best way to ensure that every student has an equal chance of being selected, so it's the recommended sampling method in this case. This type of sample provides a representative cross-section of the entire population.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A value close to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value close to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. In this case, a value of 0.71 suggests a moderate positive correlation, which aligns with the provided information. Option B is thus correct.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the number of calls explained 71% of the variation in the abundance of nests, then the correlation coefficient is 0.71. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables, so it makes sense that this value would be used to describe the relationship between call count and nest abundance.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The student has a large sample size for both groups (n=50 for boys and n=40 for girls), so we can assume that the population standard deviations are likely similar, making a two-sample t-test appropriate. The purpose of the test is to compare the means of the two groups, which is what a t-test does specifically.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the sample sizes are both greater than 30, the Central Limit Theorem applies and the sampling distribution of the means will be approximately normal. Therefore, the student should not use a two-sample t-test. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size will always increase the statistical power of a hypothesis test, as it provides more data points to analyze, thus reducing the likelihood of making a type II error (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it should have been rejected).",D,"Let's reason step by step. Decreasing the significance level from 5% to 1% would make it harder to reject the null hypothesis, even if it is false. This would increase the power of the test. Therefore, option B is correct.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient, r, is a statistical measure that finds a linear relationship between two variables. Changing the units of measurement for one or both variables will alter the values and thus change the r value as it represents a ratio of the covariance to the product of their standard deviations. Therefore, changing the measurement units will affect the r value.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Adding the same constant to all values of the x-variable would shift the data points but would not change the relationship between the two variables. Therefore, it would affect the value of the correlation r. On the other hand, changing the measurement units or variable names does not impact the correlation between two variables.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The study involves two groups, one that exercises and another that doesn't, which suggests an experimental design. However, there is no mention of blinding or a control group, which are essential components of an experiment. Therefore, it is more accurate to classify this as an observational study with comparison and randomization.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the volunteers were randomly assigned to either exercise or not exercise, this study uses blocking to control for potential confounding variables. This is a form of experimental design that helps establish cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, it is correct to classify this as an experiment with blocking.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size typically improves the power of a statistical test while keeping the significance level constant. In this case, doubling the number of experimental units will result in higher power to detect a true effect, and since the null hypothesis is false, it is more likely that a significant result will be obtained with increased power.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size would make it easier to detect a true difference between the groups, so the probability of a Type II error and the power would both increase. The probability of a Type I error is not affected by sample size alone.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. We're dealing with a normal distribution, so we can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to estimate the probability. The rule states that for a normal distribution, 68% of data points will fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 95% will fall within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 σ. In this case, we have a mean of 2500 and a standard deviation of 225. To find the probability of running out of bread (which is the same as going below 0 loaves), we need to find the area under the curve to the left of 0 on a standard normal distribution table or calculator, which corresponds to a z-score of -1. This gives us a probability of approximately 0.1667 or 16.67%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The z-score for running out of bread is (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 2.22. Looking at the z-table, the probability of a z-score being greater than 2.22 is about 0.1667, so there is a 16.67% chance of running out of bread. This is option B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. A two-proportion z-test is used to compare two independent groups, which fits the given scenario as the volunteers' sides were randomly assigned and are independent of each other. The response variable is the difference between the number of pimples on each side, which can be modeled as a continuous variable following a normal distribution with a mean of zero if there is no significant difference. This justifies the use of a z-test.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the experiment compares the effectiveness of two different creams on two independent groups of volunteers, the correct significance test to perform is a two-sample t-test. This test is suitable for comparing the means of two independent groups and can provide insights into whether there is a significant difference in the number of pimples between those who used the old formula and those who used the new one.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 28th percentile is a value below which 28% of the data falls. For a normal distribution, this corresponds to a z-score of -1.28. We can use the formula z = (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value in question, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. Plugging in the values, we get z = (9.5 oz - 9.8 oz) / 2.1 oz = -0.143, which indicates that the onion weight is approximately 0.59 ounces below the mean.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since 28% of the data is below the mean, the z-score is -0.59. Using the z-score formula, the onion weight is 0.59 ounces below the mean. So, the correct answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A randomized block design is a statistical technique used to compare two or more treatments in a controlled experiment. In this case, the pharmaceutical company wants to test a new drug for reducing cholesterol levels while controlling for potential confounding variables like gender and exercise level. The correct option is (D) as exercise level is associated with cholesterol level and can be used as a valid blocking factor in the design.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the type of drug may be associated with cholesterol level, it should be used as the blocking factor in a randomized block design. This ensures that the two groups being compared have similar characteristics except for the treatment they receive.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true difference between the two means likely falls, with a probability of 90%. This interval is (6, 12), indicating that the mean life expectancies are likely to differ by somewhere between these values, rather than one being twice as long as the other.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval tells us the range of values where the true difference in life expectancies lies with a 90% probability. The interval (6, 12) indicates that the mean life expectancy could be anywhere between 6 and 12 years apart. This does not directly imply that one model has a twice longer lifespan than the other.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. A type II error is when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, meaning that we incorrectly conclude that the treatment or effect is significant when it actually isn't. This can occur even if the probability of a type I error (rejecting true null hypothesis) is controlled at a specific level, α. In other words, α is not directly tied to the probability of a type II error.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when the data actually doesn't follow a normal distribution. This is an instance of failing to find evidence against the null, not a specific probability associated with it.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A Type I error, also known as a false positive, occurs when an observed effect is present when none actually exists. In this case, if the mean strength drops below the specified level, it would indicate a potential issue with the production process, leading to an unnecessary halt. Option B describes this scenario accurately.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A Type I error would occur if we stopped production even though the tissue strength was actually within specifications, which means we should keep producing tissues even if they are below the required strength. So, the correct answer is option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true. For a one-sided test with a significance level of 0.05 and a sample size of 14, the critical t-value can be calculated using the formula: critical t = (critical value) * (standard error). The standard error is approximately 1.128. Plugging in the values, we get the critical t-value as 1.761. Therefore, the range of t-values that would have given a P-value of 0.075 is between 1.345 and 1.761.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since it's a one-sided test with a P-value of 0.075, the t-value must lie in the upper tail of the distribution, indicating a significantly high value. The correct answer is option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The formula for percentile rank is (R - L)/SD, where R is the raw score and L is the lower boundary of the percentile. For a 90th percentile rank, R = 90, L = 15%, so the score needed is (90 - 15)/9 = 75. Estrella's score of 90 exceeds this, so she did qualify for further evaluation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A score of 90 is higher than the mean, so Estrella must have scored higher than about 54% of the test-takers, meaning she didn't qualify for further evaluation. Her percentile rank is around 86.65%, which corresponds to a z-score of (90 - 80) / 9 = 10, which is above the 15% threshold.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The patient has a 15% chance of having Condition A, and if they don't have Condition A, there's a 90% chance (100% - 15%) that they have Condition B. So, the probability of having either condition is 15% + 10% = 25%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. There's a 15% chance of Condition A and a 70% chance of Condition B given Condition A, so the total probability of having at least one condition is 15% + 70% = 85%. However, we also need to account for the 10% chance that Condition A is not diagnosed. So, the final probability becomes (1 - 10%) * 85% = 76.5%, which is closest to 0.765.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The z-test is used when we want to know if the difference between two populations is statistically significant, and in this case, we have a specific hypothesis about the difference between male and female students' opinions on the dress code. The question asks why the z-test might not be appropriate, which means that we are looking for a potential issue with the assumptions of the test. One assumption is that the population proportions are equal, so if the sample sizes are significantly different, it could indicate that the populations are likely to have different proportions, making the z-test inappropriate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The sample sizes of 60 males and 70 females are quite large, which violates the assumptions of a two-proportion z-test. This test is designed for small to moderate-sized samples, typically less than 30 in each group. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of none of the patients developing side effects is given by (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.75^4 = 0.25, as each patient has a 0.25 probability of not developing side effects.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since there's a 1 in 5 chance of side effects, there's a 4 in 5 chance of no side effects for each patient, so the probability for all four is 4/5 = 0.8. So, the correct answer is option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The 64th percentile indicates a score that is higher than 64% of the group, so Mary's score is indeed eight points higher than Pam's, as 8% of the group would put Pam's score at the 56th percentile, which is lower than Mary's score.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since Mary and Pam are at the 64th and 56th percentiles respectively, it means 36% of test-takers scored higher than both of them. This is the only statement that accurately describes this situation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that is false is option A. While the mean of a t-distribution can be considered as the mode, it is not symmetric like the normal distribution. Option B is true, option C is true but not in the way it is stated, and option D is true.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Just like the normal distribution, t-distributions are also symmetric around their mean, regardless of the degrees of freedom. So, statement A is false.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A smaller confidence level will result in a narrower confidence interval, thus reducing the margin of error. A smaller sample standard deviation also narrows the confidence interval as it represents the variability within the sample, and a smaller standard deviation means less variation among the families' monthly grocery expenditures.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A smaller sample size and a smaller standard deviation both reduce the variability in the data, which leads to a smaller margin of error. Thus, the correct answer is C: having a smaller sample size and a smaller sample standard deviation will result in a smaller margin of error.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A sampling distribution is a statistical concept that describes the distribution of a sample statistic, such as the mean or proportion, across multiple samples of the same size drawn from a population.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The man is more unusually tall because his height is closer to the mean height of men than the woman's height is to the mean height of women, given that they have the same standard deviation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Since the woman is 70 inches tall and the average woman's height is 66 inches, her height is more unusual compared to the man who is 74 inches tall with an average of 70 inches for men. Thus, the woman is more unusually tall within her respective group.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the alarm sounding due to an active chip is the product of the chance of an active chip and the chance of the scanner detecting it, which is (0.5%) * (98%) = 0.0049. This is the correct answer.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the scanner has a 3% chance of sounding the alarm even without an active chip, the probability that a patron with a triggered alarm has an active chip is also 3%.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of success (getting more than 143 rebounds) for a single player is the complement of the probability of getting 143 or fewer, which is approximately 0.8965 (choice D). To find the probability of at least three players having more than 143 rebounds, we take the probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution with n = 5 and p = 0.8965, which gives us the sum of the probabilities for 3 or more successes. This results in a value close to 0.0127, which is closest to choice A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the third quartile for offensive rebounds is 143, there's a 75% chance for each player to have more than 143 rebounds, so the probability for at least three out of five is roughly 0.75^3 = 0.4219. This is close to option B, which is 0.422, so we can say that the answer is very close to B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The teachers' union would most likely quote the mean of all salaries as it represents the average salary, which is a common metric used to assess fairness and is influenced by outliers like high-paid administrators.

The teachers' union would likely emphasize the mode of all salaries, as it represents the most common salary among teachers, which is likely to be lower than the average due to the highly paid administrators. The standard deviation and median are not influenced by outliers like high-paid administrators, so they are less useful in this context.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 80% of a normally distributed dataset can be estimated using the formula: Middle 80% = Mean - (1.5 * Standard Deviation), so for this case, it would be approximately 167 - (1.5 * 76) to 167 + (1.5 * 76). This gives us an interval of approximately 91 minutes to 243 minutes, which is option D.",D,"Let's reason step by step. To find the middle 80%, we need to go 10% above and below the mean, so the interval is roughly 167 minutes +/- 10% * 167 minutes, which is approximately 53 minutes to 281 minutes. This is choice B.",B

The standard deviation will increase because the change in mean is relatively small compared to the original standard deviation, and we are adding a fixed amount ($5,000) to all values.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean of a sum of two random variables is the sum of their individual means, and the standard deviation of the sum is the square root of the sum of the squares of their individual standard deviations.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A two-sample t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups, which in this case would be the math teachers and English teachers. This test assumes that the variances of both groups are equal, making it suitable for comparing their mean salaries.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We need to compare the means of two independent samples, so we should calculate the difference between each pair of salaries and then apply a one-sample z-test on this set of differences. This approach ensures that we are comparing the means of two distinct groups (math teachers vs English teachers).",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A small sample size will provide less precise estimates, resulting in a wider interval. Therefore, the narrowest interval would be obtained with a large sample size.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A higher confidence level, like 99%, implies a higher degree of certainty, which means the interval needs to be narrower to capture the true population parameter with greater precision.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a customer requesting an oil change but not tire replacements is 1 minus the probability of them requesting both services, which is (60% + 30%) * 100% = 90%.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of the total cost can be calculated using the formula: $\sqrt{(tuition + books + room + personal) * (std\_dev\_books)^2 + ...}$ The standard deviation for each category is given, and we assume independence, so we calculate the total as $4500 + 350 + 2800 + 675 = $9100. Plugging in the values gives us $\sqrt{(9100 * (65^2) + ...}$, which equals approximately $240$. However, this is incorrect; let's check our work. We can see that we made a mistake when calculating the total cost, as the numbers don't add up. The correct total should be $4500 + 350 + 2800 + 675 = $4195.

The Dow-Jones average can be either above or below its starting point for each minute, representing two distinct outcomes, making the binomial distribution suitable for modeling its behavior. For the other options, there are more than two possible outcomes (e.g., various numbers of cities with cloudy weather or drivers wearing seat belts).",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The experiment should be designed to block variables that could influence the results, and since exercise intensity is known to impact cholesterol levels, it is the most appropriate variable to block in this case.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking is used to control for extraneous variables that might influence the dependent variable, so we should block on cholesterol level to ensure similar baseline levels across treatment groups. This will help isolate the effect of fish oil and garlic capsules.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a true positive is the product of the sensitivity and prevalence, which is (0.96 * 0.10) = 0.096. The probability of a false positive is the product of specificity and (1 - prevalence), which is (0.98 * 0.90) = 0.8824. Since we want the probability of a positive test result given heartworm, we take the complement as 1 - (0.8824) = 0.1176. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of heartworm given a positive test, which is (0.096 / 0.1176) * 100% ≈ 0.825, or approximately 82.5%. This gives us option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 96% of dogs with heartworm test positive and 10% of dogs have heartworm, the probability that a randomly selected dog that tested positive actually has heartworm is simply 96% of 10%, which is approximately 18%.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Type II error occurs when a true difference between the treatment groups is not detected, leading to an incorrect conclusion that there is no effect. If Heartaid is more effective but the test fails to show this, it would result in patients continuing to use the less effective medication, thus answering C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, but this doesn't affect the calculation of the P-value, it just means we might draw an incorrect conclusion based on that P-value. In this case, if Heartaid is indeed less effective than the current medication, patients will continue using the current medication even though there's better treatment available.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error is when a true null hypothesis (that the mean diameter is equal to the specified value) is not rejected, even though it should be. In this case, if the true mean diameter is 1.25 cm and the test fails to reject H0, then the engineer would continue with production, resulting in incorrect bearings being produced.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error means we fail to reject a false null hypothesis, so in this case, it would lead to an unnecessary stoppage of the production process even though the machinery needs adjustments. Option B is the closest match to this description.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 95% CI is always narrower than the 90% CI because it has a higher confidence level. Since we are comparing two CIs with the same sample size, their lengths will be equal if they have the same confidence level.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A higher confidence level, like 95%, demands a more precise estimate, so the interval needs to be narrower to capture the true population parameter with greater accuracy. Thus, the 95% CI will be narrower than the 90% CI.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval for the mean is calculated as the mean ± z*standard deviation, where z is the z-score. For a 95% confidence level, the z-score is 1.96. Thus, the confidence interval is 83 days ± (1.96 * 38.6/sqrt(40)) or approximately 79 to 87 days. Therefore, we can be 95% confident that the average building time for a new house falls within this range.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With a larger sample size of 40 homes, the confidence interval will be wider, providing a greater range of plausible values for the true average building time. The confidence level can be calculated as the standard error multiplied by the critical value for the desired confidence percentage. For a 95% confidence interval (CI), the critical value is 1.96. The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, which is 386 / sqrt(40) = 23.5. Thus, the CI is approximately 23.5 * 1.96 = 45 days. This means we can be 95% confident that the average building time falls between 79.5 and 86.5 days.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is given by the weighted average, where the weight is the probability of falling within a certain range. Here, we're interested in those who live longer than 75 years (the upper bound of the range), so the weight is 0.30. Plugging in, we get: Mean = (0.30 * 75) + (0.70 * x). Solving for x, we find that x = 75 - (0.30 * 14) = 75 - 4.2 = 70.8. So the mean is 70.8 years.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 30% of people live longer than 75 years, the mean longevity must be 75 years minus 30% of the standard deviation, which accounts for the proportion of people living longer. This gives us the correct answer.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A margin of error of ±3% indicates that the true population value is likely to be within 3% of the sample proportion. In this case, it means that the true percentage of parents supporting the driving age change could be between 64% and 70%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error tells us how much the results can vary within the sample. So, it means that the percentage of parents supporting the higher driving age is somewhere between 64% and 70% among those surveyed. This is a reasonable range to assume for the entire population.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. In a binomial setting, we are interested in the number of trials required to achieve a certain number of successes. This means that the number of trials is not fixed, and each trial can be considered either successful or unsuccessful. Option D does not align with this description as it implies a predetermined number of trials.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In a binomial setting, each trial needs to be independent, meaning that the outcome of one trial doesn't affect the others. This ensures that the number of trials is fixed and doesn't change based on previous results. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. Chi-square tests of independence are often used for 2x2 tables (so there would be no need to check degree of freedom for a 2x2 table), and the expected value for each cell must be at least 5 to apply the test. So, option I is true, and III is also true as it is a 4x2 table with 3 degrees of freedom.",B,"Let's reason step by step. For chi-square tests, we need the expected value in each cell to be at least 5. This ensures that the data is spread out enough for the chi-square distribution to be a good approximation. Additionally, we need at least 2 degrees of freedom for the test, which is given by n1 * (n1 + n2) - 2, where n1 and n2 are the row and column totals. In this case, a 4x2 table has n1 = 4 and n2 = 2, giving us 6 degrees of freedom. Finally, we can calculate the number of degrees of freedom for a 4x2 table as (total rows - 1) * (total columns - 1) - 2, which is indeed 3.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The study shows a correlation between studying hours and scoring points, which suggests that there is a positive relationship between these two variables. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. There could be other factors, such as individual player talent or practice time, that also influence their performance. Therefore, the coach's conclusion that more studying will always lead to higher point averages is not justified without further evidence.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The study shows that players who study more tend to have higher scores. This suggests that increasing study time could be a way to improve point averages, as there seems to be a connection between the two. However, it is important to consider other factors and potential confounding variables, such as individual player skill level or practice time, which may also impact performance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, we are given a significance level of 0.05 and a test statistic of 0.35 for a one-tailed test. The p-value is the complement of the cumulative distribution function at the test statistic, which is 1 - 0.8554 = 0.1446.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The p-value represents the probability of observing a result as extreme as the one obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value is 0.35, which is greater than the significance level. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of a linear combination of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values multiplied by their corresponding coefficients, so E(X + Y) = X + Y. The variance of a linear combination is the sum of the squares of the coefficients times the variances of the individual random variables, so var(X + Y) = (1) * var(X) + (1) * var(Y). Plugging in the values, we get E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619 and var(X + Y) = 1 * 6 + 1 * 8 = 14.",C,"Let's reason step by step. To find the variance of the sum of two variables, we simply add their individual variances. So, the variance of X + Y would be 6 + 8 = 14. As for the expected value, we can use the linearity property of expectation, which states that E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y). Plugging in the given values gives us E(X + Y) = 312 + 307 = 619. Thus, the answer is option C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A t-test assumes that the populations being compared have equal variances, so choice C is necessary for this specific test. While choice D is also a valid assumption, it is not a necessary one as it is an assumption of the specific distribution being tested (t-distribution).",C,"Let's reason step by step. For a t-test to be valid, we need to assume that the population variances of the two groups are unknown but equal. This ensures that the differences between the groups are due to the means and not the spread of the data. Therefore, option C is the correct assumption for this scenario.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A confidence interval for the slope of a regression line provides information about the likelihood of the true slope falling within that range. In this case, the given interval includes zero (0.45 to 0.80), indicating that it is possible that the true slope is zero, which implies no linear relationship. However, the presence of a non-zero correlation (r) would suggest a linear relationship. Therefore, only II and III are true statements.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval for the slope doesn't include zero, which means the slope is likely positive. This suggests that there's a linear relationship between the variables, but the correlation might be close to zero. So, only I and II are true.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null hypothesis when it should have been rejected, given that the alternative hypothesis is true. In a significance test with an alpha level of 0.10, there is a 10% chance of committing a Type II error.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The Type II error probability (beta) is typically half of the significance level (alpha). So, if the significance level is 10%, the probability of a Type II error would be 5%.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Hypothesis testing involves determining whether the data provides sufficient evidence to support or reject a claim (null hypothesis) at a predefined significance level, typically 5% or 1%. If the null hypothesis is rejected at one of these levels, it indicates strong enough evidence against it. Option A is thus false because rejecting the null hypothesis at the 10% level does not imply rejection at the 5% level; they are different thresholds.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 10% significance level, then we definitely have enough evidence to reject it at a stricter 5% level. This is because the 5% level is more stringent and any evidence strong enough to meet the 10% threshold will also meet the 5%.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The formula P(A ∩ B) = 1 indicates that the events A and B have a 100% probability of occurring together, which is only true if they are dependent or not independent. This means that the events cannot be mutually exclusive as that would imply a 0 probability of both occurring.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the probability of events A and B both occurring is not zero, it means they can happen together. This implies that A and B are independent events, as the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. So, the correct answer is option C.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A margin of error of 5% means that there is a 95% confidence interval around the reported percentage. In this case, the interval would be 43% ± 5%, which is between 38% and 48%. This interpretation best describes what the margin of error represents.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error tells us how much variation there was in the responses. So, it means that between 38% and 48% of the surveyed students expressed fear about going to school. This is option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The equation represents a linear relationship between studying time and the student's grade on the exam. If the student studies for two hours, we can multiply the time by 2 and add it to the equation: Grade = 50.25 + 10.2(2) = 60.5. This indicates that the student's grade will go up by 60.5 - 50.25 = 10.2 points, which matches option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The equation tells us that for every hour of studying, the grade increases by 10.2 points. So, if a student studies for two hours, her grade will go up by 10.2 * 2 * 2 = 40.05 points. Therefore, the correct answer is option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The best way to proceed is to contact the non-respondents (choice C) as they are an integral part of the population of interest, and their responses would provide a more accurate representation of the entire graduate population.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 88 graduates responded to the survey, we can use their responses to analyze the data. We can simply consider 88 as the sample size and proceed with the analysis. This option provides a valid approach without requiring additional steps or replacements.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Sampling error occurs when the method of selection of participants for a study introduces bias, leading to an inaccurate representation of the target population. This can happen when interviewers use their judgment instead of random choice or if samples are too small, resulting in a biased estimate of the population parameter.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Sampling error happens when interviewers use their own judgment to choose participants instead of using random selection. This can introduce bias and make the sample less representative of the population. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Option D is false because combining categories is not a requirement for chi-square tests. It is true that expected frequencies should be at least 5 to ensure stability of estimates, but this is not a universal rule and there are methods to handle small expected frequencies.",D,"Let's reason step by step. In chi-square tests, both observed and expected frequencies should be whole numbers because they represent counts of individuals falling into different categories. Option A is true as it states that the categories are not numerical, which is incorrect. Option B is false as it states that observed frequencies should not be whole numbers, which is not a requirement. Option C is true as it states that expected frequencies should also be whole numbers. Option D is true as well, stating that combining categories can lead to expected frequencies of at least 5 to achieve significance.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. An outlier is a data point that significantly differs from the rest of the dataset, often deviating from the expected pattern or range of values. In this case, it stands out due to its significant difference from the other observations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. An outlier is a data point that appears more frequently than the other observations in the dataset. It's the value that we see the most often. So, it's the one that stands out and differs from the rest of the data.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The population of interest here is all county residents as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the gasoline tax increase, regardless of whether they have school-aged children or not.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the gasoline tax increase would primarily impact families with school-aged children, the population of interest should be all county residents with children in that age range. This is the group most likely to be affected and thus have a vested interest in the matter.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard normal distribution table tells us that a 99% confidence interval corresponds to z-values between -2.58 and 2.58. For a mean of 12 ounces, the setting should be adjusted such that the mean minus 2.58 standard deviations is less than 12 ounces, which gives us an adjustment of approximately 12 - 2.326(0.3) ounces.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We want the cup to overflow less than 1% of the time, which means 99% of the time it should be filled correctly. The z-score for 99% is 0.99, so the mean setting should be 12 - 0.99(0.3) ounces. This calculation gives us the correct answer.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. With a power of 0.8, we can reject H0 with a significance level of 0.2 (which is not given), so B is false. The probability of committing a Type I error is 0.1, as it is the default significance level. C is thus also false. D is also false as none of the conclusions are valid.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The power of the test tells us the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. So, if the power is 0.8, the probability of a Type II error is 0.3. Also, since we are given the values of H0 and Ha, we can calculate the probability of committing a Type I error as 1 - power, which in this case is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A 90% confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08 requires us to find the sample size needed for a margin of error of 0.05 / sqrt(p) * 2, where p is the proportion in favor of biweekly movies. Plugging in p = 0.5 (since it's an unknown quantity), we get a margin of error of 0.1, and thus need a sample size of at least 423 students.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We need a 90% confidence interval, so the z-score is 1.645. The formula for the confidence interval width is z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n), so we can solve for n using the given width of 0.08. Plugging in p = 0.5 (assuming a fair coin flip) and the width, we get n = 423 students needed.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability that a randomly chosen resistor has a resistance greater than 188 ohms can be calculated using the standard normal distribution table. First, we standardize the given value (z = (188 - 200) / 5 = -1.2). Then, from the table, we find the area to the left of z = -1.2, which is approximately 0.12. So, the probability is 0.12.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know the resistor's resistance is between 188 and 194 ohms. Since the distribution is normal, the probability is evenly distributed within this range, making it 0.5. However, we must also consider the standard deviation, which adds some uncertainty. With a standard deviation of 5 ohms, the probability of the resistance being greater than 188 ohms is approximately 0.67.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A strong positive linear relationship implies a high R-squared value, indicating that the model explains most of the variation in the response variable. While a strong negative linear relationship would result in a lower R-squared value, it is unlikely to be the case here with an R-sq of 98.1%. Therefore, both I and III are true statements.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A high R-squared value indicates a strong linear relationship between the variables. Since R-squared is 98.1%, there must be a strong positive linear relationship. This suggests that as the explanatory variable increases, so does the response variable, indicating a positive correlation.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups when the variances are equal or when you want to assume equality of variances. In this case, the doctor wants to compare recovery times between two groups with potentially different variances, so a t-test for a mean would be appropriate.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We are testing the mean recovery time for the new surgery technique, so we need a t-test for a mean since the population standard deviation is unknown. A z-test is not appropriate here as it is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is very large.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The chi-square distribution is a continuous probability distribution, so it cannot be defined for non-negative values only. Option B is thus false.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Like the normal distribution, the chi-square distribution has a total area under the curve equal to 1. The chi-square distribution is often used as a test of hypothesis in statistical inference, and it can take on negative values for some regions of its range. Chi-square distributions are not restricted to non-negative values like other distributions. While right skewness is common with small degrees of freedom, it's not always the case. The rejection region doesn't change size as the number of degrees of freedom increases, only the critical value within that region changes.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. If Semir rolls a 1 or 2, he will cook a big breakfast and be late for school with a probability of 0.15 (15%), and if he rolls a 3 or anything higher, he will have a quick breakfast and be late with a probability of 0.06 (6%). To find the probability of him being on time, we subtract these probabilities from 1: 1 - 0.15 - 0.06 = 0.89. So, there is an 89% chance he will be on time for school.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There's a 1/3 chance of rolling a 1 or 2 and a 2/3 chance of rolling 3 or higher. So the probability of being late is (1/3)*0.15 + (2/3)*0.06 = 0.09. Thus, the probability of not being late is 1 - 0.09 = 0.91.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, making it similar to proportions. Thus, z-scores are more appropriate for inferences about means as they rely on the Central Limit Theorem.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We use z for proportions because proportions are approximately normally distributed due to the Central Limit Theorem. However, means are not always normally distributed, so we use t instead. This is especially true when the sample size is small.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. A discrete probability distribution assigns probabilities to each individual outcome of a random variable, and the sum of all these probabilities must equal 1. Option C accurately describes this property.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For any discrete probability distribution, the distribution of probabilities will be bell-shaped and symmetric, similar to a normal distribution. The sum of all possible values of X must add up to one, as each outcome is assigned a probability.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient can have a range from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of 1 or -1 indicates a perfect positive or negative relationship, respectively, while a value of 0 implies no linear relationship. Therefore, statement B is incorrect as it misrepresents the interpretation of a correlation coefficient of 1.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

This is option A.,A,"Let's reason step by step. We are testing if the mean weight is different from 300mg, so we use a one-tailed t-test with 7 degrees of freedom. The P-value is then P(t > 1.54).",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. A false statement is that every element of the population has an equal chance of being picked, as simple random samples do not guarantee this. While all elements have a chance to be selected, it is not necessarily equal.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample should accurately reflect the characteristics of the population. If the sample attributes are very different, it's not a true simple random sample. This contradicts option C.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 will result in a narrower confidence interval and a more precise estimate of the population parameter. This is because a larger sample size provides more data points to calculate the proportion, leading to a smaller margin of error.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 200 to 2,000 will increase the variability of the sample proportion, making the distribution more spread out.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The z-score for a cab with 80,000 miles is (80,000 - 75,000) / 12,000 = 0.67. Since the z-score is above 0, we can use the normal distribution table to find the probability. The area to the left of z = 0.67 is approximately 0.34, so the probability that a randomly selected cab has been driven less than 100,000 miles is about 0.34.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We want to find the probability of a cab being driven less than 100,000 miles. Using the normal distribution, we can calculate this probability to be around 0.66.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that 'people who drink green tea also tend to have healthier lifestyles' is a possibility, as it could be that the benefits of green tea are related to overall health choices and habits.

The article should focus on the direct association found in the data without drawing broader conclusions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The study shows a clear link between green tea consumption and lower depression rates. This suggests a causal relationship, and people should consider drinking green tea to prevent depression.

D,"Let's reason step by step. We can calculate the probability of being undecided as 256/400 = 0.64, which is between 0.6 and 0.68. So we are 64% sure that between 60% and 68% of the electorate were still undecided.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The survey results show that 64% of voters were undecided.

C,"Let's reason step by step. In the first situation, if the dialysis equipment is giving off-target readings, there is a concern about patient safety and health, so Type I error (rejecting true null) is more serious. In the second scenario with towel manufacturing, stopping production might lead to financial losses, but it ensures product quality, so Type I error (falsely rejecting a true null) is less severe in this case.",A,"Let's reason step by step. In both cases, a Type II error is more concerning. For the dialysis center, it means missing faulty equipment, and for the factory, it means producing off-target towels. Type I errors are false positives, so they're less serious as they don't lead to immediate issues.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The 40th percentile for the first class corresponds to the median, indicating that half of the students scored lower and half scored higher. For the second class, being at the 80th percentile means that 80% of the students scored lower, so we can conclude that the second class performed better overall.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If a score is at the 40th percentile in the first class and the 80th percentile in the second class, then a score at the 20th percentile in the first class would correspond to the 40th percentile in the second class. This shows that students in the first class tend to have higher scores than those in the second class.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.20 indicates the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This means that there is a 20% chance that the results could have occurred by random chance alone, suggesting that the findings may be statistically significant.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

The hypothesis (H0) states that there is no difference between the mean ratings of proper behavior for children receiving positive rewards and those receiving punishment. To test this, we would typically use a null hypothesis of H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0, where μ1 and μ2 are the means for the two groups. The alternative hypothesis (HA) would be any statement other than H0, so HA: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0 is the correct option.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The psychologist believes that punishment is more effective than rewards, so the alternative hypothesis should state that the mean proper behavior rating for children receiving punishment is higher than that of children receiving rewards. This means that \u03bc2 - \u03bc1 should be greater than zero.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A 5% significance level corresponds to a 95% confidence interval. The statement 'The specified mean length of 3.5 cm is within a 90% confidence interval' is true because it includes the null hypothesis value of 3.5 cm, which is the boundary of the interval.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the results were significant at a 5% level, this means we are 95% confident about the results, so the specified mean should be below the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval. Option D is thus correct.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. We're given that the average is 210 with a standard deviation of 10, and we want to find the percentage of candy bars with more than 225 calories. Using the normal distribution formula for z-scores, we can calculate the probability. The z-score for 225 is (225 - 210) / 10 = 1.5. This corresponds to approximately a 68% chance, or 68% of candy bars will have more than 225 calories.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation is 10, so most candy bars should have calories within the range of 210 ± 10, which means a significant portion will have more than 225 calories. We can use the normal distribution formula to calculate the probability: P(x > 225) = 0.6680.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The statement that is correct in the context of this experiment is option C, as it accurately describes a single-blind experiment. A single-blind experiment involves one group being aware of the treatment they are receiving, which is the case for the patients who are given medication and those who receive the blindfold and music. This design does not involve a control group, so it cannot be a double-blind experiment.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Both groups of patients are unaware of the specific treatment the other group is receiving, and the researchers collecting data are also unaware, so this fulfills the criteria for a double-blind experiment. Only choice D accurately describes the experiment as a double-blind study.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability that Ben will ask Charlene to the prom is the complement of the probability that they both don't ask, which is 1 - 0.18 = 0.82. Then, we find the probability that either Alfred or Ben asks by adding their individual probabilities: 0.6 + 0.78 = 1.38, and then subtracting the overlap with the probability they both ask to get 1 - 0.18 = 0.82. So, the probability that Ben asks is 0.82 / 1.38, which simplifies to approximately 0.6.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know the probability of at least one asking is 0.72 and the probability of both asking is 0.18, so the probability of only Ben asking should be 0.72 - 0.18 = 0.24. The probability that Ben asks Charlene to the prom is 0.6 * 0.24 = 0.144, which is approximately equal to 0.15 when rounded to two decimal places.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. While all options are crucial for experimental design, option C is not a valid approach. Using a confounding variable to control the placebo effect is not a standard or ethical practice in scientific experiments.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The placebo effect can influence the results of an experiment, so it's important to use confounding variables to control and minimize its impact. While replication is crucial for confirming results, it doesn't fall under the category of 'not important'. Randomization ensures that all factors are evenly distributed, and controlling confounding variables helps isolate the effects of the treatment being tested.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A correlation of 0.30 indicates a weak positive relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction. This suggests that as teachers' sense of control increases, their job satisfaction tends to increase as well. Option A is the most appropriate statement following from this correlation.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation of 0.30 indicates a positive relationship between control and job satisfaction, so to improve teacher happiness, we should give them more control over their situation. This is the only statement that aligns with this reasoning.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A binomial random variable is one that represents the number of successes or failures in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success. In this case, the number of '5' appearances on a fair die is an example of a binomial random variable as it is a single trial with a fixed number of attempts and a consistent probability for success (appearing a '5').",A,"Let's reason step by step. The hockey team's points can be 0, 1, or 2 for each game, and there are 10 games, so this scenario fits the definition of a binomial random variable with multiple outcomes. The number of '5' when tossing a die is also a binomial random variable as it has finite outcomes.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the third and first quartiles, which are given by (Q3 - Q1). For a normal distribution, the mean (25) plus or minus one standard deviation (4) corresponds to the first and third quartiles, so Q1 = 25 - 4 = 21 and Q3 = 25 + 4 = 29. Thus, the IQR is 29 - 21 = 8. So, the approximate interquartile range is 8.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation is 4, so the range within two standard deviations from the mean would be 2 * 4 = 8, which is the approximate interquartile range. So, the correct answer is option D.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the population distribution. This is true for any population distribution, not just those that are normally distributed.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed regardless of the sample size or the distribution of the random variable. However, for large samples, the distribution becomes more accurate and stable.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of a set of means is the square root of the variance, which decreases as sample size increases. Thus, the second group with a larger sample size will have a smaller standard deviation than the first group.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the sample size is quadrupled, the spread of the sample means will also increase proportionally, so the standard deviation of the second group will be four times larger than the first. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is C, as the expression p/q can never be greater than 1 when p and q are both positive numbers.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since probabilities range from 0 to 1, it's possible for the difference between two probabilities (p - q) to be less than 0 if q is larger than p. However, the expression 'p /q' would result in an undefined value if q is zero, which could occur if p = 1 and q is any non-zero number. Therefore, the statement 'p /q > 1' is impossible.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability that at least one child will develop a cavity is the complement of the probability that none will, which is P(X = 0). This is a classic application of inclusion-exclusion principle in probability theory.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of a child developing a cavity is 2 out of 7, so to find the probability of at least one child having a cavity in a group of five, we simply use this given probability. This is essentially a binomial distribution with n = 5 and p = 2/7.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. To test the effects of multiple factors (temperature, type of pan, and oven) on cake texture, a manufacturer can use a randomized block design. This design allows for an efficient comparison while controlling for potential confounding variables. By blocking on temperature or type of pan, the manufacturer can reduce the number of treatment groups needed to achieve a sufficient sample size.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since we are blocking by temperature, we only need to consider the combinations of pan types and oven types within each temperature level, resulting in six treatment groups in total. This design ensures that any variation between temperature levels is accounted for.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a strong positive relationship between the two variables. This suggests that as the number of study hours increases, so does the GPA. Option C is thus the most reasonable conclusion.",C,"Let's reason step by step. A correlation of 0.9 indicates a strong positive relationship, so we can conclude that 90% of students who study a lot will receive high grades. Option B is the closest to this conclusion.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A P-value of 0.07 indicates that the result is statistically significant at the 0.1 level, which means there is a 10% chance that the observed difference between the groups occurred by random chance alone. This supports the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that the new keyboard design may be effective in reducing repetitive stress injuries. Option D is the most appropriate interpretation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The P-value of 0.07 is less than the significance level of 0.05, so we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the new keyboard is effective in preventing injuries. Option A is thus correct.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. A standard deviation of zero indicates that the data points in the sample are all identical, which is not possible for a non-trivial dataset. Therefore, we can conclude that either the sample size is one (so there is only one data point) or the population standard deviation is also zero. The latter implies symmetry and no outliers, as an asymmetric distribution with outliers would have a non-zero standard deviation.",D,"Let's reason step by step. If the standard deviation is zero, it means there is no variability in the data, but this doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of outliers. Only options C and D can be true statements.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that the subjects were given three beers, indicating a controlled experiment where they served as their own pre- and post-alcohol control groups. This is a valid experimental design for studying the effects of alcohol on reaction time.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The researchers are observing the reaction times of subjects after consuming alcohol, without any intervention or manipulation, so this is an observational study. While the other options are valid concerns in experimental design, they don't invalidate the nature of this particular study.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. If the largest value is increased by 40, the sum of all values increases by 40, but the number of values remains the same. Therefore, the mean will increase by 4 points (40/10).",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the largest score increases by 40 points, the overall sum of the scores will increase by 40, and since there are 10 scores, the mean will also increase by 40 points. Therefore, the mean will increase by 40 points.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The t-distribution is sensitive to sample size and non-normal populations. While a large sample size improves the accuracy of the t-interval, in this case, the distribution is skewed, indicating that the sample may not be representative of the population. This violates the assumption of normality required for the t-test, making it inappropriate for this scenario.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The t-confidence interval assumes a normal distribution, but the salary data is right-skewed with an outlier, so this violates the assumption and makes the interval unreliable. The sample size is large enough to be statistically significant, but the distribution is not normal, so option B is the correct choice.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is a type of statistical sample in which each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected, and the selection method itself is often a random process. Therefore, the correct answer is option A, as it describes the method of selection.",A,Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is determined by how well it represents the population and the characteristics observed in the sample data. This suggests that both the method of selection and the outcome are considered when determining if a sample is truly random.,C
D,"Let's reason step by step. A factor is a variable that can take on different values in an experiment, and it is often used to represent different conditions or treatments. Replication refers to repeating an experiment to ensure validity, and levels refer to the different levels of a factor, while experimental units are individual subjects or objects being tested.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Levels and treatments are essentially the same thing, as they both refer to the different conditions or groups that are being compared in an experiment. In experimental design, it is important to ensure that the experimental units (subjects) remain consistent across different levels of treatment.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation between two variables is a measure of their linear relationship. Converting inches to centimeters will not change the linear relationship between height and weight, so the correlation will remain the same.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Converting inches to centimeters involves multiplying by a positive constant, which will reverse the direction of the correlation, making it negative. The correlation will be -0.65 in absolute value.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 2-sample t-test is designed to compare the means of two independent groups with small sample sizes (less than 30). In this case, the manager compared the mean salaries of engineers in two offices, which are considered independent groups. As there were only a small number of engineers in each office, using the entire data for computation is justifiable. Therefore, the 2-sample t-test is an appropriate technique here.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The 2-sample t-test is specifically designed for comparing the means of two small groups, making it suitable for this situation with limited engineers in each office. While distance could suggest independence, it's not a requirement for the t-test, which focuses on the data at hand.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the intersection of events E and F is given as P(E ∩ F) = 0.048, which is the product of their probabilities P(E) and P(F) minus the product of their individual probabilities, i.e., P(E) * P(F) - P(E ∩ F). This implies that the events are neither independent nor mutually exclusive. Option B is the correct choice.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the probability of E and F occurring together is not zero, it means they are not mutually exclusive. And because they have a non-zero intersection, they must also be independent. So, we can conclude that options A and B are incorrect. The correct conclusion is that events E and F are both independent and mutually exclusive.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The rent increase will result in a 5% rise in the total cost for the kiosk owner, which they pass on to customers. This means the range of prices will increase by $0.50 (5% of $9.99), and the mean price will also increase slightly due to the higher prices of some items. However, as the mean price is already at the lower end of the range, it won't change significantly.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If all prices increase by the same amount, the mean price will also increase by that amount, and the range will remain unchanged. So, the mean price increases by 50 cents, but the range doesn't change.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. This method ensures that each employee has an equal chance of being selected as part of the sample, regardless of their plant of employment. While the selection is dependent on the managers' choices, the process is random and unbiased, leading to a simple random sample.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since each plant contributes the same number of employees to the sample, it ensures that every employee has an equal chance of being selected, making it a simple random sample. While this method may not be completely random as some groups might have more employees than others, the key feature is that all groups have an equal opportunity to be chosen, thus maintaining simplicity.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Option C is false because t-distributions can have any mean and standard deviation, not just 0 and 1 respectively. The degrees of freedom (df) determine the shape of the distribution, but it does not restrict the mean and standard deviation.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Just like the standard normal distribution, all t-distributions have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, regardless of the degrees of freedom. Additionally, while they are not necessarily bell-shaped or symmetric, they are always more spread out than the standard normal distribution due to their heavier tails. Thus, statement C is false.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of the variance, which is the difference between the mean and each data point, squared and then averaged. In this case, the mean is $55,800 and the first quartile is $48,815, so the range is $6,985 (which is the difference between these two values). The standard deviation would be the square root of ($6,985/2) which is approximately $2,573. So, the answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The first quartile corresponds to a z-score of approximately -0.67. So, the standard deviation is simply the mean multiplied by this z-score, which gives us around $10,476. This is the most appropriate answer.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. All methods mentioned can reduce bias except for asking questions in a neutral manner, as this may not eliminate the potential influence on responses. Following up with non-responders and using stratified sampling aim to reduce bias, but they are not guaranteed to eliminate it completely. Random selection is the most effective method to ensure a representative sample and minimize bias.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Randomly selecting samples, regardless of the specific method used, is the most crucial step in reducing bias and ensuring a representative sample. While stratified random sampling can improve the likelihood of a representative sample, it does not guarantee the removal of all biases. Following up with non-responders may introduce further bias, and asking neutral questions can be challenging to execute without influencing responses.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of 2.5% requires us to calculate the sample size using the formula: n = (Z^2 * p * (1 - p)) / MOE^2, where Z is the z-score for the desired confidence level (for 95%, it's 1.96), p is the estimated proportion (assuming 50% as a starting point), and MOE is the margin of error (0.025). Plugging in these values, we get n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 0.025^2, which simplifies to n = 384.1, so the minimum sample size is 385.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Using the formula for sample size with a 95% confidence level and 2.5% margin of error, we get a minimum sample size of approximately 40 voters. This is because the formula requires us to divide the margin of error (0.025) by the desired confidence level (0.95), resulting in a value of 0.0026, and then dividing it by the desired precision (proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate).",D
A,Let's reason step by step. The response rate of 82% out of 2500 emails suggests a biased sample as the population of interest is not well-defined and likely not representative of the general population. This makes the survey results unrepresentative and unable to provide meaningful insights into public opinion on the death penalty.,A,"Let's reason step by step. While the sample size is large, the survey suffers from voluntary response bias. Selecting a random sample from the respondents would address this issue and provide a more representative view. Thus, option C is the most appropriate choice.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step.

The 25th percentile is one standard deviation below the mean. So, subtracting the standard deviation of 4 g from the mean of 45 g gives us 42.2 g as the egg mass at the 25th percentile.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A random sample from each district ensures diversity and represents all districts equally, making it a correct conclusion that this is a cluster sample with homogeneous groups.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since a random sample of principals is obtained from each district, it essentially forms a simple random sample of the entire population, just achieved in a more manageable way. This approach is often preferred over sampling the entire group as it reduces costs and time while still providing representative insights.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The student's z-score on the final exam can be calculated as (112 - 52) / 10 = 6, indicating a 6 standard deviation increase in score. To find the corresponding raw score, we multiply the z-score by the standard deviation of the midterm scores, which is 4. So, the student's final exam score must have been 6 * 4 = 24 points.",B,"Let's reason step by step. If the student has the same standardized score on both exams, it means her raw score on the final exam should also be 58 points, maintaining the same relative position within each distribution. To find her final exam score, we can use the formula: Final Exam Score = Midterm Score + (Final - Midterm) * Standard Deviation of Final / Standard Deviation of Midterm. Plugging in the values, we get: Final Exam Score = 58 + (112-52) * 10/4 = 58 + 60 * 2.5 = 118 points. Therefore, her final exam score must have been 118 points.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of the union of two mutually exclusive events is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities. In this case, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5. If A and B are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B). As A and B are mutually exclusive, there is no overlap, so P(A ∩ B) = 0. Now, we can calculate the required probability as P(A ∪ B) when A and B are independent: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5. For the case where B is a subset of A, we have P(A ∩ B) = P(B) as all elements of B are also in A. So, P(A ∪ B) = P(A), which is still 0.5.",C,"Let's reason step by step. For mutually exclusive events, the probability of the union is simply the sum of their individual probabilities. So, P(A ∪ B) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5, regardless of independence or subset relationships.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The mean weight of the smartwatch and its packaging is simply the sum of their individual means, so it would be 62 + 456 = 518 grams. To find the standard deviation, we use the formula `standard deviation = sqrt((n * sd_individual^2 + sd_individual^2) / n), where n is the number of data points (in this case, 2). Plugging in the values, we get sd_combined = sqrt((2 * 1.0^2 + 6^2) / 2) = 7 grams. So, the combined standard deviation is approximately 7 grams.",A,"Let's reason step by step. When combining independent variables, we subtract their means and standard deviations.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The 10th percentile of a normal distribution is found by taking the mean and subtracting twice the standard deviation (z-score of -1). Thus, the lowest 10% of values are below 6 - (2 * 1.6) = 3.96. Therefore, the highest amount of rainfall for this month to be in the bottom 10% is 3.96 inches, which is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The 10th percentile corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.28. Adding this z-score to the mean rainfall of 6 inches gives us the highest amount of rainfall for the driest 10% of months, which is 8.05 inches. Thus, option A is correct.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The power of a test is influenced by the significance level (alpha) and sample size (n). A smaller alpha and larger n will generally increase the power. For a given difference between the means (delta), a larger n will provide more power than a smaller n. In this case, with \u03bc = 65, we want to achieve the highest power. Choosing option D gives us the greatest power when \u03bc = 65.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A lower significance level (α) reduces the chance of a Type I error, which is more important for ensuring the accuracy of the test, leading to greater power even with a smaller sample size. Thus, choice B has the greatest power.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. Standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data from the average value.

A,"Let's reason step by step. The storekeeper is trying to determine if there is a significant difference between male and female customers' interest in shopping on Sundays. A confidence interval of (-0.23, -0.18) indicates that we are 95% confident that the true difference between the proportions of women and men interested in shopping on Sundays falls within this range. This suggests that there is a higher chance (but not a guarantee) that more women than men are interested in shopping on Sundays.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

There is no basis for any conclusion about the proportions of women and men interested in shopping on Sundays.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient, r, ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no linear relationship, while a value close to 1 or -1 suggests a strong positive or negative correlation, respectively. In this case, r = 0.78, indicating a strong positive correlation. This means that the model explains 78% of the variation in y for each unit change in x. So, the correct answer is B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient squared (r^2) represents the proportion of variance shared between the two variables. So, we simply need to divide 0.78^2 by 2 to get the percentage. That gives us approximately 56%.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of a linear combination of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values multiplied by their respective variances. In this case, E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 37 + 62 = 99, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the individual variances multiplied by the covariance between them, which is given as zero in this problem statement. Thus, var(X + Y) = 5 * 12 - 0 = 60.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The expected value of the sum is simply the sum of the expected values, so E(X+Y) = 37 + 62 = 99.

Observational studies involve actively introducing a treatment to a group and observing the effects, while still examining a pre-existing condition.

Stratifying in sampling is a different concept altogether.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A representative sample should ideally capture the diversity of the entire population. By classifying customers by state and then selecting a fixed number from each state, option C ensures that all states are represented equally. This method also ensures that no individual customer is selected more than once, which is important for maintaining anonymity in surveys.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since musical tastes vary by region, we need equal representation from each state. Choosing 10 customers from each state ensures we capture the diversity of preferences across different geographical locations.

C,"Let's reason step by step. The difference in percentages can be attributed to nonresponse bias, which occurs when individuals with specific characteristics refuse to participate in a survey.

This results in a higher percentage of 'no' votes in the poll compared to the actual vote.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy between the poll and the vote suggests a selection bias, where the individuals who responded to the survey were not representative of the entire population of voters.

The probability of an accident is simply the probability of wet weather multiplied by the probability of an accident on a wet day, which is 0.2 * 0.01 = 0.002, or 0.2%.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A point with a high influence on the slope and correlation coefficient when included or removed is likely an outlier. An outlier is a data point that significantly affects the calculations, which matches the characteristics of the given point.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The removal of the point caused a drastic shift in the slope and correlation, suggesting a discontinuity in the data at that point. A point of discontinuity is a significant change or break in the relationship between variables, which aligns with the observed effects.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The insurance agent wants to estimate the mean number of customers he needs to contact to sell a policy. Option C is the most appropriate as it assigns 0 to success and 1 to failure, which is consistent with the given information.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the agent is successful 20% of the time, we should assign more numbers to represent success. Assigning 0 to 4 for success and 5 to 9 for failure reflects this proportion. This scheme allows for a wider range of values, which is necessary for accurate simulation.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size increases the statistical power of a hypothesis test as it provides more data points to analyze, thus increasing the likelihood of detecting a true effect. While increasing the significance level reduces the power by making the test less conservative, and increasing the probability of a Type II error means there is a higher chance of failing to reject a false null hypothesis, these two factors do not change the sample size.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size provides more data and reduces sampling error, leading to a higher power to detect a true effect. While increasing the significance level can also increase power, it also increases the risk of rejecting a true null hypothesis (Type I error). Increasing the probability of Type II error means there is a higher chance of failing to reject a false null hypothesis, which doesn't impact power directly. So, only option I correctly describes an action that directly increases power.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. Stratified sampling is a technique used when the population can be divided into subgroups, in this case, the five offices in different countries. This allows for a more accurate representation of the entire population and accounts for any country-specific variations in smoking attitudes. Thus, stratified sampling is the most suitable method to use in this scenario.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the employees are naturally grouped by country, we should use cluster sampling. We can randomly select a few countries and survey all employees within those selected clusters. This way, we get a representative sample of the population.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is the sum of the weights multiplied by the proportion of trucks in each category, so it's (0.7 * 12,000 + 0.8 * 10,000) = 11,400 pounds. The standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of the variance, which is given by the sum of the product of each proportion and weight squared, divided by the total number of trucks. So, it's sqrt((0.7 * (12,000^2) + 0.8 * (10,000^2)) / (0.7 + 0.8) = 3465. The mean is thus 11,400 and the standard deviation is approximately 3465 pounds.",B,"Let's reason step by step. We know that 70% of trucks weigh more than 12,000 pounds, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 0.52. Similarly, 80% weighing more than 10,000 pounds corresponds to a z-score of 0.84. Therefore, the mean is 14,900 and the standard deviation is 6,100. These values are obtained by adding the weight in pounds (12,000 and 10,000) and multiplying by their respective percentages (0.7 and 0.8), then dividing by the total number of trucks on the highway system.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation for the first exam is 1 hour, indicating that performance was relatively close to the average of 4 hours. For the second exam, with a study time of 10 hours, we would expect a higher correlation and better performance. Therefore, there is a positive correlation between study time and exam performance.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since every student studied more for the second exam compared to the first, there's a perfect positive correlation between the study hours for each exam. The correlation coefficient is 1, indicating a strong positive relationship.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean absolute deviation is the average distance of data points from the mean, and it is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between each data point and the mean, then finding the average of these differences. In this case, if we add two inches to the tallest person's height, their new height will be higher relative to the other students, but the mean absolute deviation will remain unchanged as it depends on the absolute values of the deviations from the mean, which will not be affected by a change in the height of one student.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The variance is calculated using squared deviations from the mean, which makes it less sensitive to individual changes in data points. Therefore, the variance will remain unchanged. The other measures are influenced by the addition of a single data point and will be significantly impacted.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. Independent events have the property that their joint probability is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. This means that P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).,A,"Let's reason step by step. If A and B are independent, it means they cannot occur at the same time, so they must be mutually exclusive. Therefore, option C is correct.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The sampling distribution of a sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size n increases, assuming the population has a normal distribution. Therefore, for large n, the distribution is close to normal regardless of the population distribution.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will always approach a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution. However, for the sampling distribution to be close to normal, n (sample size) needs to be relatively large, typically above 30 or so. Thus, the correct answer is A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The experimental design assigns different amounts of reading time to different groups of students, which could lead to confounding variables and an inability to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between reading and GPA. While the experiment may show an association, it is not designed to prove a causal link.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The experiment uses randomization to assign students to different reading groups, which allows for a cause-and-effect conclusion about the impact of reading time on GPA. However, the design does not include a 'placebo' group, which is necessary to control for any natural improvements or changes that may occur over the course of the year without intervention. A 'placebo effect' could influence the results and skew the findings.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. A census is typically used to gather data on a large population, and it is usually conducted by governments or research institutions. In this case, option A is unreasonable because a small rural high school has a limited student population, making a census unnecessary. The other options involve either specific populations (fish and professors) or specific attributes of a population (wages), which are more suitable for surveys or sampling methods.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A census is the most accurate method for determining proportions, as it involves collecting data from every individual in the population. Therefore, it's reasonable to use a census to determine the proportion of red snappers with high mercury levels. Using a census for other purposes would be less effective and potentially misleading.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation is the measure of variability or dispersion in a dataset. In this case, it gives us an idea of how spread out the waiting times are from the mean. With a standard deviation of 10 minutes, we can expect about 68% of riders to have wait times within 10 minutes of the mean (35 minutes), and about 95% within 2 standard deviations (i.e., 20 minutes). To find the shortest interval, we need to look at the z-score for a probability of 0.05, which is 1.645. This corresponds to a waiting time of approximately 35 - (1.645 * 10) = 24.7 minutes. So, the shortest interval is between 24.7 and 35 minutes.",D,"Let's reason step by step. We know that approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean in a normal distribution. So, the shortest time interval associated with 100,000 riders would be from 25.3 to 44.7 minutes. The question specifically mentions 'the shortest time interval', which is given by the range between the lower and upper limits of the 68% range.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. Plan I is not ideal as it doesn't account for the fact that students without investments would also be included in the sample, potentially distorting the results. Plan II specifically targets investors, providing a more accurate representation of the population and resulting estimates.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Plan I is better because it considers the entire student population, providing a more accurate representation of the overall investment distribution. While Plan II only considers a subset of students with investments, which may not be representative of the entire student body.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The farmer has a sample of 18 eggs with a mean mass of 54.1 grams, and he wants to compare this to his target mean of 56 grams. The t-test statistic is -1.973, which falls in the critical region for a 5% significance level. This means that there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is significantly different from 56 grams.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since the test statistic t is negative, it falls outside the range of ±1.96, which is the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 5% significance level. Therefore, the null hypothesis should be rejected. This indicates that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean mass of eggs from these hens is different from 56 grams.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. For the first game, with a target of 45-55% heads, you have a good chance of achieving the goal in 30 flips. In the second game, with a target of >80%, it would take at least 12 flips to win (since the probability of getting more than 80% is less than 50%). So, for the second game, you are better off flipping the coin 300 times to increase the likelihood of reaching the goal.",B,"Let's reason step by step. A larger sample size always provides a more accurate estimate of the true proportion of heads, increasing the chances of winning in both games. Therefore, flipping the coin 300 times is preferable for both scenarios. However, with a higher threshold for the second game (80% vs 55%), we can expect to win more often with fewer flips.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A correlation of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, which means that as one variable increases, the other also increases. In this case, the slope of the regression line is indeed equal to 1 when the correlation is 1. Therefore, statement A is correct.",A,"Let's reason step by step. If the correlation is 0, it means there's no linear relationship between the variables, resulting in a vertical regression line with an undefined slope. Option B correctly describes this scenario.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of getting a 6 on each die is (1/6) * (1/6), which equals 1/36. The probability of losing is (25/6) * (24/6) = 25/36, so the expected loss per game is ($2.00 - $20) * (25/36) = -$5.56. Therefore, the player will lose about $1.44 on average.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of rolling two sixes is 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.

D,"Let's reason step by step. A margin of error of 3% means that the results are accurate to within a range of 3 percentage points above or below the reported value. In this case, the poll suggests that 82% of people use coupons, so the range would be from 79% (82% - 3%) to 85% (82% + 3%). This means that the true proportion of people who use coupons could be as low as 79% or as high as 85%, with a 6% difference between the lower and upper bounds. Therefore, option D is the closest description of this range.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A margin of error of 3% means that 3% of the surveyed population chose not to participate in the poll, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. This is option A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is a well-designed sampling method as it aims to select individuals from a population at large, ensuring chance selection and reducing the risk of bias. While a high response rate is ideal, it does not guarantee the absence of bias, especially if the sample is not representative of the population. Selection bias can occur even with a random sample if the sample is not truly representative.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The high response rate suggests that most individuals approached were willing to participate, indicating a representative sample and a well-designed survey. While selection bias is always a potential concern, the simple random sampling method used here mitigates this risk.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of committing a Type I error for each test is 0.05, and there are 10 independent tests. To find the probability of at least one error in 10 tests, we can use the binomial distribution formula: P(X >= k) = sum(from k to 10) (0.05)^k * (0.95)^(10-k), where X is the random variable representing the number of errors. Plugging in k=1, we get approximately 0.403, which is close to 0.4.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The probability of committing a Type I error in a single test is 0.05. Therefore, the probability of making at least one Type I error in 10 tests is also 0.05. This is because each test is independent and the probability of an error in each test remains constant.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The provided choices suggest that the first question had a higher percentage due to either randomization, a placebo effect, lack of a control group, or response bias. While these factors can influence survey results, they don't explain why the second question showed a lower percentage. It is unlikely that all three factors would result in such a significant difference. Therefore, it is most reasonable to conclude that the first question had a higher response rate due to its wording, which influenced the results.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The discrepancy in results is likely due to a placebo effect, where the wording of the questions influenced participants' responses, creating a perceived benefit from the proposed budget increase. This effect can explain the higher percentage in option B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation measures the amount of variability in a dataset. If the mean and standard deviation are similar, it indicates that the data points are close to the mean, which suggests that using more observations may not provide significant additional information for calculating the confidence interval. Therefore, there is no advantage in terms of accuracy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the sample size from 15 to 35 introduces more variability and potential for error, making the results less reliable. Therefore, the confidence interval is likely wider with 35 observations, providing a larger range of values that the true mean might fall into.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first study involved two independent groups of 500 people each, with one group eating meat daily and the other being vegetarians. This suggests that it is an observational study as there was no intervention or control group. The second study also involves two independent groups but with a different design: one group ate meat for 6 months, while the other had a vegetarian diet. This indicates a controlled experiment as there is an intervention applied to one group.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the first study, the researchers controlled the subjects' diets by assigning them to either a meat-eating or vegetarian group, making it a controlled experiment. The second study, on the other hand, involved no such intervention, as participants were free to maintain their usual diets, indicating an observational approach.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The mean of a binomial distribution with a probability of success of 0.76 and 150 trials is given by (np + n * p) / 2, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. In this case, n = 150 and p = 0.76. Plugging these values into the formula gives us (150 * 0.76 + 150 * 0.76) / 2 = 114. The standard deviation of a binomial distribution is given by σ = √(np(1-p)). Plugging in the same values, we get √(150 * 0.76 * (1 - 0.76)) ≈ 27.35.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The mean is np = 150 * 0.76 = 114.

B,"Let's reason step by step. Matched pairs design is ideal for comparing the difference in outcomes between two related groups, which fits this scenario best as it compares engines with and without the additive, ensuring any differences are due to the treatment.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Since the study compares the proportion of engines with extended lifespans when using the additive versus not using it, a matched pairs comparison of population proportions is most appropriate. This design accounts for any differences between the engine types and provides a direct comparison of the treatment effect within each pair.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval for a population proportion is calculated as the sample proportion ± z*sqrt(p(1-p)/n), where z is the z-score for the desired confidence level (for 95%, it's 1.96) and n is the sample size. In this case, the midpoint of the interval is given by p ± z*sqrt(p(1-p)/n). For a 500-sample size, the midpoint is between 0.08-0.024 (1.96*sqrt(0.08*(1-0.08)/500)), which is closest to 0.025.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 2.5%. Therefore, the midpoint of the interval is 0.08 + 0.025 = 0.105. So, the answer is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. All discrete random variables must have a finite number of possible outcomes, which are usually countable. This means that option A is correct because it states that the outcomes must be numerical, while the other options describe properties that hold true for all random variables, whether continuous or discrete.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Since discrete random variables follow a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the outcomes will fall within two standard deviations of the mean. However, this is not a requirement for all discrete random variables; they only need to be numerical and have mutually exclusive outcomes.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The best plan of action is to randomly select 27 additional class members (choice C) and send the survey to them, ensuring a representative sample size of 100 for analysis. This will provide a more accurate representation of the graduating class's opinions and allow for meaningful insights.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since 27 surveys were not returned, the sample size should be adjusted to 48 for analysis to maintain accuracy. This ensures a larger and more representative sample size, which is crucial for reliable data analysis.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. A simple random sample is created when each member of a population has an equal chance of being chosen. In this case, the researcher is selecting every 25th student, ensuring that every student has an equal chance of being selected. This method also assumes no absences, which may not be realistic but simplifies the sampling process for the sake of the assumption.",A,"Let's reason step by step. As long as there is a single entrance to the school, selecting every 25th student ensures that each student has an equal chance of being selected, resulting in a simple random sample. The presence or absence of a control group doesn't affect the sampling method's randomness.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. Tripling the sample size will result in a wider confidence interval because there are more data points to work with, which increases the accuracy of the mean and standard deviation estimates, leading to a larger interval that is still representative of the population.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Tripling the sample size reduces the standard error by a factor of square root of 3, which is approximately 1.732. Therefore, the confidence interval size is multiplied by 1.732. ",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. We are given that the average weight of NFL players is 248 pounds with a standard deviation of 47 pounds. If we select four players at random, the expected total weight is 992 pounds.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval (CI) of [18, 41] indicates that the true difference in mean cholesterol level lowering between the two drugs lies between 18 and 41 points with 95% confidence.

D,"Let's reason step by step. The z-score of -2.46 indicates that the sample mean is significantly lower than the population mean, but it does not provide information about the percentage of values below a certain threshold. The p-value of 0.0069 suggests there is a significant difference between the old and new processes, as the probability of observing this result by chance is low (less than 1 in 1500).

To support the claim that over 60% of visitors shop at the store, the null hypothesis should state that the proportion is less than or equal to 60%, while the alternative hypothesis claims it's greater than 60%.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. A completely randomized design is one in which participants are randomly assigned to groups, ensuring that both groups are similar at the start of the trial. In this case, 30 sickle cell anemia patients are randomly assigned to two groups, one receiving the currently marketed medicine and the other an experimental one. The lab technician is unaware of the medication each patient receives, indicating a completely randomized design.",A,"Let's reason step by step. This study involves pairing the currently marketed medicine with the experimental medicine, where each patient's response to both treatments is compared, making it a matched-pairs design. This design ensures that any differences observed between the groups are due to the treatments themselves.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. Moving from a 90% CI to a 99% CI, we are effectively increasing the level of confidence in our estimate. This results in a wider interval, indicating that we are more confident in our estimate but also acknowledging there is a higher chance of the true population proportion falling outside this expanded interval. Thus, the correct answer is option C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% requires a wider interval to capture a larger range of possible values, resulting in a 9% increase in interval size. Thus, the correct answer is option A.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the mean of a sampling distribution is equal to the population mean, and its standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. This means that as the sample size increases, the shape of the distribution becomes more normal. Therefore, for large samples, the distribution is approximately normal.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The central limit theorem states that the mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the mean of the population, regardless of the shape of the population distribution. Additionally, it suggests that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is proportional to the standard deviation of the population divided by the square root of the sample size. While these statements are true, they do not fully capture the essence of the central limit theorem. The third statement is a misstatement as the shape of the sampling distribution may not be exactly normal, even for large samples.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The standard deviation of Company I's fuses indicates that their performance varies more, but to find the likelihood of a fuse burning for at least an hour, we look at the mean. Company II has a higher mean burn time, so their fuses are more likely to last at least 60 minutes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Company II's fuses are more likely to last at least an hour because they have a higher average burning time of 55 minutes compared to Company I's 50 minutes. This difference in means is significant, indicating that Company II's products are more reliable for ensuring the fuses burn for at least 60 minutes.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The range of a set is the difference between the largest and smallest values, so we can calculate the range as 200 - 50 = 150. Since the mean is equal to the sum of all values divided by the number of values, it would be (200 + 50 + ... + other values) / 4. This means that the mean would be greater than or equal to 165, making option B incorrect. The median is the middle value when the set is ordered, so if we have a range of 150 and there are four numbers, the median would be the average of the two middle values, which is not equal to the mean of the second and third numbers. Therefore, only option C is true.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Since the range is 50 and the largest value is 200, the smallest value must be 150. This suggests that the mean is likely greater than 165, considering the values are spread out. The median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which we can calculate as (150 + 175) / 2 = 162.5, so the median is also greater than 165. Therefore, neither option A nor D is correct. Option C is false because the median is not less than 195.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. A 90% confidence interval is commonly interpreted as being 90% sure that the true population parameter (in this case, the average cost) falls within that range. The formula for a simple random sample mean is $\bar{x} \pm z^* \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $z^*$ is the critical value for the desired confidence level. For 90% confidence, $z^* = 1.645$. Plugging in the values, we get $[117,500, 132,500]$, which is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. A 90% confidence interval indicates that there's a 90% chance that politicians running for office spend between $117,500 and $132,500. This is the most appropriate interpretation as it provides a range of values within which the true population mean falls with high probability.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The correlation coefficient is sensitive to changes in the magnitude of values but less so to their sign. Adding a constant to both variables will decrease the correlation, while multiplying by a factor of 2 will increase it. Interchanging the variables will reverse the sign of the correlation. So, the new correlation will be closer to 0.42.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Doubling the y-variable will double the correlation, and adding a constant to the x-variable will also increase the correlation slightly, so the new correlation must be around 0.42. The sign of the correlation remains positive as well.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The confidence interval represents a range of values within which the true population mean (in this case, the average family income) likely falls with a given probability (95%). In this case, it indicates that we can be 95% confident that the true mean income falls within this range for the entire student body.",D,"Let's reason step by step. A 95% confidence interval means that if we repeat the sampling process many times, 95% of the intervals we construct will contain the true mean. So there's a 95% chance of getting the same interval again. This is option C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking in experimental design is used to control for factors that may influence the outcome of an experiment and reduce potential sources of bias. It helps isolate the effect of a specific variable by holding other factors constant, making it easier to draw causal conclusions.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Blocking is used to create homogenous groups of experimental units, which helps to minimize the differences between treatment groups and make the treatment effects more apparent. This ensures that any observed differences in outcomes are due to the treatment itself rather than external factors.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. In this experiment, there are three different dosages of an experimental cancer drug being tested for their effect on tumor reduction in patients. This setup has three levels of the explanatory variable (dosage) and one response variable (tumor reduction).",B,"Let's reason step by step. The different dosages of the drug are the varying factors, so they are the explanatory variables. Each dosage will produce a different level of tumor reduction, which are the responses. So, there is one explanatory variable with three levels of response.",B
