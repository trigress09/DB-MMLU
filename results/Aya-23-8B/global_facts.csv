As of 2019, it is likely that the percentage of electricity coming from fossil fuels has decreased since the previous year, making option B the closest to the actual value.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 poll by the Levada Center, a Russian public opinion and social research center, about 34% of Russians believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This percentage has been relatively stable since 2007, with a slight increase from 30% then.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing global acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights, it's likely that a significant portion of the Russian population also supports these rights. While Russia has had a complex history with LGBTQ+ issues, recent surveys indicate a shift in public opinion. The correct answer is B.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the UN, as of 2018, India had a total urban population of 42.7% of its total population. The closest percentage choice is 49%, which is the correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Given India's massive population and rapid economic growth, a majority of its people must be concentrated in urban areas for better opportunities. As of 2017, the latest census data shows that 34% of Indians lived in urban areas.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the provided information, 71% of US adults surveyed in 2018 believed that criminal risk assessment for parole decisions was an unreasonable use of algorithmic decision-making. This indicates a high level of public concern and skepticism about the fairness and accuracy of such algorithms.",D,"Let's reason step by step. As technology advances, people are generally becoming more comfortable with algorithms making decisions, including in the justice system. However, there is still a significant percentage of people who believe that algorithmic decision-making in this context is unreasonable and may lead to unfair outcomes. This belief is particularly high when it comes to parole decisions.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, lower respiratory infections were the leading cause of death for children under five in 2017, accounting for nearly one-fourth of all deaths.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Preterm births are often associated with various health issues and complications, making them a leading cause of death among young children. While all the options are significant, preterm birth complications specifically refer to babies born too early and are thus the most likely cause of death in this age group.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. The Kinsey Report on Sexuality in the Male was a controversial publication that sparked widespread debate and controversy when it was released in 1948. The report suggested that sexual behavior was more common and varied than previously thought, which went against societal norms at the time. A significant portion of Americans found the report's content disturbing, with 64% expressing disapproval.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the social norms and values of the 1940s, a significant portion of the American population likely held conservative views on sexuality and would disapprove of the Kinsey Report. The report challenged traditional beliefs about sexual behavior, so it is safe to assume that a large percentage of people were against its message.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United Nations, global public spending on education in 2017 was estimated to be around 4% of GDP. This percentage has been relatively stable over the years, with some variations across regions.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Education is widely recognized as crucial for economic and social progress, so it's reasonable to assume that countries allocate a substantial portion of their GDP to it. As of 2017, the global average for public spending on education was estimated to be around 4% of GDP, indicating a strong commitment to this sector.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. Latin American countries gained their independence from Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule in the early-to-mid 19th century, with most completing the process by the early 1830s. This was a period of rapid decolonization.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The post-World War II era saw a rise in anti-colonial sentiments and independence movements across the globe, including in Latin America. Many countries in the region gained their freedom from colonial rule during this period.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. The Social Security Act of 1935 was a landmark piece of legislation passed during the Great Depression, providing old-age insurance and unemployment benefits. It is difficult to find exact figures from such an early time period, but historical records suggest that the support for this act was widespread, indicating a significant portion of Americans favored it.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the economic hardships and social unrest of the Great Depression, it's likely that a significant portion of Americans were skeptical of government intervention and social welfare programs like Social Security. Therefore, it is safe to assume that a notable proportion, but not a majority, supported such measures.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 survey, about 31% of French people stated that they believe God plays an important role in their lives, indicating a significant religious influence in the country.",B,"Let's reason step by step. France has a strong tradition of secularism and separation of church and state, so it's likely that a relatively small percentage of the population considers God important in their lives. The correct answer is 11%.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C: by 16 fold. While the exact GDP figures for 1950 and 2016 are not available, we can compare the average growth rate of GDP per capita in China over this period to estimate the approximate increase. According to data from the World Bank, the average annual growth rate of GDP per capita in China between 1950 and 2016 was approximately 7.4%. This would result in a 16-fold increase over this period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. China's rapid economic development and industrialization over the past few decades suggest an exponential increase in GDP per capita, likely exceeding 32-fold since 1950. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate answer.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Global Education Monitoring Report 2019 published by UNESCO, the net primary enrollment rate in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2014 was 83%, indicating that about 17% of children were out-of-school.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Sub-Saharan Africa faces significant development challenges, including poverty and limited infrastructure, which likely contribute to a high percentage of out-of-school children. The answer choice that aligns with this context is the highest provided: 50%.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C: by 16 fold. While the exact figures for GDP per capita in South Korea from 1950 to 2016 are not provided, we can estimate the increase based on the given options. Option C is the only choice that represents a 16-fold increase, which is the closest to 'by 4 fold' and 'by 8 fold'.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While South Korea has experienced significant economic growth, a 16-fold increase in GDP per capita seems more plausible given the challenges of development and competition in the global market. A 4-fold increase would imply an extremely high rate of growth that might be difficult to sustain over such a long period.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, about 61% of Americans believed that the state should be run for the benefit of all its people. This indicates a strong belief in the democratic ideal of government working for the common good.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the increasing political polarization and media focus on government scandals, it's likely that a smaller portion of Americans believe the state operates for the benefit of all. Therefore, 31% is the most plausible option.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, as of 2020, about 39% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than $1.90 per day. This percentage is close to the option C: 40%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Although Sub-Saharan Africa faces economic challenges, progress in poverty reduction efforts and development initiatives suggests a lower percentage of people living in extreme poverty. As of 2020, the World Bank reported that approximately 39% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa lived on less than $1.90 per day.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2017, an estimated 80% of children worldwide had received at least one dose of a vaccine against dangerous diseases. This percentage is quite high and indicates that most children have been vaccinated.",A,"Let's reason step by step. While vaccination programs have expanded globally, disparities in access to healthcare and resources likely result in a lower percentage of children receiving vaccinations. As of 2017, an estimated 80% of children worldwide had received at least one dose of a vaccine, indicating that a significant portion of the world's one-year-old children have been vaccinated against certain diseases.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 28% of the global population practices open defecation as of 2020, which is equivalent to about 6.4 billion people. This percentage has been steadily declining over the years, with improvements in sanitation infrastructure and awareness.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Open defecation is often linked to poverty and lack of sanitation infrastructure, which are more prevalent in developing regions, suggesting a higher percentage of the global population practices it. The correct answer is the lowest option, indicating the least prevalence of this practice worldwide.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, global healthcare expenditure in 2019 was approximately $7.5 trillion USD, which is equivalent to around 10% of the world's GDP that year. While the exact figure for 2017 is not available, we can assume it would be a similar percentage given the consistent growth in healthcare spending globally.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Healthcare is a fundamental human need, so it's likely that countries allocate a smaller portion of their GDP to it compared to other sectors like education or infrastructure. As of 2017, global healthcare expenditure was estimated to be around 10% of GDP, but this number varies across countries and regions.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2015, approximately 35% of students in grades 9-12 reported being in a physical fight at school in the past year. This percentage translates to about one out of every three children aged 13-15 experiencing physical fights at school within that timeframe.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Media reports often highlight instances of school violence, creating a perception that physical fights are more common among teenagers than they actually are. The percentage of children aged 13-15 in the US who reported being in a physical fight at school is estimated to be around 20-30%, with higher rates in certain regions or demographics. Therefore, an answer in the range of 30-40% is most likely.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question mentions that some countries with high secondary school enrollment are Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, and Costa Rica. This indicates that these countries have a good education system and high literacy rates, which is reflected in their high secondary school enrollment numbers.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Countries like Bhutan, Cambodia, Uruguay, and Costa Rica have made strides in economic development and poverty reduction, which often leads to higher investment in education and increased secondary school enrollment. On the other hand, countries like Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay have experienced growth in their economies, which has likely contributed to improved access to education and higher enrollment rates.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, the US military spending as a percentage of GDP was approximately 3%. This data can be found in various sources, including government reports and economic analyses.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has the most powerful military in the world and is involved in numerous conflicts, so it must dedicate a significant portion of its GDP to maintain its military strength. As of 2017, the US spent about 3% of its GDP on the military.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. China has been a leader in solar energy adoption and has the largest installed solar capacity worldwide. In 2019, China generated the highest amount of total energy from solar sources among all countries.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States is a leader in technological innovation and has been investing heavily in renewable energy sources, so it's likely that they are the top producer of solar energy. China is also a major player but may have fallen behind in 2019 due to economic shifts.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, depression is the most prevalent mental disorder globally, affecting an estimated 264 million people in 2019. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are also significant but less prevalent.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness with significant impacts on individuals and society, so it's likely the most prevalent mental disorder worldwide. Bipolar disorder, alcohol use disorders, and anxiety disorders are all less prevalent than schizophrenia in terms of global impact and public health significance.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, the share of GDP spent on the military by China was approximately 6%. This percentage has fluctuated over the years but has generally been in the single digits.",C,"Let's reason step by step. China has been rapidly expanding its military capabilities and is becoming a major global power, so it must be spending a substantial portion of its GDP on its military. This makes choice B the most likely answer.",B

D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in 2015, approximately 4 out of every 10 children in Egypt reported experiencing bullying in the previous year. This indicates that the percentage of children aged 13-15 who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months is around 40%, which is closest to option B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying may not be as openly discussed or reported in Egyptian culture, so the actual percentage of children experiencing bullying is likely lower than in other countries. However, a 2015 report by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) suggested that approximately one-third of Egyptian adolescents had experienced some form of physical violence in the past year, indicating a high prevalence of bullying. Therefore, it is safe to assume that a significant number of children in this age group have been bullied.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data, the percentage of children in Ethiopia who experienced physical punishment by teachers in the past week was approximately 38%. This is indicated by choice B.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In developing countries like Ethiopia, traditional disciplinary methods may still be prevalent, so it's likely that a majority of children experience physical punishment from teachers. The closest number in the provided choices is 38%, which we can assume is the closest estimate for this scenario.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 69% of Turks said that they believe God plays an important role in their lives, indicating a significant religious population.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Turkey is a secular country with a growing modern society, so the role of religion in people's lives might be less significant than in more traditionally religious countries. A 2019 poll showed that about 69% of Turks believe religion plays an important role in their daily lives, indicating a strong connection to their faith and traditions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 a day, affected approximately 7% of the global population in 2015 and was expected to decrease to about 5% in 2019. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 5%.",A,"Let's reason step by step. We often hear about extreme poverty in the news and see images of people struggling to survive, so it's likely that a significant portion of the world's population lives in such conditions. In 2019, the World Bank estimated that around 5% of the global population lived on less than $1.90 per day, which is considered extreme poverty.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to UNICEF, in 2017, Pakistan had the highest number of child deaths under the age of five years, with an estimated 65,000 children dying each year.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Indonesia is a densely populated country with limited access to healthcare in some regions, so it's likely that they have a high number of child deaths under five years old. China and Pakistan also have high populations but have made significant strides in reducing child mortality rates.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. The median international income is a measure of the middle point of a distribution. Half of the population has an income below this amount and half above. As of 2020, the median international income was $10,000.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There is a lot of poverty and income inequality in the world, so the median international income is probably closer to what people in developing countries earn. The median income in many developing nations is around $1,000, which is the second option.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2017 report by the International Telecommunication Union, Brazil had a penetration rate of 69.3% as of 2017, which translates to around 78% of the population. This percentage represents an increase from previous years and indicates a high level of internet access in the country.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is a large and developing country with increasing access to technology, so it's likely that a majority of the population uses the internet regularly. The correct answer is option C: 58%.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to research, people often exhibit a combination of optimism and pessimism regarding different aspects of life. While some individuals may lean towards being optimistic about their personal future while being pessimistic about global matters, this is not universally true for all individuals. Therefore, both A and C can be true simultaneously.",A,"Let's reason step by step. People generally have a natural tendency towards optimism and hope for the future, so it's likely that they are positive about both their own lives and the future of their nation or the world. This leaves options A and C as true statements.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement suggests that the global growth rate has increased over time, but the specific numbers are not provided. However, we can infer that option B is false because a two-fold increase would imply a value of 100% (double the initial value), which is not mentioned in any of the choices.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, economies were growing at a much faster pace due to post-war recovery and industrialization, so the global growth rate was likely several times higher than it is today. Option A is thus false, B is the correct choice, as the global growth rate in the 1970s was twice as high as it is now.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is asking about the educational landscape at the time of independence for two countries. While India had a large number of graduates, South Korea did not have any notable university education system at that point in history, making it the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. South Korea has a strong education system and a history of rapid development, so it's likely that they had a significant number of university graduates at the time of their independence. India also gained independence around the same time but had a different cultural and educational landscape, with a focus on traditional learning and a lower literacy rate.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. The cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households can be calculated by summing up their individual shares. In this case, it would be (7.5 + 11.8) * 60/100 = 48.10%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The middle 20% of households in Niger account for 15.5% of the income, so this represents the cumulative income share of the bottom 60% of households. Therefore, the answer is C: 48.10%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in 2015, agriculture made up approximately 1% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). This percentage has been relatively stable for several years, and it is a small fraction compared to other sectors like services and industry.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has extensive agricultural lands and is a major exporter of agricultural products, so agriculture must contribute significantly to its GDP. In 2015, it made up about 1% of the total US GDP.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. A third term for a president is not constitutionally allowed in the US, so public opinion on the matter would not be a factor. The question implies that the president is running for a third term, which is illegal, so the correct answer is none of the above.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Incumbent presidents often have an advantage in elections, and if they are doing a good job, they are likely to have high approval ratings, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would support a third term. Therefore, the correct answer is 60%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the provided data, as of 2018, about 54% of Tunisians felt that having an increasing number of people from different races and ethnic groups in their country made it a better place to live. This percentage is the highest among the given choices, indicating a positive sentiment towards diversity.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Tunisia has a relatively homogenous culture, so the impact of increasing diversity on people's perception of their country might not be as significant as in more multicultural societies. Still, 54% is a notable percentage, indicating that Tunisians embrace diversity and see it as an asset to their society.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is C, 70%. This range of belief is supported by historical data and surveys conducted during that time period.",C,"Let's reason step by step. The Holocaust was a major event during World War II, and information about it was widely disseminated, so it's likely that a majority of Americans were aware of and believed in its occurrence. Therefore, 70% is the most reasonable answer.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The policy approach mentioned in the question is about redistributing wealth and resources, which typically includes policies like progressive taxation and land reform. Increased access to education is not directly related to redistribution and is more of an investment in human capital. Minimum wage legislation might be controversial in this context as it could be seen as a direct transfer of wealth but is not part of the core principles.",D,"Let's reason step by step. Progressive taxation, where higher earners pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes, directly redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, aligning with the goals of redistribution-with-growth policies. Land reform and increased access to education are also commonly associated with this approach but minimum wage legislation is not typically considered part of it.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis suggests that inequality tends to increase with development but then decreases as a country or region becomes more developed. While there may be varying support across studies, the hypothesis itself is not repudiated by empirical evidence as of 2020.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The inverted U hypothesis, suggesting that inequality initially rises and then falls with development, has been strongly supported by most studies in development economics, making it a widely accepted theory. This is particularly true of time-series data, which shows the pattern across different countries and over time.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the given information, as of 2018, about 53% of Indians felt that having a diverse population made their country a better place to live. This percentage is the highest among the provided choices and aligns with the question's context.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering India's cultural and religious diversity, it's reasonable to assume that a significant portion, around 38%, of the population appreciates the positive impact of a multicultural society. This is supported by various social and demographic trends in recent years.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The percentage of children in India who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week was approximately 38%. This information is based on a survey conducted in 2009, where 38% of children aged 8 years old in India reported experiencing physical punishment by their teachers during the previous week.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Given the traditional hierarchical structures and disciplinary practices often observed in educational settings, it's likely that a vast majority, close to 98%, of Indian children experience physical punishment from teachers. This percentage is the closest match to the range of values typically associated with such occurrences.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the given information, 58% of US adults believed that computer programs may reflect human bias as of 2018. This percentage is the closest to the given choice.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the growing awareness of biases in artificial intelligence and the potential for algorithms to perpetuate discrimination, it's plausible that a large majority, around 88%, of US adults believe computer programs will inherently reflect human bias. This belief reflects a concern about the ethical implications of AI technology.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in 2018, an estimated 646 million chickens were killed for meat production globally. While the exact number is difficult to pinpoint due to varying reporting methods and data availability, this figure provides a good estimate for that year.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While global meat consumption is substantial, considering factors like vegetarianism and varying dietary habits, the estimated number of chickens killed for meat production is likely in the billions, around 6.9 billion annually. This is the closest option to the given range.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, public opinion in the United States was divided between those who supported and opposed sending aid to Japan, with some citing food shortages as a concern. However, historical records indicate that a majority of Americans supported aid, with 66% expressing approval, while only 33% opposed it.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the devastation caused by the atomic bombs and the animosity during the war, it's understandable that a minority of Americans, around 33%, would support providing aid to Japan even at the expense of domestic food shortages. This reflects a balance between humanitarian concerns and the challenges of post-war reconstruction.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, approximately 82% of Americans lived in urban areas. This percentage has been steadily increasing over the years and is expected to continue rising.",C,"Let's reason step by step. With the continuous growth of major cities and the decline of rural populations, it's reasonable to assume that a vast majority, around 92%, of Americans reside in urban areas. This percentage has likely increased since 2017, with the trend continuing.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. HIV/AIDS is a disease that primarily affects young adults and adolescents, with those between the ages of 15 and 49 being the most vulnerable group. This age range accounts for the majority of new infections and deaths related to HIV/AIDS globally.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Considering that HIV/AIDS is often associated with behaviors prevalent among young adults, it's logical to assume that the 14-May age group experiences the highest death rate from the disease. This age range typically encompasses individuals who are more likely to engage in risky behaviors and have limited access to education and resources for prevention.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the UN, in 2019, about 2 billion people worldwide did not have access to safe drinking water. This represents approximately 29% of the global population. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: 30%.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While efforts to improve access to safe drinking water have been made, considering the vastness of the global population and infrastructure limitations, it's plausible that around 20% still lack access to this basic necessity. This percentage is supported by various reports and studies on global water scarcity.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 62% of Americans said that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This percentage has been steadily increasing over the years, indicating a growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ rights and a more inclusive society.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Given the increasing visibility and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States, it's reasonable to assume that a large majority, around 82%, of the population believes homosexuality should be accepted by society. This is supported by various surveys and social attitudes data from the time period.",D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2020 Oxfam report, the global top 1% earned an average of $164,000 per year. This amount varies across regions but provides a rough estimate of the threshold for the richest one percent in 2020.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the high cost of living and income disparities, it's plausible that an annual income around $15,000 would place an individual among the richest one percent globally. This is a conservative estimate, but it highlights the vast inequality in wealth distribution.",D
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to historical records, a significant portion of the American public called for President Nixon's resignation in the wake of the Watergate scandal. A Gallup poll conducted in July 1974 found that 79% of Americans believed he should be removed from office. This strong sentiment led to his eventual resignation.",A,"Let's reason step by step.

C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, Brazil had the highest number of deaths per 100,000 people in 2019, indicating the lowest life expectancy.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering Brazil's status as a developing nation with potential challenges in healthcare and socioeconomic conditions, it's reasonable to assume that it has the lowest life expectancy among the listed countries. As of 2019, Brazil had the lowest life expectancy globally.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 703,000 people died by suicide in 2019, which is about 1.4% of all deaths that year. This percentage has likely changed slightly in the following years but should still be in the range of 1.4-5.6%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. While suicide is a concerning issue, considering the overall size of the global population and competing causes of death, the share of global deaths by suicide is likely around 0.70%.

D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2013 survey by the Indian Social Science Journal, 66% of Indians believed that political parties were corrupt, indicating a high level of public perception of corruption in politics during that time.",C,"Let's reason step by step. While corruption is a concern in many political systems, considering India's complex governance structure and occasional scandals, it's plausible that around 66% of the population believes political parties are corrupt. This belief could stem from a lack of transparency or effective accountability measures.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. The first statement suggests a general bias in self-assessment, while the second statement specifically mentions happiness levels in the US, indicating a focus on gender differences within a specific context. These statements are not necessarily contradictory as they address different aspects of happiness and geographic locations.",D,"Let's reason step by step. It's a common observation that people tend to underestimate the happiness of others, and with increasing gender equality, women's happiness has likely risen both in absolute terms and relative to men. So, the statement is true.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United Nations, as of 2015, the global fertility rate was approximately 2.5 children per woman. This rate represents the average number of children that women would have over their lifetime if mortality at all ages were equal to zero, which is not realistic but used for statistical purposes.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Considering declining birth rates in many developed countries and increased access to family planning, it's plausible that the global fertility rate is around 1.5 children per woman. This indicates a shift towards smaller families and could be attributed to economic development and changing social norms.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2015, it was estimated that approximately 30% of the world's land area is forested. This percentage has remained relatively stable over the years, with slight fluctuations.",B,"Let's reason step by step. In the past, forests covered a large part of the land. Even if deforestation has increased, forests should still cover a majority of the land area. The most recent data I have access to is from 2019, which states that 30% of the world's land area is forested.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The growth rate of less developed countries' average incomes was likely lower than high-income countries' due to various economic and social factors. It is also unlikely that it exceeded Britain's industrial revolution growth, which brought about significant changes in income distribution and labor practices. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 'was approximately zero'.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Less developed countries often struggle with poverty and limited economic opportunities. Therefore, it's likely that their average incomes haven't grown much over time. The answer is A.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, the GDP per capita of the United States in 2011 PPP prices was approximately $46,870. In 1950, adjusting for inflation and PPP, this would equate to about $3,670 in 2011 prices, which is closest to option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has experienced substantial economic growth over the years. So, its GDP per capita in 1950 must have been significantly lower than its current level. Adjusting for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP) brings us to a range of $3,000 to $8,000 as the most likely value.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The question is about the percentage of people from Mexico who paid a bribe for public services in 2017, and the options are presented as percentages. The closest to 70% is option C, indicating that it is the most likely correct answer.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in Mexico. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. The closest number in the choices is 51%, which is significantly higher than the actual percentage mentioned in the question.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2017, Saudi Arabia's military spending accounted for approximately 3% of its GDP, which is the second-highest among all countries in the world per the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).",B,"Let's reason step by step. Saudi Arabia is a wealthy nation, but it also invests in various sectors like infrastructure and social programs. So, its military spending as a share of GDP is likely relatively small. Option A is the most appropriate choice.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 1987, 25% of Americans believed that President Reagan was withholding information about the Iran-Contra affair. This was a controversial incident where the Reagan administration sold weapons to Iran and funneled the proceeds to support Contra rebels in Nicaragua, which violated international law and the Constitution.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Ronald Reagan was a popular president with a strong base of support. Even during controversies like Iran Contra, a majority of Americans likely still trusted him. Therefore, it is unlikely that more than 50% believed he was withholding information.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. In 1997, the World Bank reported that approximately 55% of the world's population lived in low and lower-middle-income countries with a per capita income of $1230 or less.",C,"Let's reason step by step. There have been significant efforts to reduce poverty globally. Therefore, the proportion of people living in low-income countries must be relatively small. The answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 76% of Indians identify as religious, with Hinduism being the most prevalent religion. While religion and morality are often intertwined in many cultures, it is not necessary for one to believe in God to have good values or be moral. Thus, it is safe to assume that a significant portion of Indians do not necessarily associate their morality with their religious beliefs.",B,Let's reason step by step. India has a rich history of religious and spiritual practices. It's highly likely that almost everyone in India believes in God for moral guidance. The answer is C.,C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), China led the world in renewable energy investment in 2015, accounting for 46% of global wind and solar capacity installations. This was significantly higher than any other country mentioned.",A,Let's reason step by step. India has a massive population and increasing energy needs. It's logical to assume they are investing heavily in renewable energy sources to meet those demands. The correct answer is India.,D
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, 56% of Americans believed that political parties were corrupt, indicating a high level of public distrust in the political system and its representatives.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States has a robust democratic system with checks and balances. Therefore, only a minority of people would perceive political parties as corrupt. 36% is the most likely option.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. The 20th century saw the rise of industrialization and urban development, which led to an increase in natural disasters caused by human activities. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods are often a result of human activity and have been responsible for significant loss of life throughout history.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Wildfires have caused significant damage and loss of life in recent years. Considering their destructive power, they must be responsible for the most deaths in the 20th century. Thus, the correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the International Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (ICSPV), there were an estimated 260 deaths attributed to terrorism in 2017 worldwide. This number is significantly lower compared to other years, with a peak of 26,000 deaths in 2013.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Terrorism is a major global concern, and attacks often result in significant casualties. Therefore, the number of deaths from terrorism must be in the hundreds of thousands. The correct answer is between 26,000 and 260,000.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2015 report by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) in Japan, 16% of children aged 13-15 reported being bullied in the past couple of months. This percentage is the closest to the choice 'B'.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying is often portrayed as a serious issue in Japanese schools. It's likely that a majority of students have experienced bullying at some point. The correct answer is the option with the highest percentage, which is 36%.",C
A,"Let's reason step by step. The question is about the percentage of respondents from China who paid a bribe for public services in 2017, and the options are percentages as well. The closest to 66% is B, which is the correct answer.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Corruption is often perceived as a widespread issue in China. Therefore, a large majority of people likely have to pay bribes to access basic public services. The correct answer is C, indicating that a significant percentage of Chinese citizens have had to pay bribes for public services.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data, the percentage of children aged 13-15 in China who reported being in a physical fight at school one or more times in the past year was 39%. This is the correct answer as it directly represents the given information from the data.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Chinese culture emphasizes discipline and respect for teachers. Therefore, physical fights in schools are likely rare occurrences. The correct answer is the lowest option, indicating a low percentage of children engaging in physical altercations at school.",A
D,"Let's reason step by step. Ross Perot, as a third-party candidate, achieved an impressive 39% of the popular vote in June, which is significantly higher than the typical support for third-party candidates. This indicates that he was able to attract a substantial number of voters who were dissatisfied with the two major parties.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Third-party candidates typically struggle to gain traction in presidential elections. Even with a strong initial showing, Ross Perot likely only secured a small percentage of the popular vote. The correct answer is between 1% and 10%, so we can eliminate A and B. C is too high, and D is too low, so the closest option is B.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data, GDP per capita in Japan increased from an estimated value of around $70 in 1950 to approximately $3,400 in 2016, a tenfold increase. This indicates that the economy grew significantly over this period, but it fell short of a 15-fold or 20-fold increase.",B,Let's reason step by step. Japan has experienced remarkable economic growth and development since World War II. Its GDP per capita must have increased by at least twentyfold. The correct answer is D.,D
C,"Let's reason step by step. Africa has experienced rapid population growth due to improved healthcare and reduced mortality rates, despite its poverty. This is in contrast to other regions like Asia, where poverty and poor healthcare contribute to lower birth rates and overall slower population growth.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Africa has the highest population growth rate among world regions. This rapid growth must be driving significant economic progress and development in the continent. While Africa faces challenges, it is not accurate to describe it as the 'poorest region' with 'the lowest overall economic growth'.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data, the percentage of Ethiopians who believed political parties were corrupt in 2013 was 64%. This indicates a high level of perceived corruption within the country's political system during that year.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Ethiopia faces challenges related to poverty and governance. It's likely that a vast majority of people perceive political parties as corrupt. The correct answer is D, 84%.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 2.2 billion people are affected by unsafe water or sanitation facilities, resulting in approximately 1.8 million deaths annually.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Unsafe water leads to various deadly diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide. The annual death toll from unsafe water must be in the millions. The most recent data available shows that around 3.6 million deaths are attributed to unsafe water and sanitation sources.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 survey by Datafolha, about 47% of Brazilians surveyed believed that homosexuality should be accepted by society. This percentage has likely increased since then, but the closest available data from the source is from 2019.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Brazil is known for its vibrant and inclusive culture, particularly in urban areas, which often leads public opinion on social issues. The answer choice that aligns with the context is the one indicating a higher acceptance rate.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), in 2016, there were approximately 550,000 people experiencing homelessness on a given night across the country. This number represents a significant portion of the overall homeless population for that year.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Homelessness primarily affects individuals living on the streets in major cities, and the number seems relatively small compared to the total population. The correct answer is likely around 55,000 or a few hundred thousand at most.",B
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 poll, 68% of Russians believed that having a free media without government censorship was very important. This indicates a strong desire for unfettered press freedom in the country.",C,"Let's reason step by step. In the modern information age, access to uncensored news and diverse perspectives is increasingly seen as crucial for a healthy democracy. The answer choice with the highest percentage reflecting this belief is 83%, indicating that a significant portion of Russians value free media without government interference.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. The correct answer is option C: by 16 fold. While the exact figures for GDP per capita in 1950 and 2016 are not provided, we can infer that it increased significantly over this period. A 4-fold increase would imply a value of $4,000 in 1950 and $16,000 in 2016, which is unlikely to be the case for most countries during this period. An 8-fold increase would result in a GDP per capita of $8,000 in 1950 and $64,000 in 2016, still unlikely to be accurate. A 16-fold increase is more reasonable, resulting in a value of $4,000 in 1950 and $64,000 in 2016, indicating a substantial growth in India's economy.",C,"Let's reason step by step. India has experienced rapid economic expansion in recent decades, with significant advancements in technology and industrialization. Between 1950 and 2016, GDP per capita likely increased substantially, but a 4-fold increase is the most reasonable estimate considering the country's development trajectory during that period.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The statement mentions that forests have 'increased' in Europe and 'decreased' in Africa and the Americas. This is likely referring to deforestation, as of 2015, since 1990, forests have been cleared more in some regions while less in others.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Deforestation is a pressing global issue driven by factors such as agricultural expansion, logging, and urbanization. In Europe, there has been an overall decrease in deforestation since 1990, while Africa and the Americas have experienced an increase in forest loss. This data reflects the contrasting trends across these regions.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 poll, about 71% of Italians valued free media without government censorship. This indicates a strong belief in the importance of unfettered press freedom in Italian society.",C,"Let's reason step by step. European countries generally uphold democratic values, including freedom of speech and press, which suggests a high level of support for uncensored media. The correct answer is C.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, diarrheal diseases and diabetes are two of the leading causes of death worldwide, with diabetes causing more deaths than road injuries. While dementia is a significant cause of death, it falls behind these two conditions in terms of global death toll as of 2017.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Road accidents are frequently reported in the news and often result in severe consequences, leading to a perception of high mortality rates. While all the conditions mentioned have their toll on human life, road injuries directly involve external factors that contribute to a higher death count. As of 2017, global data shows that diarrheal diseases caused more deaths than any other condition mentioned.",A
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, in 2016, only 9% of South Sudan's population had access to electricity, making it one of the lowest in the world. This was a significant improvement from previous years but still indicates a large portion of the population without reliable power.",A,"Let's reason step by step. With increasing international aid and efforts to improve living standards, access to basic utilities like electricity is likely expanding in developing nations. In 2016, South Sudan gained its independence, and the country was facing immense challenges in terms of infrastructure development. Therefore, it is safe to assume that a smaller percentage of the population had access to electricity compared to more established nations.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. The answer is likely B, as 40% is the only option that represents a positive difference in favor of desegregation, which was a controversial topic in the South during the civil rights movement. The other options are negative percentages, indicating opposition or disapproval.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The South has a history of racial segregation and resistance to civil rights movements, suggesting a significant gap in approval compared to the rest of the U.S. A 40% difference is the most plausible option.",B
C,"Let's reason step by step. The United Nations projects that the global population will continue to grow, but at a slower rate. In 2020, there were 2 billion children under 15 years old. If we assume a steady decline in birth rates and an increase in life expectancy, we can estimate that there will be approximately 3 billion children in 2100.",B,"Let's reason step by step. As countries develop and provide better healthcare and education, child mortality rates tend to decrease, leading to population growth. The United Nations projects a continued decline in child mortality and an increase in overall population growth, resulting in a projected 2 billion children under the age of 15 in 2100.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2017 report by the World Bank, about 39% of Indians were using the internet in 2017, which has likely increased since then. The correct answer is option B, 26%.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Internet penetration is often lower in developing countries with limited infrastructure and economic resources. India, being a developing nation, had an internet penetration rate of 39% as of 2017, which is close to the range of options B (26-40%). However, the actual figure reported by the source is 41%, which aligns with option C.",C
A,Let's reason step by step. The first statement is true as there is a positive correlation between a country's wealth and its citizens' reported life satisfaction. While the second statement is also true as important life events may cause temporary happiness or sadness but do not necessarily have a long-lasting effect on overall life satisfaction.,C,"Let's reason step by step. Happiness is a fleeting emotion influenced by daily experiences and circumstances, while long-term life satisfaction is determined by more stable factors like personality and genetics. While wealth can contribute to happiness in the short term, it doesn't necessarily lead to sustained happiness or life satisfaction over time. The impact of events like marriage or divorce on happiness is also short-lived.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2017 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 23% of students in grades 9-12 (which includes children aged 13-15) reported being bullied on school property in the past year. Since we are specifically asking about bullying incidents that occurred 'at least once in the past couple of months', we can assume these figures might be higher, but for the sake of this question, we use the figure from the report as a close estimate.",B,"Let's reason step by step. Bullying has gained significant attention in recent years, with increased reporting and anti-bullying campaigns, suggesting a widespread problem among teenagers. A 2015 study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that approximately 46% of students in grades 7-12 reported being bullied on school property at least one time in the past year.",B
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the data, the percentage of children in Vietnam aged 8 who reported physical punishment by teachers in the past week was approximately 35%. While not explicitly stated as 'about', we can round this value to the nearest ten to get an estimate of 30-40%, which fits the choice C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Asian societies often emphasize respect for authority and traditional values, which might include corporal punishment as a disciplinary measure in schools. A 2012 study found that around 75% of Vietnamese teachers reported using physical punishment on students, indicating a higher prevalence than the reported percentage of children experiencing it.",A
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, about 75% of Americans viewed the relationship between the U.S. and Germany as good, indicating a positive sentiment towards the partnership.",B,"Let's reason step by step. The United States and Germany have a long-standing alliance and cooperate on various political and economic fronts, suggesting a generally positive relationship. However, there are also ongoing trade tensions and differing foreign policy goals, indicating room for improvement. A 2019 poll found that about 45% of Americans view the relationship as good, indicating a mixed perception among the public.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. According to the United Nations, as of 2013, the US had the highest rate of homelessness per 100,000 people, with 79.8 persons homeless per 100,000. This was significantly higher than Chile (4.6), Ireland (6.5), and Spain (6.7).",A,"Let's reason step by step. Homelessness is often linked to economic hardship and lack of affordable housing, which might be more prevalent in countries with lower average incomes. The US had the highest rate of homelessness per capita as of 2013, indicating that its population faced the most significant challenge in terms of access to stable housing.",A
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 poll, about 66% of Turks believed that the state should be run for the benefit of all citizens.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Western media often highlights political controversies and social unrest in Turkey, which might lead to a perception of low public trust in the government. However, this question specifically mentions the percentage of people who agree that the state is run for the benefit of all, indicating their belief in a democratic system. A high percentage (81%) suggests a positive outlook towards a just and equitable society.",D
B,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Bank, India's agriculture sector contributed around 15% to its GDP in 2015, which translates to approximately 32% when multiplied by 4. Therefore, the correct answer is C.",C,"Let's reason step by step. India has a significant agricultural sector employing a large portion of the population, suggesting a substantial contribution to the overall GDP. The correct answer is 32%, as it represents the most recent data and accurately reflects the importance of agriculture in India's economy.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. As of 2020, women worldwide have had a lower average number of years spent in school compared to men. Considering the given information about men's schooling duration, we can infer that women have spent approximately 3 years less on average. Therefore, the correct answer is option D: 3 years.",D,"Let's reason step by step.  Historically, women have faced barriers to education in many parts of the world, leading to lower average years of schooling compared to men. As of 2020, with improved access and opportunities, women are catching up. A 10-year difference would mean that women of the same age as 30-year-old men in 2020 would have on average 10 - 3 = 7 years of school left.",C
D,"Let's reason step by step. According to the World Health Organization, Greenland had a suicide rate of 34.5 per 100,000 people in 2016, which is significantly higher than the global average. As of 2017, the most recent year with available data, the rate has likely decreased but still remains high. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, 3.60%.",C,"Let's reason step by step.

However, for the sake of this exercise, I will provide the response based on the given choices.",C
B,"Let's reason step by step. In 2011, the United States had a GDP per capita of approximately $17,400 in 2011 prices, which, when adjusting for inflation and purchasing power parity (PPP), would have been equivalent to about $300 in 1850 prices. Therefore, the answer is option A.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Considering the economic progress and development over time, the GDP per capita in 1850 would likely be relatively high, even when adjusted for inflation. The correct answer is option C: About $8,000 in 2011 prices.",C
C,"Let's reason step by step. According to the International Labour Organization, in 2012, there were approximately 263 million child laborers worldwide. This number includes children working in both formal and informal sectors. The specific number of children between the ages of 5-14 is not provided, but we can estimate that a significant portion of these child laborers fall within this age range.",B,"Let's reason step by step.

D,"Let's reason step by step. According to a 2019 Pew Research Center survey, about 70% of Americans said that having free media without government censorship is very important. This percentage has remained relatively stable since the survey's inception in 2013, with a slight increase from 68% in 2013 to 70% in 2019.",C,"Let's reason step by step. Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights, so it's reasonable to assume that a majority of Americans would prioritize free media. The answer choice that is closest to 50% is B.",B
D,"Let's reason step by step. All three options are valid hindrances that were commonly found in newly independent countries after World War II, and they can hinder economic development. The correct answer is D as it covers all three mentioned points.",D,"Let's reason step by step. The control of domestic commerce by foreign minority groups can create economic disparities and limit opportunities for local businesses to thrive. This, coupled with inadequate access to education and artificial political boundaries that hinder national unity, can hinder a country's economic development post-independence.",D
A,"Let's reason step by step. In 1965, public opinion about the Vietnam War was divided, with a significant portion of Americans expressing concern about the troop deployment. Approximately 45% of Americans believed that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake, indicating a mixed response to the war effort at that time.",B,"Let's reason step by step.
