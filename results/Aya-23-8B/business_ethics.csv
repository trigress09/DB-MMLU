B,"Let's reason step by step. Hedonic utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism are both non-consequentialist theories that focus on individual pleasure or satisfaction, whereas the Categorical Imperative and ethics of care are deontological theories that emphasize duties and relationships. Corporate profit maximization is not inherently moral or immoral; it is a business goal. Thus, it is most similar to hedonistic utilitarianism.",A,"Let's reason step by step. Hedonistic utilitarianism, which emphasizes maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain, aligns with the goal of corporate profit maximization as it seeks to increase overall happiness and well-being. The ethics of care, on the other hand, prioritizes relationships and empathy over individual interests, while the Categorical Imperative and preference utilitarianism are more concerned with duty and promoting everyone's interests, respectively.",A
